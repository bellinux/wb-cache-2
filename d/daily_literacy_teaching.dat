40|$|This paper {{describes}} a specific kind of teacher narrative (the teacher created script) {{to support the}} design of a classroom simulation to be used in pre-service teacher education. We intend to share our experiences in exploring and developing the kind of narrative text which can be developed from a large reservoir of ethnographically generated data collected from the teachers and classrooms we have closely observed and documented over the last two decades. In particular, we explore the role which these narratives play within the development of the kind of classroom simulation we have produced. Reflection has long been acknowledged as a useful process for teachers to engage with. Also, the notion of formalising such reflections through writing has been acknowledged as a way to share, refine and articulate teaching practice. As stated by Barth (2001 : 66) “…with written words come the innermost secrets of schools”. This prototype simulation allows the user to adopt the role of a Kindergarten teacher using a <b>daily</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> episode we refer to as “days of the week ” and encourages the user to reflect upon the decisions they make about the organisation and implementation of this recurring teachin...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} based on an {{embedded}} mixed methods design. In this study, qualitative data was embedded within a quasi-field experimental design. The researcher adopted quantitative methods to test the hypothesis that a combined New Literacies and Print Comprehension Strategy Instruction intervention positively influences online comprehension levels. The researcher used qualitative data produced by focus group sessions and reflective logs to explore results of the intervention. The study was conducted in a large, mixed, primary school located in North county Dublin. One hundred and sixty Irish primary school pupils participated in the quasi-field experiment (N = 160). 84 female participants (n = 84) and 76 male participants (n = 76) partook in this study. There were 40 (n= 40) participants in each condition ranging from seven to ten years. The between group independent variable was form of comprehension strategy instruction and consisted of four levels: No comprehension strategy instruction, Print Comprehension Strategy Instruction, New Literacies comprehension strategy instruction and Combined Print and New Literacies comprehension strategy instruction. The within groups independent variable was time which was measured pre-intervention (Time 1) and post-intervention (Time 2) for each condition group. The dependent variable was Online Comprehension levels which were measured using the Online Research and Comprehension Assessment (ORCA) Primary. Condition 1 was a control condition, participants in this condition did not engage in Comprehension Strategy Instruction. In Condition 2 participants received Print based Comprehension strategy instruction. In Condition 3 participants received New Literacies Comprehension strategy instruction. Finally, in Condition 4 participants received Combined Print and New Literacies Comprehension strategy instruction. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed a statistically significant increase in online comprehension levels from Time 1 to Time 2 in the combined Print and New Literacies comprehension instruction condition, z =- 2. 35, p =. 01, with a medium effect size (r =. 3). Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests revealed no statistically significant difference in ORCA Elementary revised scores from Time 1 to Time 2 in all other conditions. Thematic Analysis of focus group and reflective log data identified one main theme; The application and uses of individual comprehension strategies in online comprehension and research. Within this theme three subthemes were identified; strategies used for online comprehension research purposes; strategies used for online comprehension of static texts and strategies that were ineffective for either online research comprehension or online comprehension of static texts. The findings of this study led the researcher to conclude that while Combined Print and New Literacies Online Comprehension Strategy Instruction increased online comprehension levels, further replications are necessary to fully determine the meaning and robust nature of this increase. It is hoped that {{the findings of this study}} will have implications for classroom practice by encouraging teachers to incorporate Online Comprehension Strategy Instruction into their <b>daily</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching.</b> N...|$|E

40|$|Interview {{data are}} often {{analysed}} to produce {{reports of the}} interviewee's knowledge, views and beliefs. Another analytic perspective is to consider how interview accounts are assembled interactively between the participants through the interview talk. That is, the interviewer's questions shape the accounts of the <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> practice, because the interviewee orients her responses to the topic that the interviewer presents. This paper considers the interview construction of a teacher's description of her literary teaching practice for the Year 10 English class. These accounts produced by the teacher represent the local, practical rationale for the particular versions of <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> practice for the Year 10 English lessons. The analytic task then, is to document the teacher's logic in her explanations and descriptions and not to pre-empt her meaning.

This dissertation explored the expression of literacy education for preservice teachers in a school-university partnership. A case study approach was used to describe and analyze the experiences of preservice teachers as they learned to teach reading and language arts in an established school-university partnership. The partnership studied was well enough established as a functioning entity such that characteristics of the context could be described as partnership characteristics. The four preservice teacher informants were selected through purposeful, or judgmental, sampling to represent the typical preservice teacher in the study context. The researcher attended reading and language arts courses with the group of preservice teachers, observed partnership meetings and workshops in which preservice teachers participated, observed clinical experiences, and examined course assignments and projects completed by the preservice teachers in their internship semester. The researcher also observed four selected informants as they taught reading and language arts lessons through their student teaching semester. Data were collected through field notes, observations, time sampling, event sampling, document review, and interviews. The <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> emphasized in the partnership included balanced literacy instruction, integrated thematic curriculum, state advocated best practices, and incorporation of technology. Preservice teachers were guided to make connections between university-advocated literacy education practices and those in place in the schools. Some <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> practices used by mentor teachers had originally been introduced to them through the partnership, yet other practices were not connected to the philosophy and goals of the partnership. Data analysis revealed that the preservice teachers' <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> varied according to the following themes: engagement in effective <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching,</b> persistence in trying unsanctioned practices, efficacy for <b>teaching</b> <b>literacy,</b> mentoring impact on <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching,</b> and connections in <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> between school and university settings. A typology for preservice teacher engagement in effective literacy education within the partnership is proposed. Implications of the research for teacher education programs include the need for continued connection-making within the partnership, as well as for intensive involvement of both university and school faculty in partnership to better mentor preservice teachers to become effective literacy teachers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} first year pre-service teachers' self-reported views about <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning, {{and their own}} personal literacy and communication skills required for teaching English. It responds to the increasing pressure on today's educators to demonstrate their own English proficiency {{and to be able}} to ensure children's effective literacy learning, particularly in learning to read. Sixty-seven pre-service teachers from one large literacy foundation course completed a survey of their views on literacy. The findings showed that in spite of most participants being first year pre-service teachers the majority believed they had sufficient knowledge of the English language to <b>teach</b> <b>literacy.</b> In raising the importance of knowing how to explicitly <b>teach</b> <b>literacy</b> and engage the learner, participants emphasised the importance of lecturers providing ongoing feedback, encouragement and real-life demonstrations of explicit <b>literacy</b> <b>teaching.</b> Compared with those who entered the program with post-school qualifications, a greater proportion of the group that entered directly from school rated themselves as less confident to <b>teach</b> <b>literacy</b> and held less positive perceptions of their communication skills for teaching. Findings also highlighted that pre-service literacy teacher education courses need to identify and incorporate students' use of English language and literacy skills for specific pedagogical purposes, including teaching talk and multimediated teaching and learning. ...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{literacy}} {{is a new}} subject area which developed {{largely because of the}} concerns with respect to the low numerical literacy levels of adults. In 2006, Mathematical Literacy was introduced as an optional school subject in South Africa in the Further Education and Training band (Grades 10 - 12). This study focuses on Mathematical Literacy in-service training teacher development set in a large urban institution. The main aim {{of the study was to}} reflect on the development of meaning and understanding with respect to Mathematical Literacy curriculum interpretation and the Mathematical <b>Literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> practices of two teachers within an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) Mathematical Literacy course. The data collected over time included ACE Mathematical Literacy course tasks and videotaped observations of the <b>teaching</b> of Mathematical <b>Literacy</b> of the selected teachers related to the use of a task based on data on gender-related smoking proportions across a range of countries. The study examined the relationship between context and mathematical content when Mathematical Literacy was discussed and when classroom practice was planned and presented. A spectrum of Mathematical <b>Literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> agendas, types and cognitive levels of questions used in classroom assessment tasks and ethical and moral class discussions were analysed. The study revealed that the two teachers interpreted the Mathematical Literacy curriculum in different ways and their teaching practice resulted in a range of teaching practices with emphasis on either reallife contexts or mathematics. The study showed limited, but visible shifts in understanding with respect to meaning and practice. The key findings included the development of a range of questions for Mathematical Literacy assessment tasks, reference to the cognitive level of questions, including low-level reflective questions, the emergence of a moral value-based dimension in Mathematical <b>Literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> practice and an adaptation to the spectrum of Mathematical <b>Literacy</b> <b>teaching</b> agendas as developed by Graven and Venkat (2007) ...|$|R
