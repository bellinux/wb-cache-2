40|$|The {{prediction}} of object stability on earth requires {{the establishment of}} a perceptual frame of reference based on the direction of gravity. Across three experiments, we measured the critical angle (CA) at which an object appeared equally likely to fall over or right itself. We investigated whether the internal representation of the <b>gravity</b> <b>direction,</b> biased by either simulated tilt (rotating visual surround) or real body tilt situations, influences in a similar fashion the judgment of stability. In the simulated tilt condition, the estimated CA and the perceived gravity are both deviated in the same direction. In the real tilt condition, the orientation of the body affects the perception of <b>gravity</b> <b>direction</b> but has no effect on the estimated CA.

40|$|Conférence invitéeGravitropism, {{the turning}} {{movement}} of plants aligning to the direction of gravity is a salient trait of land plants. If its motors and early signaling have been thoroughly investigated, {{the control of the}} overall movement and its capacity to effectively align to the <b>gravity</b> <b>direction</b> has only started to be elucidated recently. This has been achieved by combining i) quantitative records of the kinematics of tropism in 11 plant species sampling angiosperms phylogeny and ii) a heuristic modelling of the dynamics and diversity of the bending and straightening process. It was shown that the sensing of the local inclination angle by statocytes is not sufficient to bring the organ back to the <b>gravity</b> <b>direction</b> after tilting. Alignment to the direction of gravity and proper control of the plant posture can only be achieved through a balanced cross-talk between gravisensing and a proprioceptive control, tending to straighten the organ. This balance is captured by a single imensionless number B that fully controls the diversity of the movement and of the final posture of the plant. Moreover, our results suggest that the proprioceptive sensitivity has been selectively tuned to avoid the two pitfalls of tropism through differential growth: curvature fixing where growth stops and passive orientation drift...|$|E

As a result of homogenization, we can treat the air flow as rotationally invariant and each curtain can be represented by one jet. This yields an enormous complexity reduction of the problem.

40|$|The present investigation, {{identifies}} the exact quantitative effects of fundamental parameters, on the detachment characteristics of isolated bubbles, emanating quasi-statically from submerged orifices into isothermal liquid pools. For this purpose, a Volume of Fluid (VOF) based interface capturing approach is further improved, for the conduction of axisymmetric and 3 D numerical experiments on adiabatic bubble growth dynamics. The {{predictions of the}} model, are quantitatively validated against literature available experimental data, showing excellent agreement. Two series of numerical experiments are performed, quantitatively exploring the parametric effects of the liquid phase properties in five different gravity levels, {{and the effect of}} the <b>gravity</b> vector <b>direction</b> inclination angle, respectively. It is found that the bubble detachment characteristics, are more sensitive in the variation of the surface tension, liquid phase density and gravity, while the effect of liquid phase dynamic viscosity is generally minimal. From dimensionless analysis, two correlations are derived, which for the examined range of Eötvos numbers, are able to predict the equivalent bubble detachment diameter and the bubble detachment time, respectively. It is also found that the bubble detachment characteristics, reduce significantly as the <b>gravity</b> vector <b>direction</b> gradually deviates from being parallel to the bubble injection orifice, following a non-linear decrease...|$|R

40|$|Panoramic visual cues, as {{generated}} by the objects in the environment, provide the brain with important information about <b>gravity</b> <b>direction.</b> To derive an optimal, i. e. Bayesian, estimate of <b>gravity</b> <b>direction,</b> the brain must combine panoramic information with gravity information detected by the vestibular system. Here, we examined the individual sensory contributions to this estimate psychometrically. We asked subjects to judge the orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise relative to gravity) of a briefly flashed luminous rod, presented within an oriented square frame (rod-in-frame). Vestibular contributions were manipulated by tilting the subjects' head, whereas visual contributions were manipulated by changing the viewing distance of the rod and frame. Results show a cyclical modulation of the frame-induced bias in perceived verticality across a 90 ° range of frame orientations. The magnitude of this bias decreased significantly with larger viewing distance, as if visual reliability was reduced. Biases increased significantly when the head was tilted, as if vestibular reliability was reduced. A Bayesian optimal integration model, with distinct vertical and horizontal panoramic weights, a gain factor to allow for visual reliability changes and ocular counterroll in response to head tilt, provided a good fit to the data. We conclude that subjects flexibly weigh visual panoramic and vestibular information based on their orientation-dependent reliability, resulting in the observed verticality biases and the associated response variabilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Foaming {{experiments}} {{in order to}} understand the evolution of the foam structure blown in different directions and levels of gravity have been carried out. The key elements of the experiment are the foam generator body (henceforth FG) and the controlled blowing apparatus. The FG was a polymer foam infiltrated with a suspension (distilled water, pure tenside (SDS, 0. 05 m%) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (2 m%)) Foams were blown out at 1. 5, 2, 4, 6, 10 and at 15 g levels in three different directions (0, 90 and 180 o, measured to the direction of the gravity vector). The elevated gravity condition was implemented in a hyper-g centrifuge (ZARM Bremen). Results show that foams can be created even at high gravity levels though the foamability and foam structure alters a lot by varying gravity level and foaming direction. At higher g-levels, under fixed gas flow rate and blowing time less foam could be produced. The average cell size varied with the blowing directions but proved constant on any gravity levels. On base of the <b>gravity</b> <b>direction</b> dependent pressure curves the foaming process was interpreted in detail. It was found that the sedimentation ruled capillary clogging is the main process by causing the <b>gravity</b> <b>direction</b> dependent foaming phenomena.

The M 3 M is a thin, large, flat, solid elliptical mirror which directs the f/ 15 beam from the M 2 M to the multiple instruments on both Nasmyth platforms. The M 3 M will weigh approximately two metric tons and the mirror support system will maintain the mirror figure at different gravity orientations. A recent reduction {{of the field of}} view to 15 arc minutes allows a reduction {{in the size of the}} M 3 M, which in turn requires re-optimization of the mirror support system.

40|$|We study an area {{preserving}} map of {{the exterior}} of a smooth convex curve in the hyperbolic plane, defined by a natural geometrical construction and called the dual billiard map. We consider two problems: stability and the area spectrum. The dual billiard map is called stable if all its orbits are bounded. We show that both stable and unstable behaviours may occur. If the map at infinity has a hyperbolic periodic orbit, then the dual billiard map has orbits escaping to infinity. On the other extreme, if the map at infinity is smoothly conjugated to a Diophantine irrational rotation of the circle, then the dual billiard map is stable. The area spectrum is the set of extremal areas of n-gons, circumscribed about the dual billiard curve; this is to the dual billiard what the length spectrum is to the usual, inner, one. We show that the area spectrum has an asymptotic expansion in even negative powers of n as n →∞. The first coefficient of this expansion is {{the area of the}} dual billiard curve, and the next is, up to a constant, the cubed integral of the cube root of its curvature. We describe the curves that are relative extrema of these two functionals and show that they are the trajectories of the pseudospherical pendulum with various <b>gravity</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R
