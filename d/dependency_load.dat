The {{aim of this}} paper is to recognize the effect of stiffener configurations, boundary conditions, mesh <b>dependency,</b> <b>load</b> patterns, geometry of plates and damping on dynamic response of the plates. Special emphasis is focused on the evolution of mid-point displacements. The results show that stiffener configuration and boundary conditions have a significant influence on the response, while the effects of damping and load pattern on maximum response are negligible. The results obtained allow an insight into the effect of stiffener configurations and other parameters on the response of the plates under uniform blast loading...|$|E

The seminar was a {{follow-up}} on a number of alternative population projections up until 2055 that have been made by the Secretariat. In order to obtain qualitative bids for the most vital issues when it comes to sustainable social – and health which are fertility, life expectancy and participation in working life, experts had been asked to submit their bid for these vital issues. The main message from the seminar was that we live longer, but not long enough; that the chances of higher fertility in the Nordic countries than at present are slim, but that a number of active measures may be taken so that more people will contribute to working life and thus reduce the <b>dependency</b> <b>load.</b> These include: Johannes Nielsen, MOMESCO & NOSOSCO, Denmark; Summary.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the structural determinants of living standards and poverty in Mozambique, which is based on nationally-representative data from the first national household living standards survey {{since the end of the}} civil war: Poverty in Mozambique is predominantly a rural phenomenon and is pervasive, with over two-thirds of the population falling below the poverty line. The degree of regional variation of poverty within the country is striking. The policy simulations that illustrate the impact that changes in the levels of determinants of poverty have on poverty levels allow us to identify six possible elements of a prospective poverty alleviation strategy for Mozambique. These include (1) increased investment in education, (2) sustained economic growth, (3) a sectoral pattern of growth favoring faster growth in the industrial and services sectors, (4) measures to raise agricultural productivity, (5) improved rural infrastructure, and (6) reducing fertility and <b>dependency</b> <b>load</b> within households. In conclusion, any meaningful poverty reduction strategy in Mozambique must give the highest priority to rural areas and must address these macro-level and household-level determinants of poverty in its policy formulations.

40|$|This paper {{decomposes}} {{changes in}} poverty into growth and redistribution components, and employs several pro-poor growth concepts and indices {{to explore the}} growth, poverty and inequality nexus in Indonesia over the period 2002 - 2012. We find a ‘trickle-down’ situation, which the poor have received proportionately less benefits from growth than the non-poor. All pro-poor measures suggest that economic growth in Indonesia was particularly beneficial for those located {{at the top of}} the distribution. Regression-based decompositions suggest that variation in expenditure by education characteristics that persist after controlling for other factors to account for around two-fifths of total household expenditure inequality in Indonesia. If poverty reduction is one of the principal objectives of the Indonesian government, it is essential that policies designed to spur growth also take into account the possible impact of growth on inequality. These findings indicate the importance of a set of super pro-poor policies. Namely, policies that increase school enrolment and achievement, effective family planning programmes to reduce the birth rate and <b>dependency</b> <b>load</b> within poor households, facilitating urban-rural migration and labour mobility, connect leading and lagging regions and granting priorities for specific cohorts (such as children, elderly, illiterate, informal workers and agricultural households) in targeted interventions will serve to simultaneously stem rising inequality and accelerate the pace of economic growth and poverty reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{construct}} a poverty profile for Sri Lanka, and examine the micro-level determinants and correlates of poverty. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on the latest Sri Lanka Integrated Survey commissioned by the World Bank. The unconditional poverty profile was constructed using three different poverty measures (poverty headcount, average poverty gap and squared poverty gap), nested in the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index. The conditional poverty profile was constructed on the basis of a multivariate analysis of poverty correlates. Partial correlates of poverty are computed using two comparable methodologies. First, a logistic regression was estimated, with the probability of a household being in poverty as the dependent variable and a set of economic and demographic variables as correlates. Second, the quantile regression approach was utilized to examine the correlates of per capita consumption at different points on the distribution. Findings – The empirical findings are broadly encouraging. The estimation results show that the education of the household head, being salary employed and being engaged in business have a significant positive effect on the standard of living. The probability of being poor increases with the household size, household head being female, living in a rural area, and being a casual wage earner. These findings indicate the importance of a set of policies which are super pro-poor, namely increasing school enrolment and achievement, effective family planning programs to reduce the birth rate and <b>dependency</b> <b>load</b> within households, and granting priorities for specific cohorts (children-, elderly-, rural- and female-headed households) in targeted interventions.

40|$|An {{automotive}} {{synchronous belt}} transmits power and assures accurate timing between the crankshaft and camshafts. The automotive industry is very competitive: there is constant pressure to increase performance and lower costs. For synchronous belts, {{this means that}} replacement intervals must be longer {{at the same time}} as the loading situation becomes more complex due to engine development. Hence, it has become important to be able to predict belt life in early design stages. This thesis covers the fundamentals of belt life predictions, namely, synchronous belt mechanics. A quasi-static load distribution model, which includes spring stiffnesses determined by a finite element based method, is presented. Since loads in an automotive synchronous belt drive are not quasi-static, a dynamic load distribution model was developed. These two models have a unique force decomposition that includes a radial degree of freedom for each pitch. It is shown that dynamic models must be used for belt profiles where friction forces take part in the power transmission {{at the same time as}} rapid load changes are present. This is due to the friction history <b>dependency.</b> <b>Load</b> distribution measurements were made under contrasting conditions: quasi-static in a simple two pulley rig and dynamic in a running engine. These measurements were made possible by a strain gauge equipped measurement pulley able to measure four of the force components calculated by the models mentioned above. The models show good agreement with experiments. The pitch difference was shown to be crucial to the load distribution; this finding could be used to optimize a belt-pulley interaction. The finding is also valid under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. During the experiments, wear-induced geometric changes that led to a redistribution of friction forces were observed. Descriptions of the three failure modes exhibited by automotive cambelts under normal operation are found in the thesis. For one of these failure modes, land area wear, a method to measure wear is devised. The method uses well-know roughness parameters derived from surface topology measurements. An investigation made on belts from test engines, points to effects from at least two land area wear types. The first is caused by the relative motion between belt and pulley during complete mesh; the second arises from counter-directional friction forces at seating and unseating. It is also shown that there exits an optimum pitch difference (in terms of wear durability); and that this optimum is shifted by a decrease in the extensional belt stiffness. The results and models presented can be used in the design of improved synchronous belt transmissions...|$|E

Numerous research and industrial tools debug par-allel performance by combing through program source or thread traces for pathologies including communication overheads, data <b>dependencies,</b> and <b>load</b> imbalances. This work takes a new approach: it ignores any underlying pathologies, and focuses instead on pinpointing the exact lo-cations in source code that consume the largest share of execution. Our new metric, ParaShares, scores and ranks all basic blocks in a program based on their share of parallel execution. For the eight benchmarks ex-amined in this paper, ParaShare rankings point {{to just a few}} important blocks per application. The paper demonstrates two uses of this infor-mation, exploring how the important blocks vary across thread counts and input sizes, and making modest source code changes (fewer than 10 lines of code) that result in 14 - 92 % savings in parallel program runtime. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors {{increase}} myocardial contractility {{and decrease}} left ventricular (LV) afterload. We studied whether these effects altered LV {{response to an}} increase in cardiac load and affected length-dependent regulation of myocardial function. METHODS: Before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, a high-fidelity pressure catheter was positioned in the left ventricle and the left atrium in 10 coronary surgery patients. LV response to an increased cardiac load, caused by leg elevation, was assessed during baseline conditions and after administration of milrinone at a dose of 20 micrograms kg- 1 over 15 min. Effects on contraction were measured by changes in maximal rate of pressure development (dP/dtmax). Effects on relaxation were assessed by analysis of changes in maximum rate of pressure decrease and by analysis of the <b>load</b> <b>dependency</b> of myocardial relaxation (R = slope of the relation between the time constant of isovolumic relaxation and end systolic pressure). RESULTS: Milrinone increased dP/dtmax but measures of relaxation were unaltered. Leg elevation had more effect on measures of contraction and relaxation after milrinone than at baseline. The relationship between R and changes in dP/dtmax shifted downwards and to the right with milrinone, whereas the relationship between R and changes in end diastolic pressure (EDP) shifted downwards and to the left.
