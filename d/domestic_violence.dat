This specific response does not prevent a rational approach: we propose to distinguish between different types of women's vulnerability.

40|$|This report delves {{into the}} nature of <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> and {{documents}} some of the work of the deeply committed people who provide services to victims and perpetrators of abuse. Overview The Special Taskforce on <b>Domestic</b> and Family <b>Violence</b> in Queensland (the Taskforce), chaired by The Honourable Quentin Bryce AD CVO, was established on 10 September 2014. The Taskforce was requested to deliver a report to the Premier of Queensland by 28 February 2015. The Taskforce’s role has been to define the <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> landscape in Queensland, and make recommendations to inform the development of a long term vision and strategy for Government and the community, to rid our state of this insidious form of violence. In doing so, the Taskforce has been guided by its Terms of Reference, as well as the stories, submissions, ideas and research provided to the Taskforce by many Queenslanders. The support from individuals, service providers and government agencies {{during the course of the}} review was inspiring and profoundly affected Taskforce members. Over the five months the Taskforce took to review the <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> landscape in Queensland, it: received 185 submissions from courageous men and women who had experienced domestic and family violence; met with 367 different groups of victims, service providers and community leaders; hosted awareness raising events in which 457 Queenslanders participated; commissioned focus groups that spoke with 164 people and considered the 961 completed surveys undertaken at the commencement of the review. In 2013 - 14, there were 66, 016 occurrences of <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> reported to Queensland police. This equates to over 180 incidents of <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> being reported every day across the state. 17 homicides relating to <b>domestic</b> and family <b>violence</b> occurred in Queensland in 2012 - 13. On average, across Australia, one woman is killed by her partner every week.
