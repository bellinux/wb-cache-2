40|$|Abstract- The study {{investigated}} the effects of different methods of application of selected mordants on dyeing woven cotton with dyes from the stem bark of Albizia coriaria. The methods of application of mordants used includes; pre-mordanting, simultaneous mordanting and post-mordanting. The effects on cotton analyzed are color fastness to; light, washing, wet and <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> and color characteristics on CIELab color coordinates. Aqueous extraction method was used to extract the dye. Some selected mordants were used for dyeing viz; alum, ferrous sulphate 1, and iron water. In the control dyeing {{without the use of}} mordants, very good fastness were registered with the following fastness ratings; for washing (4 - 5), <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> (5), wet rubbing (5) and light (4). The natural dye is a substantive dye since it registered very good fastness grades without the use of mordants. The use of mordants improved color fastness to light from ratings of (4) to (5) and (6) for iron water and ferrous sulphate and a poor fastness of (3) was recorded for alum. Post-mordanting method registered the best overall fastness results and the best color strengths K/S values and color saturation values C. However, the most brilliant colors were registered with simultaneous mordanting method with all mordants. However, there was no observable effect of mordanting methods on the redness or yellowness of color. Index Terms- Albizia Coriaria, color fastness, mordanting, substantive dye. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{environmentally}} safe pre-treatment for wool fabrics {{to improve their}} printability with acid dyes. Knitted wool fabrics treated with argon and air atmospheric plasma were evaluated in terms of printability. Printing was carried out with two different receipts under different steaming conditions. The surfaces of untreated and plasma treated wool fabrics were analyzed by SEM to compare the morphological changes. Hairiness of the fabric was investigated under light microscope. The results showed that atmospheric plasma treatment improved the hydrophility of the fiber and enhanced the adhesion and penetration of printing paste to the surface with decreasing hairiness. Increased penetration of printing paste and reduced hairiness caused higher color yield even at lower steaming durations without wetting agent. Air and argon plasma treated fabrics, especially at higher exposure durations, showed higher light fastnesses. Adversely, same samples showed a decrease in wet and <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> fastnesses which were probably caused from the deeper shade of the fabric...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dyeing and {{antimicrobial}} properties of jute fiber with natural dye henna after treatment with biopolymer chitosan. The treatment {{was carried out}} by applying chitosan solution on the fiber followed by dyeing with henna dye. Then, the performance was assessed in terms of the depth of shade by measuring K/S value and colorfastness properties of chitosan-treated dyed fabric samples. It has been observed that chitosan-treated fabrics showed a higher depth of shade compared to untreated dyed samples. As far as colorfastness is concerned, the dyed samples with and without chitosan pretreatment exhibited almost similar <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> fastness. However, chitosan-treated fabrics showed inferior fastness ratings for wet rubbing and washing, particularly for the fabrics with higher chitosan concentrations. Again, the experimental results demonstrated that the combination of chitosan and henna dye can significantly enhance the antibacterial activity of jute fiber against the organism Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings suggest that the application of chitosan and natural dye from henna onto jute fiber is an approach to get the desired dyeing and antibacterial property.|$|E

With the measurements of slip resistance, wear characteristics of two different shoes are comprehensively investigated based on the surface analyses and microscopic observations. For the systematic investigation of the surface alterations, topographic changes of each shoe were thoroughly examined on a regular time basis. The results show that surface alterations of each shoe were more severe than expected and occurred from the very early stage of sliding. It is also found that initially unstable friction process changed into the steady state friction process in the later stage of the slip resistance tests...|$|E

40|$|Rub-impact {{fault model}} for dual-rotor system was further developed, in which rubbing board is {{regarded}} as elastic sheet.

Then kinetic differential equations of rub-impact under <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> condition were established. Based on one-dimensional finite element model of dual-rotor system, dynamic transient response of overall structure under rub-impact existing between rotor wheel and sheet was obtained. Meanwhile, fault dynamic characteristics and impact of rubbing clearance on rotor vibration were analyzed. The results show that, {{during the process of}} rub-impact, the spectrums of rotor vibration are complicated and multiple combined frequency components of inner and outer rotor fundamental frequencies are typical characteristic of rub-impact fault for dual-rotor system.

30|$|The wash {{fastness}} {{ratings in}} Table  3 show that chitosan-treated and untreated jute fabrics dyed with henna dye have almost identical fastness ratings of “good” to “excellent” (within numerical grades 4 – 5) {{with very little}} variation. Again, the staining of color to adjacent multifiber fabric {{has been found higher}} for chitosan-treated dyed samples (D, E) particularly in cotton and wool fiber (3 – 4 and 3). Moreover, in case of <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> (Table  4), all types of dyed samples have shown almost similar ratings; however, chitosan-treated samples with higher concentrations represent a lower rating (3 – 4) compared to untreated samples (4 – 5) for wet rubbing. In general, deeper shade shows inferior fastness to washing and rubbing than a lighter one on a similar type of fabric for the same dyestuff (Bhuiyan et al. 2013), because in case of deep shade, dye molecules are more saturated and tend to move out from the interior of the fiber due to washing. As discussed earlier, the chitosan present in the fabric enhances the dyesite causing higher absorption of dye resulting in a higher depth of shade. Hence, as a general consequence of achieving deeper shade, the chitosan-treated fabric samples have shown a slightly lower fastness rating in comparison to lighter, untreated fabric.|$|E
40|$|Resistance to {{biofouling}} is an advantageous {{material property}} {{in a variety}} of biomedical and biofluid processing applications. Protein-resisting surface coatings must also be resistant to wear and degradation and in certain applications good aqueous lubricating properties are required. We show that cross-linked polyelectrolyte multilayers, consisting of chitosan and hyaluronan on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces, form a highly lubricating film that is resistant to wear and protein adsorption. The multilayer film shows much stronger resistance to protein adsorption from human whole saliva than both hydrophobic and hydrophilic PDMS surfaces; the latter two showed identical adsorbed salivary film thicknesses. The boundary friction coefficient under aqueous conditions was extremely low (μ 0. 01) between multilayer-coated PDMS substrates and the film is robust against <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> and many hours of tribological experiments in a range of aqueous lubricants. The origins of the assembly’s low friction coefficients and robustness are discussed. In addition, we found that the addition of negative phosphate ions to water lowers the boundary lubricating properties of negatively charged hydrophilic PDMS surfaces by 1 order of magnitude to μ 0. 01. We consider this to arise from the large hydration sheaths and resulting “ball-bearing” properties of the hydrated phosphate ions, which form a lubricating barrier against asperity contact. These findings offer new insights toward biolubrication processes and suggest that chitosan-hyaluronan polyelectrolyte multilayer films have the potential to be used in (bio-) applications requiring low friction as well as resistance to biofouling and wear...|$|E

40|$|Wool fabrics {{were treated}} by {{ultraviolet}} radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to}} obtain a strong modification onto fibers surface. [1, 2, 3] As consequence, UV treated wool showed a decrease of water contact angle, then an increase of hydrophilicity, together with a better kinetics of dye absorption under the same conditions of dyeing, obtaining a dye-bath exhaustion nearly complete. The interaction between the metal cation and new ligand groups formed on irradiated wool (such as cystine oxides and cysteic acid) is responsible for the significantly increased depth of shade with 1 :l metal-complex dyes. In support of this hypothesis, UV-C-treated wool soaked in solutions of various transition metal salts (namely Mohr's salt, copper sulphate and silver nitrate) at room temperature gave a grey/brown colour in the irradiated regions, denouncing the increased affinity. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give differential dyeing after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behavior. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of colour difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the best conditions for differential dyeing in terms of pH, temperature, liquor ratio, dyeingtime. The main interests on wool fabrics were focused on two effects: a) one colour, double face same shade but different depth, higher on treated side; b) two shades, double face - different colours.

40|$|Air foil {{bearings}} offer {{several advantages}} over oil-lubricated bearings in high speed micro-turbomachinery. With no {{contact between the}} rotor and bearings, the air foil bearings have higher service life and consequently lesser standstills between operations. However, the foil bearings have reliability issues that come from <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> during start-up/shutdown and limited heat dissipation capability. Regardless of lubricating media, the hydrodynamic pressure generated provides only load support but no dissipation of parasitic energy generated by viscous drag and the heat conducted {{from other parts of}} the machine through the rotor. The present study is a continuation of the work on hybrid air foil bearings (HAFB) developed by Kim and Park, where they present a new concept of air foil bearing combining hydrodynamic air foil bearing with hydrostatic lift. Their experimental studies show that HAFB has superior performance compared to its hydrodynamic counterpart in load capacity and cooling performance. In this article, the bearing stiffness and damping coefficients of HAFB are calculated using a linear perturbation method developed for HAFB. The study focuses on circular HAFB with a single continuous top foil supported by bump foil. The research also includes a parametric study which outlines the dependence of the stiffness and damping coefficients on various design parameters like supply pressure (P s), feed parameter (? s), excitation frequency (v), and bearing number (?). Furthermore the present research also includes experimental investigation of HAFB with bump foil as compliant structure.

As consequence, UV treated wool showed increase in metal ions absorption and hydrophilicity, together with improved kinetics of dye absorption under the same dyeing conditions as untreated wool. The surface modification of wool due to UV radiations was confirmed by FTIR-ATR analysis, nevertheless the fibre morphology by SEM analysis was unaffected. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give differential dyeing after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behaviour. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas. The main interests on wool fabrics were focused on two effects: a) one shade, double face with different depth, higher on treated side; b) two shades, double face with different colour and depth. Moreover it was found that UV pretreatment can be useful to obtain the same dyeing with lower temperature conditions (85 °C). Fastness evaluations towards <b>dry</b> <b>rubbing</b> and machine washing at 50 °C were also carried out to confirm the feasibility of this alternative dyeing technique; in all experiments carried out with selected 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes the same score of conventional premetallized 1 : 1 dyeings was obtained.
