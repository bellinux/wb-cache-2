Process cheese held in the cooker at 82 °C for up to 4 o minutes became less meltable and more firm and the emulsion became finer while that held at 82 °C outside of the cooker without agitation was only slightly affected. Loss of meltability and increased firmness associated with pro-longed cooking of process cheese {{is associated with the}} state of the fat emulsion and not with the effect of heat on the proteins per se.

The <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> {{was added to the}} cheese blend at a concentration of 0. 5 % or 1. 0 %. A control product was also manufactured, which contained monophosphate instead of polyphosphate as <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt,</b> with all other ingredients being identical to those in the experimental processed cheese spread. Half of the finished products were subjected to accelerated shelf-life testing at 37 °C for 10 days, whereas the other half of them was stored refrigerated at 4 °C for 120 days. Microbiological analyses (enumeration of viable cell counts, mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia, coliforms, yeasts and moulds) and sensory tests were performed at regular intervals. The results showed that polyphosphates had a beneficial effect on the shelf-life of the processed cheese spread tested in that they significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) the growth or survival rates of spoilage bacteria, especially of mesophilic sulphite-reducing clostridia. Polyphosphates also beneficially influenced the sensory, including textural properties of the experimental processed cheese spread. All the samples containing less than 1 % polyphosphate showed signs of butyric blowing significantly earlier (P< 0. 05), during both accelerated shelf-life tests and regular refrigerated storage, than did the products fortified with 1 % polyphosphate.

40|$|Four {{batches of}} pasteurized process cheese were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate, disodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> concentration (2. 5 %). The process cheese was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt</b> affected the physical properties of the process cheese differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on process cheese should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|E

Henceforth, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of partial substitution of sodium chloride (NaCl) with potassium chloride (KCl) and total replacement of sodium-based emulsifying salts with potassium-based emulsifying salts in the production of experimental PMC. A blend of potassium citrate and dipotassium phosphate (1 : 1) was used as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salt.</b> Changes in sensory attributes, physico-chemical characteristics, and functional properties of PMC were analyzed and compared with the corresponding changes in a control PMC made with NaCl and trisodium citrate.

It appears that potassium replacement of sodium resulted in a low decrease in casein hydration and an increase in pH and bitterness.

Model process cheeses were acidified with lactic acid and treated by addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein, four different emulsifying salts and sodium oxalate. Meltability and toughness of the model cheese increased to a maximum with increased sodium hydroxide conditioning of acid casein to pH 7. 20. These same properties decreased with addition of undenatured and heat-denatured whey protein to both casein cheese models. Loss of emulsion occurred during the meltability test of rennet casein cheese models with 3. 0 and 4. 5 % added whey protein. Emulsifying salts affected the models differently. Disodium phosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in rennet casein models eliminated the melting property. These same salts in acid casein models produced excellent meltability. Trisodium citrate produced cheeses with good meltability in both acid and rennet casein cheese models. Acid casein cheese models prepared with sodium aluminum phosphate had fair meltability and were very tender (no rupture upon compression). Chelation of calcium by sodium oxalate in rennet casein cheese emulsified with disodium phosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate improved meltability with a corresponding increase in toughness.

The main goal was to find suitable statistical models in order to describe the dependence of the hardness examined on the composition of binary mixtures. Polynomial regression proved to be suitable for the global behaviour of the statistical relationship observed. Detailed observation of local changes was made by means of a fuzzy inference system. In binary mixtures of polyphosphate combined with monophosphate, diphosphate or triphosphate, hardness was gradually increasing with rising amount of polyphosphate in the mixture. In binary mixtures of monophosphate combined with diphosphate or triphosphate, a rapid increase in the hardness of the samples was determined when the proportion of diphosphate or triphosphate in the mixture was rising up to 50 - 60 %. A further increase in diphosphate or triphosphate content in the binary mixture (above 60 %) resulted in a similarly rapid decrease in the hardness of the processed cheeses...|$|R
40|$|Processed {{products}} {{are made from}} mixes of fresh and ripened cheeses; the use of cheeses with a short shelf-life {{in the development of}} processed cheeses is an alternative for the dairy industry. A processed cheese spread was made using only a soft and fatty fresh cheese that had been stored for 25 days. The primary materials were the fresh cheese, water, and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> (sodium citrate (E- 331) and sodium phosphate (E- 450)), using a STEPHAN® Universal Machine (UMSK 24 E) with indirect vapor injection and equipped with rasping and cutting blades. The resulting cheese (A) was compared with a commercial cheese (B) for compositional, physicochemical, and sensorial characteristics. The cheeses were similar except for the fat in dry matter (FDM), with values of 54. 50 % and 47. 21 %, respectively. Sensorially, there were significant differences (P 0. 05). Cheese A provided, in mg per 100 g of product, 935. 823 for phenylalanine, 1003. 070 for isoleucine, 2041. 420 for leucine, 475. 337 for methionine, 119. 300 for tryptophan, and 758. 347 for valine. Producing processed cheeses with only fresh cheese is possible, resulting in a product that is similar to others that are currently on the market with typical characteristics that are accepted by consumers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the dependence of hardness of processed cheeses on the proportion of disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP) and/or sodium salts of polyphosphate (POLY) in ternary mixtures of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts.</b> The samples were observed during a 30 -day storage period (at 6 °C). On the second day of storage, hardness of the samples with the individual DSP, TSPP or POLY were in the range of 1. 65 - 1. 83 N, 2. 42 - 2. 81 N and 5. 98 - 6. 53 N, respectively. Within zero or a very low proportion of POLY in the mixture, hardness of the processed cheeses increased rapidly (up to 14 N) at a specific ratio of DSP to TSPP in range of 1 : 1 - 3 : 4. Hardness of the samples containing the above-mentioned specific ratio was decreasing with the rising content of POLY (up to 60 %) in the ternary mixtures. Within the prevailing content of POLY in the ternary mixtures (more than 60 %), the phenomenon of a specific ratio of DSP to TSPP was no longer observed. With the increasing storage period (up to 30 days), hardness of the processed cheeses was slightly rising (in range of 2 - 4 N) ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the use of nonfat dry milk, whey protein {{concentrate}} 34 and lactose powders in processed cheeses or cheese analogs found that increasing the percentage of lactose was associated with an increase in browning and crystallization. There has been little work done of the effects of lactose in processed cheese functionality. Therefore, the objective of this research is to build on and understand the effects of lactose from by three commercially produced dairy powders (nonfat dry milk (NFDM), whey protein concentrate 34 (WPC), lactose) and two different <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> on properties of processed cheese. Processed cheeses were made using either trisodium citrate or disodium phosphate dihydrate emulsifiers and standardized to lactose levels of 4 or 8 percent by weight. Processed cheeses were made with natural cheese aged at 4 oC for 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of age. For each age of natural cheese, processed cheeses were made in triplicates for each treatment. A small batch (5 lb) Stephan single blade cooker in a pilot plant setting was used to conduct the experiments. The cheeses were tested within a week of manufacture for moisture by microwave method, pH, melt by Arnott melt test, hardness and cohesiveness by texture profile analysis, and browning by ImageJ software. The pH of the cheeses showed that there was a significant difference...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractA {{previous}} study {{had shown that}} the method of photocentrifugation could be adapted to monitor emulsion stability of melted spreadable processed cheese (PC) with low content of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> (ES). The present study continued the experiments with higher ES content exploring the potential and restrictions of this new approach. The PC containing 40 % fat in dry matter and 1. 0 or 1. 9 % w/w ES was manufactured for 5 – 19  min at 82  °C and three different rotational speeds of the cutter. Light transmission was measured during centrifugation of the melted PC in thin cuvettes at 60  °C. The transmission profiles were used to characterize emulsion stability. Fat distribution was measured for better interpretation of the centrifugation results. An increase in transmission to ≥ 20 % occurred after different periods of centrifugation at 1200 ×g. Samples with 1. 0 % w/w ES showed different particle movements during centrifugation for 150  min. Polydisperse creaming, sedimentation, and distinct zone sedimentation were identified, the latter allowing the calculation of characteristic sedimentation velocities. The PC with 1. 9 % w/w ES manufactured at a cutter speed of 3000  rpm for 5  min required the maximum acceleration of 2150 ×g to achieve measurable transmission after 195  min, corresponding to 291  days under normal gravity. These results show the high sensitivity of photocentrifugation proving even little physical changes of the PC matrix. However, this sensitivity restricts the applications to melted spreadable and suboptimal emulsified products...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the instrumental and sensory texture of seven cheeses, as well as correlate sensory measurements of texture with mechanical properties. The cheeses were composed of different types of basic mass (casein and whey proteins) and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts.</b> Instrumental analysis of texture was performed using the universal mechanical testing machine (Instron) for determining the properties of firmness, elasticity, adhesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and cohesiveness. Data was analyzed using the principal component analysis and clustering analysis. Sensory texture was evaluated by a group of semi-trained assessors according to the ranking-difference test for texture of the products. The results were analyzed by the Friedman test; while sensory and instrumental texture measurements were correlated by the Spearman correlation coefficient. With regard to sensory and instrumental texture of the cheeses, the formation of three groups was observed: a first group consisting of cheeses with intermediate texture, another consisting of softer products and a third group formed of more consistent cheeses. Texture differences of the cheeses were determined by their protein and emulsifying agent composition. Sensory consistency presented a significant correlation (|r s | > 0. 90 and p < 0. 01) with the properties of mechanical: firmness, adhesiveness, chewiness and elasticity. On the other hand, the sensory texture measurement is not correlated with the instrumental measurements of gumminess and cohesiveness, indicating that they do not reflect the human perception of cheese texture. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} focused on {{selected}} textural and viscoelastic characteristics of spreadable processed cheese (35 g/ 100 g dry matter; 50 g/ 100 g fat in dry matter) manufactured with different ternary mixtures of <b>emulsifying</b> <b>salts</b> (ES) and from Mozzarella-type cheese (MC) with different storage periods (0, 2 and 4 weeks) {{over the course of}} a 60 -day storage period (6 ± 2 °C). The ES utilized consisted of disodium hydrogenphosphate (DSP), tetrasodium diphosphate (TSPP), sodium salt of polyphosphate with mean length n ≈ 20 (P 20), and trisodium citrate (TSC). Furthermore, the hardest samples were those manufactured from DSP and TSPP in a ratio 1 : 1. This ratio resulted in processed cheese with the highest values of gel strength and interaction factor. When TSC was utilized in the mixtures, the hardness of the samples rose with the increase of P 20 (≥ 50 %). Additionally, when DSP, TSC, TSPP, and P 20 were added as sole ingredients, hardness decreased in the following order: P 20 > TSPP ≈ TSC > DSP. This trend was also observed with the values of gel strength and interaction factor. The hardness of all samples increased with increased storage periods. However, the hardness values dropped in relation to an increase in the storage period of the MC. © 2016 Elsevier LtdIGA/FT/ 2015 / 004, UTB, Tomas Bata University in Zlín; IGA/FT/ 2016 / 003, UTB, Tomas Bata University in Zlíninternal grant agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic [IGA/FT/ 2015 / 004, IGA/FT/ 2016 / 003...|$|R
