5|$|Chief Rubin {{initially}} confirmed four fatalities (including {{the train}} operator) and 74 injuries, 14 {{of which were}} considered moderate and 6 critical. Five of the dead were discovered in the wreckage and removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the collision {{on the morning of}} June 23, as cranes dismantling the wrecked trains revealed the bodies. Nine fatalities were eventually confirmed. Major General (ret.) David F. Wherley, Jr. of the District of Columbia Air National Guard – known for deploying fighter jets to defend Washington, D.C. during the September 11 attacks – was killed in the collision along with his wife, Ann; the other passengers killed in the crash were Lavonda King, Veronica DuBose, Cameron Williams, Dennis Hawkins, Mary Doolittle, and Ana Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, a new {{interchange}} {{was built}} between NY134 and the Taconic State Parkway {{as part of}} the construction of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. During the excavation process for the junction, a bone from a woolly mammoth (colloquially known as Jefferson's mammoth) was found buried in the earth below. The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany. The construction also required the relocation of the Kitchawan Tavern <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and Chadeanye roads a half-mile (0.8km) to the east.|$|E
5|$|Malvern has a {{community}} hospital in Malvern Link. The hospital was constructed {{on the grounds}} of a former independent preparatory school, Seaford Court, and began operation in 2010. It was officially opened by The Princess Royal in March 2011. Major health facilities are provided by hospitals in Worcester. The town has seven health centres, including a health complex in Malvern Link and a group practice on Pickersleigh Road. Malvern also has several nursing and retirement homes for the care of senior citizens. The Malvern area is covered by the Midlands Air Ambulance service, which has operated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> Strensham motorway services since 1991.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus zapfei is {{a fossil}} bat in the genus Miniopterus {{from the middle}} Miocene of France. First {{described}} in 2002, it is known only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> La Grive M, where it occurs with another fossil Miniopterus species, the smaller and more common Miniopterus fossilis. M.zapfei is known from five mandibles (lower jaws) and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). The fourth lower premolar is more slender than in M.fossilis and the cingulum shelf surrounding the P4 is less well-developed than in living Miniopterus. The length of the first lower molar is 1.57 to 1.60mm.|$|E
5|$|Rescued crewmen {{believed}} that they had hit a mine that detonated one of the ship's magazines. Vice Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Martins—Brazil's chief of naval intelligence—thought that Bahia could have been mined or torpedoed by , which surrendered under strange circumstances in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on 10 July (some two months after Germany's surrender), but the Argentine Naval Ministry stated {{that it would have}} been impossible for the submarine to travel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the sinking to Mar del Plata in six days (4–10 July). The U-977, which crew was also heading to Argentina seeking for asylum, was also accused of sinking Bahia. However, military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies, concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident.|$|E
5|$|The Victorian square font and pulpit match, but are now largely whitewashed, as is much of {{the rest}} of the church. Just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court by Queen Elizabeth I.

40|$|We have visualized the intranuclear {{topography}} of adenovirus replication and transcription in infected HeLa cells. The {{results show that}} viral DNA replication occurs in multiple foci that are highly organized in the nucleoplasm. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that newly synthesized viral double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> replication foci and spread throughout the nucleoplasm, while the single-stranded DNA replication intermediates accumulate in adjacent sites. Double-labelling experiments and confocal microscopy show that replication occurs in foci localized at <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> where single-stranded DNA accumulates. The simultaneous visualization of viral replication and transcription reveals that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription are predominantly separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. Transcription is detected adjacent to the replication foci and extends around <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> single-stranded DNA accumulation. These data indicate that newly synthesized double-stranded DNA molecules are displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> replication foci and spread in the surrounding nucleoplasm, where they are used as templates for transcription. Splicing snRNPs are shown to co-localize with <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> transcription and to be excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> replication. This provides evidence that splicing of viral RNAs occurs co-transcriptionally and that <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> viral DNA replication are spatially distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> RNA transcription and processing...|$|R

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, erosion {{resulting}} from heavy rains exposed human remains near the westbound lanes of Route 37 in Cranston. Subsequent drainage {{improvements to the}} freeway led {{to the discovery of}} human remains from more than 70 individuals buried in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Archaeological research indicated that the portion of Route 37 in Cranston between Exits 2 and 3 was inadvertently constructed over a portion of the State Farm Cemetery in the 1960s. The cemetery's wooden burial markers had deteriorated by the time Route 37 was constructed, and environmental studies that would have indicated the location of the cemetery were not conducted prior to the expressway's construction. In late 2006, the remains of 71 individuals were exhumed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the previous cemetery and re-interred at the State Institution Cemetery in Warwick. On July 14, 2009, RIDOT hosted a memorial service for the 71 people re-interred in Warwick.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E

5|$|East of Williamstown, US 322 {{follows the}} Black Horse Pike, a turnpike between Camden and Atlantic City {{that was created}} in 1855. Pre-1927 Route 18S was {{designated}} along {{the portion of the}} current route east of McKee City in 1923, with the US 40 designation along this portion following in 1926. In 1927, Route 18S became Route 48 and Route 42 was designated along the road between Williamstown and McKee City. US 322 was extended to New Jersey in 1936, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport east to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1938, Route 55 was legislated along US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City while in 1939, US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now US 130) became Route S44 and the route between there and Route 42 became Route 51. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US 322. After the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974, the old approach to the ferry dock became Route 324. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for US 322 in Gloucester County, running <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the Commodore Barry Bridge to Williamstown. This $59.6 million proposal was canceled by the 1970s due to diversion of funds to mass transit. Subsequent proposals for freeways in 1983 and 1995 also failed. A bypass of Mullica Hill was completed in 2012 for US 322 in order to relieve traffic through that town; the former alignment is now unsigned US 322 Bus.|$|E
