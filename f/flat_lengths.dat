40|$|AbstractRecently {{the notions}} of sfliΓ, the {{supremum}} of the <b>flat</b> <b>lengths</b> of injective Γ-modules, and silfΓ, the supremum of the injective lengths of flat Γ-modules have been studied by some authors. These homological invariants are based on spli and silp invariants of Gedrich and Gruenberg and it is shown that they have enough potential {{to play an important}} role in studying homological conjectures in cohomology of groups. In this paper we will study these invariants. It turns out that, for any group Γ, the finiteness of silfΓ implies the finiteness of sfliΓ, but the converse is not known. We investigate the situation in which sfliΓ<∞ implies silfΓ<∞. The statement holds for example, for groups Γ with the property that flat Γ-modules have finite projective dimension. Moreover, we show that the Gorenstein flat dimension of the trivial ZΓ-module Z, that will be called Gorenstein homological dimension of Γ, denoted GhdΓ, is completely related to these invariants...|$|E

Influences of the train speed, <b>flat</b> <b>length</b> and axle load on the vertical wheel–rail impact response were discussed, respectively. Some main conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) the maximum vertical wheel–rail impact forces are greater significantly than the corresponding static axle loads due {{to the presence of}} a wheel flat; (2) the maximum von Mises equivalent stress and maximum equivalent plastic strain occur on the wheel–rail contact surface, and they are sensitive to the train speed, <b>flat</b> <b>length</b> and axle load; (3) the wheel–rail impact force caused by a flat has non-monotonic change with the train speed, and the corresponding peak value occurs within the range from 150 to 200  km/h; (4) the vertical impact force increases with the <b>flat</b> <b>length,</b> and the approximately linear relationship between the maximum values of wheel–rail impact responses (including the force, von Mises equivalent stress and equivalent plastic strain) and axle load is found for each <b>flat</b> <b>length.</b>|$|R

This paper investigates the occurrence of this non-uniform by calculating the stress distribution in circumferential and axial direction.

40|$|Summary Nominally flat {{contacts}} {{are representative}} of various components like blade/disk contacts in aircraft engines. In literature, there are only numerical solutions for this class of plane contact problems under partial reverse slip conditions, when bulk stress is applied. A general shear traction distribution based on boundary conditions and the direction of slip in slip zone has been proposed to obtain closed form solution for this problem. To obtain the closed form solution for specific problem of flat base in contact with a nominally flat punch, pressure distribution had to be approximated to evaluate some integrals. An appropriate approximation valid for all ratios of <b>flat</b> <b>length</b> to edge radii has been proposed. Deviations in shear traction distribution due to this approximation {{was found to be}} very small. For sake of brevity, loading case of only bulk stress applied is presented...|$|R

We reassemble Operator Equalisation by joining these two ingredients in a hybrid method, and test it in a hard real world regression problem. The re-sults are surprising. Operator Equalisation and the hybrid variants exhibit completely different behaviors, and an unexpected feature of Operator Equalisation is revealed, one that may be the true re-sponsible for its success: a nearly <b>flat</b> <b>length</b> distribution target.

40|$|A {{hybrid model}} for the {{prediction}} of ground-borne vibration due to discrete wheel and rail irregularities, such as wheel flats, dipped welds and insulated rail joints, is presented. The hybrid model combines the simulation of vertical wheel-rail contact force in the time domain, accounting for parametric excitation due to sleeper periodicity and impact excitation induced by loss of wheel-rail contact, and calculation of ground-borne vibration in the frequency-wavenumber domain considering a layered soil model. The model is demonstrated by investigating the influence of wheel flat size and vehicle speed on maximum vertical wheel-rail contact force and free field ground vibration. It is shown that magnitudes of impact load and ground vibration are increasing with increasing wheel <b>flat</b> <b>length</b> (and depth), but the influence of vehicle speed is not as evident. Higher vehicle speeds often lead to loss of wheel-rail contact and severe impact loads but the frequency content of such impact loads is shifted to higher frequencies which may be less significant for ground vibration...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presents}} {{research of}} defective railway wheel and rail dynamics and mathematical model of system “Railway vehicle wheel – track”. An assumption {{was made that}} the Rail R– 65 and railway wheel with flats are with unevenness. The aim of this investigation is to identify the contact forces resulting from the wheel/rail contact at the various defects. Rail track dynamics is described by finite element method, while soil and wagon dynamics is described by the discrete elements. The mathematical model is to assess physical and mechanical properties, roughness of wheel and rail surface, and their geometry. In the mathematical model of the rail is evaluated: the impact of axial force, the initial deformation of rail, the foundation of soil, the gap between sleeper and rail. Profile of railway wheel {{is defined as a}} function of radius variable depending on the polar angle and described by Fourier series. In this mathematical model of railway wheel and rail contact area is divided into small sections, where the force is set in contact using the Hertz theory. Total system of non-linear equations of motion is solved by applying the Newton-Raphson method. The speed of the train is 100 km/h and static load on the rail is 100 kN.

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation method for investigating the form generation mechanism in the centerless grinding process is described. In this work, instantaneous {{change of the}} apparent depth of cut during grinding was modeled using absolute coordinate systems. The result of the simulation was not affected by the coordinate system (the location of the reference circle center and the radius of the reference circle). Also, analytical models of the interference phenomena at the contact points were developed to investigate their effects on the roundness profile of a centerless ground workpiece. In order to {{study the effects of}} grinding variables on grinding mechanism, details of the machining factor were formulated using such process variables as grinding wheel speed, wheel specification, regulating wheel speed, dressing condition, etc. A least squares contact line was formulated to include the effect of workpiece orientation relative to the grinding machine. Using these formulas, 2 -D, 3 -D infeed, and 3 -D through-feed centerless grinding simulation models were developed. For the 3 -D through-feed simulation model, grinding forces of previous and/or following workpieces were assumed {{as a function of the}} current workpiece location. ^ The experiments and {{computer simulation}}s were carried out using three types of cylindrical workpiece shapes with varying <b>flat</b> <b>length.</b> To validate these models, simulation results were compared with the experimental results. It was found that the number of lobes and the angular displacement of peaks and corresponding valleys of the simulation results were identical with those of the roundness profiles of ground workpieces. Through 2 -D simulation, it was verified that grinding wheel interference is affected not only by geometry but also by machine elasticity. 3 -D simulation results revealed that the effect of flat end is propagated to the opposite end through workpiece reorientation. It was shown that the inherent tapering error of the through-feed centerless grinding exists. The effects of the center height angle (β), the number of workpiece rotations, the regulating wheel tilt angle (φ), and the slope of the grinding wheel inlet crown on the geometric tolerance of a cylindrically centerless ground workpiece were investigated. ...|$|R
