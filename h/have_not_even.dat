5|$|Boron is {{a special}} case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, {{involving}} appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700°C, but sodium at 900°C and potassium not until 1200°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> been characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB10, NaB6, NaB15, and KB6. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions {{like the rest of}} group 13.|$|E

25|$|While {{the series}} {{was funded by the}} Australian Government, the authors were free to write on all topics other than {{technical}} secrets which were classified at the time and were not otherwise censored. In line with a request by the US and British governments, the official historians in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the US were not given access to Ultra intelligence gained from decrypting German codes. The vetting process for the volumes in the various series also sought to ensure that they did not disclose that German codes had been broken, as this was still classified at the time. Long may <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> been informed that German or Japanese codes had been broken. The authors were given unrestricted access to all other official records, and the Army, Navy and Air series were mainly based on these records and the hundreds of interviews Long had conducted with Australian military personnel during the war. German, Italian and Japanese records were also used to provide information on the enemies the Australian military fought. Draft chapters were sent for comment to the official historians in Britain, New Zealand and the United States.|$|E
500|$|From the {{experience}} of growing up within two cultures Cisneros was able to combine both ethnicities, and in her stories she develops a major theme of hybridity between the American and Mexican cultures. [...] She draws upon her life experience as she [...] "depicts {{the situation of the}} Mexican-American woman: typically caught between two cultures, she resides in a cultural borderland. The topics of the stories range from the confusions of a bicultural and bilingual childhood to the struggles of a dark-skinned woman to recognize her own beauty in the land of Barbie dolls and blond beauty queens." [...] Because these issues are complex, Cisneros does not try to resolve all of them. Instead, she attempts to find neutral ground where the characters can try to meld their Mexican heritage with an American lifestyle, without feeling homesick for a country which, in some cases, the women <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> experienced.|$|E

In his diary, Gordon wrote: [...] "I own to having been very insubordinate to Her Majesty's Government and its officials, but it is my nature, and I cannot help it.

There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, but we <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places.

2500|$|The Arakan Campaign, {{which began}} in December 1942, {{conducted}} by what {{at the time was}} an improvised formation 14th Indian Infantry Division was a failure. The average British and Indian soldier was not properly trained for fighting in jungle, which together with repeated defeats adversely affected morale. This was exacerbated by poor administration in the rear areas. Drafts of reinforcements sent to replace casualties were found in some cases to <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> completed basic training. There were also questions asked about the ability of the Indian Army's high command, which {{led to the creation of}} the position of Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command, leaving the army high command to concentrate on internal security and administration. There was continual patrol activity and low-key fighting south of Imphal, but neither army possessed the resources to mount decisive operations. 17th Division held positions around the town of Tiddim [...] south of Imphal, and skirmished with units of the 33rd Japanese Division. The Japanese had a shorter and easier supply line from the port of Kalewa on the Chindwin River and had the upper hand for most of 1942 and 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The Flatiron Building {{has become}} an icon of New York City, and the public {{response}} to it was enthusiastic, but the critical response to {{it at the time}} was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. Montgomery Schuyler, editor of Architectural Record, said that its [...] "awkwardness [...] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation." [...] He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: [...] " [...] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close {{in front of him and}} close behind him and close on one side of him.

2500|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Normal School of Science, Wells was {{left without a}} source of income. His aunt Mary—his father's sister-in-law—invited him {{to stay with her}} for a while, which solved his {{immediate}} problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel. He would later go on to court her. To earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as The Pall Mall Gazette, later collecting these in volume form as Select Conversations with an Uncle (1895) and Certain Personal Matters (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C Smith, [...] "Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so ... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It obvious that many early Wells items have been lost." [...] His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, The Time Machine, in 1895.|$|E

2500|$|Both the Georgian Dream {{opposition}} and Georgia's then-ruling party United National Movement have postponed earlier planned mass actions {{related to the}} upcoming parliamentary election due {{to the death of}} Georgian citizens. At a rally on September 9, Bidzina Ivanishvili, the leader of the Georgian Dream, accused the government of [...] "insolently lying" [...] about the operation and said that [...] "tragedy" [...] of Lopota would be investigated and those responsible punished, adding, [...] "Georgian troops died there; Georgian citizens, Kists died there and North Caucasians died there too. This is not a Georgian dream; this can’t be a Georgian dream." [...] At his own rally on the same day, Saakashvili said about [...] "a very dangerous military provocation in the Lopota Gorge" [...] related to an alleged greater Russian plot to [...] "give them [...] a pretext to use our internal disorders and internal divide for implementation of their sinister plans" [...] and charged that his opponents who are [...] "weeping today for the fate of terrorists and <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> utter a word about our [...] who died, knew very well what this provocation was about; what this mess was all about."

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, in 1562, Marroquin left in {{his will}} some funds to set up a school, the Santo Tomás de Aquino, where [...] Grammar, Arts, Philosophy and Theology would be taught. The {{beneficiaries}} of this pious enterprise would be the children of poor Spaniards, given that they could not travel to cities (like Mexico) where the Royal Universities were. This will has been also interpreted by scholars as the origin of the University of San Carlos. However, the late priest had a clear idea of the difference between a school (i.e., a home for students, with or without classes) and a university (or General Study) where the students earned degrees. About this, historian John Tate Lanning tells that [...] "his will is so well known that there are some scholars that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> seen it and have already read {{a lot of things that}} are not there at all. Nowhere in his will Marroquín talks about any university, much less talk about his intentions to establish one..." [...] On the other hand, what is documented is that major Pedro Crespo Suárez left in his will twenty thousand pesos to set up the classes for the university that is [...] "in the works with the authorities".|$|E
