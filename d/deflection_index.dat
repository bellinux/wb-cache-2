A {{comparative}} study of the girder damage identification of Jintang Cable-stayed Bridge in Zhoushan Island-Land Project using the <b>deflection</b> <b>index,</b> the cable tension index, the beam bottom bending stress index, the modal curvature index and the modal flexibility matrix is introduced. By means of finite element method, a series of damage cases associated with the box girder are analyzed. The result shows that, for different damage types, the best effect of the girder damage identification is the modal curvature index, followed by the cable tension index, the beam bottom bending stress index is nearly of the same effect as the modal flexibility matrix index, and the worst is the <b>deflection</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

He had undergone prior catheter ablation for VT three years ago. During the prior attempt he underwent voltage guided substrate ablation. With programmed ventricular extrastimulation (PVES), PMVT was repeatedly induced requiring DC shock. Intravenous procainamide was administered and PVES was repeated which induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT). This VT had pseudo delta waves with maximum <b>deflection</b> <b>index</b> of 0. 68, suggestive of epicardial origin. Activation mapping was performed epicardially. Presystolic potentials were recorded in mid anterolateral wall of left ventricular epicardial region. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation at this site terminated the VT.

40|$|Background: Several {{previous}} {{reports have}} revealed that idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), including premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and ventricular tachycardias (IVTs), can originate from endocardial mitral annulus (ENDO MA). However, these data are limited to ENDO MA VAs, and {{little is known about}} the electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics and the efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) via the coronary venous system for the VAs arising from the epicardial MA (EPI MA). Methodology/Principal Findings: Characteristics of body surface electrocardiogram and electrophysiologic recordings were analyzed in 21 patients with symptomatic PVCs/IVTs originating from the vicinity of MA. Among 597 patients with PVCs/IVTs, the incidence of VAs originating from the ENDO and EPI MA was 3. 52 % (21 cases). Eleven (52 %) from the ENDO MA, and 10 (48 %) from the EPI MA. There were different characteristics of ECG of PVCs/VT originating from the ENDO and EPI MA. The prolonged pseudodelta wave time and intrinsicoid deflection time in lead V 2 and the precordial maximum <b>deflection</b> <b>index</b> reliably differentiated EPI MA VAs from ENDO MA VAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Successful RFCA in 18 patients could be achieved (85. 7 % acute procedural success). Conclusions/Significance: ECG characteristics of PVCs/VTs originating from the different portions of the MA are different, and can help regionalize the origin of these arrhythmias. RFCA within the coronary venous system was relatively effectiv...|$|E

40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of a road decreases greatly during spring thaw, when the previously frozen road begins to thaw. The extent of this decrease can be evaluated by making Falling Weight Deflectomter (FWD) measurements on the road, measuring the deflection of the road when an impact load is applied to it. The {{bearing capacity}} of the road can then be evaluated by backcalculating the layer modules with backcalculation programs, or through more simple calculations based on the <b>deflection</b> basin <b>indices.</b> Both analyses were carried out in this thesis with data from FWD measurements which were carried out on county road Lv 126 in Southern Sweden during the year 2010. The temperature and moisture content of the road were monitored during the same time. The aim with the thesis was to compare the two ways of analyses, {{and to find out}} if there is some relationship between them and the measured environmental data. The results showed that the base course layer and subbase decreased in stiffness during spring thaw about 50 % while the decrease in the subgrade was 20 %, compared to the backcalculated summer and autumn value. The results of the simple calculations from the <b>deflection</b> basin <b>indices</b> were well comparable to the backcalculation results. By comparing the backcalculated stiffness values to the moisture content measurements it was stated that the stiffness decreased as the moisture content increased. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Percutaneous pericardial {{access for}} {{epicardial}} mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias has expanded considerably in recent years. After its description {{in patients with}} Chagas disease, the technique has provided relevant in-formation on the arrhythmia substrate in other cardiomyopathies and has improved the results of ablation procedures in various clinical settings. Electrocardiographic criteria proposed for {{the recognition of the}} epicardial origin of ventricular tachycardias are mainly based on analysis of the first QRS components. Ventricular activation at the epicardium has a slow initial component reflecting the transmural activation and influenced by the absence of Purkinje system in the epicardium. Various parameters (pseudodelta wave, intrinsicoid deflection and shortest RS interval) of these initial inter-vals predict an epicardial origin in patients with scar-related ventricular tachycardias with right bundle branch block mor-phology. Using the same concept, the maximum <b>deflection</b> <b>index</b> was defined for the location of idiopathic epicardial tachycardias remote from the aortic root. Electrocardiogram criteria based on the morphology of the first component of the QRS (q wave in lead I) have been proposed in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. All these criteria seem to be substrate-specific and have several limitations. Other information, including type of underlying heart disease, previous failed endocardial ablation, and evidence of epicardial scar on magnetic resonance imaging, can help to plan the ablation procedure and decide on an epicardial approach...|$|E

The capacity to better match root systems to {{the environment in which}} they grow offers the potential to improve crop productivity. In this study, the ROOTMAP model of crop root growth was used to screen combinations of rooting traits and cropping environments, to identify rooting characteristics important for crop productivity. This study focussed on grain crops growing as perfect weed-free monocultures or in competition with weeds. A sensitivity analysis approach was used to investigate 30 parameters that describe root architecture, the cropping environment and agronomic management. Parameters were ranked in order of importance for water, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. Parameters controlling the efficient distribution of roots through soil (geotropism index, <b>deflection</b> <b>index,</b> branch angle), and physiological parameters determining the rate of phosphate influx into roots (P uptake kinetics), ranked highest for weed-free crops. In contrast, the most important parameters for plants in competition with weeds were those controlling the intensity of soil foraging (plant density and branch spacing) and rate of root system establishment (relative root growth rate), highlighting the importance of quickly and effectively occupying the soil volume during establishment if a crop is to out-compete weeds. This separation of characteristics into those of greatest benefit to weed-free crops or in crop-weed competition, suggests that there is the potential for tailoring root characteristics to specific conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Microcantilevers are {{the basic}} and {{fundamental}} MEMS based structures used in microsystems. Microcantilevers have been used both as sensors and actuators. In this paper, modeling and simulation details of a microcantilever for thermal actuation are presented. The advantage of this actuator is, the tip of this actuator which actually drives some other object doesn’t gets heated and hence {{can be used in}} any environment safely. The main objective of this work is to investigate the nature of deflection of microcantilever based actuator for the applied potential difference across the base pads. In this device, two microcantilevers of different dimensions are considered and when these are subjected to same current, deflect differently. The current density in the thin arm is greater than the current density in the thick arm. Therefore, the thin arm heats up more than the thick arm, which makes the thin arm to bend. Thus, temperature produces thermal strain and thermally induced deflections. This turns the microstructure into a thermal actuator. The amount of tip deflection is a direct function of the applied potential difference between the electrical connection pads. Therefore, the amount of tip deflection can be calibrated as a function of applied voltage. Additional objectives of this work are to obtain voltage, temperature and displacement plots. Increasing the applied voltage in the model developed in ANSYS/Multiphysics, resulted in increase in the deflection. This is because of direct relationship between the applied voltage, current density, temperature developed and <b>deflection.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Microcantilever, thermal microactuator, FEM Analysis, ANSYS / Multiphysics, MEM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with all-optical networks using deflection routing and time division multiplexing. Slotted networks {{make use of the}} synchronous arrival of the packets to the routers to minimize locally the number of deflections. In this paper, we show that the difference in performances between slotted and unslotted networks is mainly {{due to the fact that}} unslotted networks cannot easily perform such local optimization. We also show that minimizing locally the number of deflections in unslotted networks gives rise to an NP-complete problem. To overcome this problem, we have designed a heuristic whose aim is to limit locally the number of deflections. We experimentally demonstrate that this heuristic enhances unslotted routing almost at the same performance level as slotted routing. As a consequence, we have shown that unslotted deflection routing can be implemented is a way which makes it a competitive alternative to slotted deflection routing for optical time division multiplexing <b>deflection</b> networks. <b>Index</b> Terms—All-optical networks, <b>deflection</b> routing, slotted versus unslotted networks.

If downward reactions cannot be developed at the supports, the corners will be lifted up. By providing torsion reinforcement, corners are usually prevented from being lifted up. In such cases the corners have to be suitably reinforced at top and also at bottom otherwise cracks are liable to be formed at the corners. The present investigation is intended to study the influence of torsion reinforcement in reinforced concrete slab with end condition all ends discontinuous under uniformly distributed load. Slabs with torsion reinforcement varying from 20 % to 35 % were casted and tested. Increasing in the torsion reinforcement controls the deflection of the slab element.

Moreover, the presented framework uses a simulation approach to investigate the effectiveness of the determined setting of controllable factors obtained from statistical analysis, for optimization of sink mark <b>index,</b> <b>deflection</b> rate and volumetric shrinkage in plastic molding manufacturing processes.

The 85 thermal power stations in India generate a huge quantity of Fly ash every year (140 million tonnes per year) as a by-product almost matching the annual production of cement. The dumping of Fly ash in open fields results in ecological and environmental problems. In such a situation, three factors – environmental protection, energy savings and the inherent advantages arising {{from the use of}} Fly ash demand that the construction industry examine closely the implication of the incorporation of Fly ash in concrete construction. Thus, there is worldwide interest in Fly ash utilization in concrete and this is reflected in the development currently taking place in the concrete industry. Hence, this paper present the investigation of comparison between the flexural behaviour of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with that of reinforced normal concrete beams and increase the confidence levels of designers and other beneficiaries in using reinforced Fly ash concrete as a structural material. The flexural behaviour of reinforced Fly ash concrete beams with different cement replacement levels (20 %, 35 % and 50 %) are compared with reinforced normal concrete beams (with out containing Fly ash) under similar conditions. These investigations were conducted with three grades of concrete i. e. M 30, M 40 and M 50. Deflection is one of the important serviceability limit states to be satisfied in the design of concrete structures. So the flexural behaviour of these beams is discussed in terms of load <b>deflection</b> behavior. <b>Index</b> Terms — Fly ash, cement replacement material, concret...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{overburden}} geology must {{be considered}} in applying subsidence prediction methodologies developed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM). To characterize rock mass overlying high-extraction coal mines, the USBM utilizes a computer spreadsheet program and modified Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system. The spreadsheet calculates an RMR based on a bed's engineering properties determined from core logs and laboratory tests. An in situ deformation modulus and a bending stiffness are computed for each bed. Stiffness-versus-depth plots identify groups of beds with similar stiffness. Large variations in stiffness between adjacent beds are considered significant horizontal discontinuities where slip is likely. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is used to verify this hypothesis by measuring shear displacement along such discontinuities. A model of the overburden is built by assuming that a near-surface laminated beam exists above a transition zone in which large plastic slip occurs along horizontal discontinuities. Increasingly thicker groups of beds are modeled to determine the most probable beam thickness based on a comparison with measured deflection profiles. The inverse of maximum beam <b>deflection</b> is an <b>index</b> parameter known as "bridging potential," a single value that incorporates both overburden geology and mine geometry...|$|R
40|$|During the spring, as {{the average}} daily air {{temperature}} and declination of the sun increases, so does {{the temperature of the}} asphalt surface layer. As the increase in temperature travels through the surface layer and reaches the unbound aggregate base layer, the saturated base layer begins to thaw. For a flexible pavement with a fine-grained subgrade, the moisture in the base becomes trapped between the impermeable asphalt concrete layer and the frozen, fine-grained subgrade. The excess water requires {{a long period of time}} to properly drain. During this period, the subgrade becomes considerably softer and decreases in stiffness, and the roadway experiences an increase in damage and reduction in service life. The duration of thaw for a typical pavement structure depends on soil type, moisture and thermal properties, air temperature, solar radiation, drainage and the location of the site. Spring load restrictions are applied to protect weak pavement structures that would otherwise experience excessive deflections. Nearly 58 % of the Manitoba Provincial pavement network is subjected to spring load restrictions, and most of these roads consist of a thin flexible pavement or an asphalt surface treatment.

A total of thirty six specimens were designed with different amounts of reinforcement with three types of reinforcing bars (i. e., helically wrapped GFRP, sand-coated surface GFRP and steel). Eighteen specimens were subjected to sustained loads and accelerated aging conditions (i. e., 47 °C and 80 % relative humidity) in a chamber. The flexural behavior of specimens under 300 -day exposure was {{compared to that of}} the companion specimens without experiencing accelerated aging conditions. Results indicate that the accelerated aging conditions reduced flexural capacity in not only RC-steel, but also RC-GFRP specimens, with different rates of reduction. Different types of GFRP reinforcement exhibited different rates of degradation of the flexural capacity when embedded in concrete under the same exposure conditions. Several existing models were compared with experimental results for predicting the <b>deflection</b> and deformability <b>index</b> for specimens.

Three concrete beam types were produced, plain, steel reinforced and fibre reinforced, and a comparative study was undertaken of post crack flexural toughness. The procedure used was to manufacture steel A 142 fabric and macro fibre reinforced concrete beams to provide load, <b>deflection</b> data, toughness <b>indices</b> and was compliant with, ASTM C 1018 - 97, [ASTM, 1997] using a three point loading arrangement.

40|$|Calcium carbide residue (CCR) is a {{by-product}} of acetylene gas production. Stockpiles of CCR continue to accumulate worldwide, in both developed and developing countries. Sustainable reuse options for CCR in civil infrastructures, such as road embankments, have been recently evaluated in the laboratory. However, to date there are limited studies on the actual field performance of CCR in stabilizing clayey soils in highway subgrades. In this study, a field trial was conducted to ascertain the viability of using CCR stabilized clayey soil as a highway subgrade course material. Quicklime was selected as a control binder in the field trial for comparison purposes. The construction procedures of the CCR and quicklime stabilizations in two field sections are presented. A series of field tests, including California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test, plate loading test, Benkelman beam deflection test, and dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test were undertaken after the embankment construction. The results indicated that in the top zone of the filled soil layers with 94 % degree of compaction, the CCR stabilized subgrade soil exhibited higher values of CBR and resilient modulus, and lower values of resilient <b>deflection</b> and DCP <b>Index</b> relative to the quicklime stabilized soil.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory {{crack control reinforcement}} and compare the findings against steel fabric used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, <b>deflection</b> data, toughness <b>indices</b> and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 steel fabric reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. Steel fabric tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with steel fabric. Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the floor screed companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate.

40|$|Fracture and {{breakage}} {{of single}} crystals, particularly of silicon wafers, are multi-scale problems: the crack tip starts propagating on an atomic scale with {{the breaking of}} chemical bonds, forms crack fronts through the crystal on the micrometre scale and ends macroscopically in catastrophic wafer shattering. Total wafer breakage is a severe problem for the semiconductor industry, not only during handling but also during temperature treatments, leading to million-dollar costs per annum in a device production line. Knowledge of the relevant dynamics governing perfect cleavage along the { 111 } or { 110 } faces, and of the <b>deflection</b> into higher <b>indexed</b> {hkl} faces of higher energy, is scarce due to the high velocity of the process. Imaging techniques are commonly limited to depicting only the state of a wafer before the crack and in the final state. This paper presents, for the first time, in situ high-speed crack propagation under thermal stress, imaged simultaneously in direct transmission and diffraction X-ray imaging. It shows how the propagating crack tip and the related strain field can be tracked in the phase-contrast and diffracted images, respectively. Movies with a time resolution of microseconds per frame reveal that the strain and crack tip do not propagate continuously or at a constant speed. Jumps in the crack tip position indicate pinning of the crack tip for about 1 – 2  ms followed by jumps faster than 2 – 6  m s− 1, leading to a macroscopically observed average velocity of 0. 028 – 0. 055  m s− 1.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{theoretical}} and experimental results of integrated optical (IO) cavities defined by grated waveguides in Si 3 N 4 and Si, for the accurate detection of cantilever <b>deflection</b> and bulk <b>index</b> changes. Microcantilever-based {{sensors can be}} used to detect molecular adsorption, which causes changes in the surface stress [1], leading to deflection of the cantilever. We propose a novel and highly sensitive integrated read-out scheme to detect small deflections of a cantilever in close proximity to a grated waveguide structure. It is well-known that a partly grated waveguide defines a cavity in the grated region for wavelengths outside the stopband. In particular, for wavelengths next to the stopband sharp spectral features can be observed, which are related to the strong dispersion in that wavelength region. A cantilever, if placed in the evanescent field region of the grated waveguide, will lead to the occurrence of propagating modes for wavelengths inside the stopband, and so to resonances inside the stopband, as shown in fig. 1. As {{can be seen from the}} figure, on decreasing the gap between grating and cantilever the first near band-edge resonance peak is pulled inside the stopband; simultaneously its spectral width goes down. This effect can be used for the detection of cantilever displacements. Assuming that a peak shift can be detected with a resolution δλ of 0. 001 times its spectral width, it follows from fig. 1 that a displacement of (/) (50 / 2) 0. 2 pm 5 pmg gδ λ δλ = ∂ ∂ = = can be detected with the considered compact device having a length of only 98 μm.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical and experimental development of a new technique for the measurement of the refractive-index profile in an optical fibre preform. The refractive-index profile {{is one of the most}} important parameters in designing optical fibres for communication systems. It is of critical importance to signal bandwidth of the the fibre. Therefore, a close control of the index profile and its accurate measurement are necessary. In particular, quality control of preforms from which the fibres are drawn demands a nondestructive method which is able to reveal the accurate and detailed index profile of both single-mode and multimode fibre preforms. In our method, a light beam illuminates a preform transversely and the preform image is produced on a screen. We have found that various forms of the spatial filtering technique may be used to acquire the information required for the index-profile determination. Equivalently, we measure the light deflection suffered by geometric rays traversing the preform, i. e. the <b>deflection</b> function. The <b>index</b> profile is calculated from the deflection function through a mathematical transform. An investigation of the optical phenomena involved and a formulation of the index-profile transform is presented as a background study for the project. Two of the spatial filtering techniques are found to be of particular importance for the development of automatic index-profiling apparatus, namely (a) the angled knife-edge method and (b) the chopper method. The former produces a visual image of the deflection function and the latter provides the deflection function in the form of a time-varying signal. The index profiling apparatus has been designed and constructed for use in routine preform inspection. An analysis of the method is made and shows that the method requires no critical alignment, is accurate and has high resolution. However, the method requires the preform to be circularly symmetric for accurate results. In order to obtain an accurate index profile of a noncircular preform, a new method is presented, in which the light refraction at a preform endface is used. The method reveals the three-dimensional image of the index profile directly without the need for any calculation or further processing...|$|R
