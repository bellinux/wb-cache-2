5|$|At Illinois, Corbally {{replaced}} David D. Henry, who stated he was {{stepping down}} {{in favor of}} a younger president with <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas.</b> Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then the ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus.|$|E

25|$|Some {{attempts}} were made to create pure comic magazines. One of these was Tábortűz (1957–1965), another magazine for Pioneers, based on the French Camera 34 and full of <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas.</b> Although it did not meet the Pioneer Association's ideas and ordered the editorial to drastically reduce the number of comic pages in the magazine.|$|E

50|$|In early 1994, Marsh {{introduced}} a card-based customer loyalty program called the Marsh <b>Fresh</b> <b>IDEA</b> (Instant Discounts Electronically Applied) Card in which discounts are sometimes {{based on the}} cardholder's buying habits and are issued immediately for current purchases or as coupons for future visits. The first print mention of this program was in the April 1994 issue of the Indianapolis Recorder and the program was rolled to other marketing areas by November of the same year. In conjunction with this program, Marsh became the first supermarket chain {{in the region to}} offer a co-branded Visa card the following year.

25|$|After the 1964 National Assembly {{election}} in March, a crisis occurred that left Somalia without a government until {{the beginning of}} September. President Osman, who was empowered to propose the candidate for prime minister after an election or the fall of a government, chose Abdirizak Haji Hussein as his nominee instead of the incumbent, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who had the endorsement of the SYL party leadership. Shermarke had been prime minister for the four previous years, and Osman decided that new leadership might be able to introduce <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> for solving national problems.|$|E
25|$|Victoria {{soon had}} a larger {{population}} than New South Wales, and its upstart capital, Melbourne, outgrew Sydney. But the New South Wales gold fields also attracted {{a flood of}} prospectors, and by 1857 the colony had more than 300,000 people. Inland towns like Bathurst, Goulburn, Orange and Young flourished. Gold brought great wealth but also new social tensions. Multiethnic migrants came to New South Wales in large numbers for the first time. Young became {{the site of an}} infamous anti-Chinese miner riot in 1861 and the official Riot Act was read to the miners on 14 July – the only official reading in the history of New South Wales. Despite some tension, the influx of migrants also brought <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> from Europe and North America to New South Wales – Norwegians introduced Skiing in Australia to the hills above the Snowy Mountains gold rush town of Kiandra around 1861. A famous Australian son was also born to a Norwegian miner in 1867, when the bush balladeer Henry Lawson was born at the Grenfell goldfields.|$|E

There was so much racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters had black paint all over them with racial epithets. It was very disturbing.|$|E

Jean said that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas.</b> People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] In April 2001, in an interview with The New York Times, Jean stated that he wanted [...] "to take the show back to the family".|$|E
500|$|Conrad Hall was not {{the first}} choice for {{director}} of photography; Mendes believed he was [...] "too old and too experienced" [...] to want the job, and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with. Instead, Mendes asked Fred Elmes, who turned the job down because he did not like the script. Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise, because of Hall's work on Without Limits(1998), which Cruise had executive produced. Mendes was directing Cruise's then-wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during preproduction on American Beauty, and had already storyboarded the whole film. Hall was involved for one month during preproduction; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script, and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting Mendes. Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals, which gave him <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> on his approach to the visuals.|$|E

40|$|The {{crowd is}} {{emerging}} as {{a new source of}} innovation, and here a new way of organizing the crowd to produce new ideas is discussed: an idea generation system using combination in which participants synthesize new designs from the efforts of their peers. A crowd generates designs; then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs are compared to the initial designs, and to a control condition in which <b>fresh</b> <b>idea</b> generation rather than combination is used. The results show that designs become more creative in later generations of the combination system, and the combination produces more creative <b>ideas</b> than the <b>fresh</b> <b>idea</b> generation. The model of crowdsourced idea generation discussed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied {{to a wide range of}} design problems. The work has pragmatic implications, and also theoretical implications: new forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to build and test existing and emerging theories of coordination and design...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{translation}} {{and implementation of}} Smart Specialisation in Wales. It finds that rather than taking {{a new approach to}} innovation policy, Welsh policy-makers are following a largely cluster-based rationale, which omits the important entrepreneurial discovery process to identify the real strengths of the region. The <b>fresh</b> <b>idea</b> presented by this paper is that a replication of past policy approaches that have been tried and found wanting is taking place rather than a new approach to innovation policy across Europe...|$|R
500|$|GamePro {{also gave}} Super Mario Sunshine a perfect score, {{stating that the}} game was [...] "a {{masterpiece}} of superior game design, infinite gameplay variety, creativity, and life." [...] The American-based publication Game Informer said that the game is arguably [...] "the best Mario game to date." [...] Computer and Video Games also mentioned the game is [...] "better than Super Mario 64." [...] The game placed 46th in Official Nintendo Magazines 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time. Allgame gave a lower review, stating that [...] "During the six-year span between Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine, platform games have become more epic, more interactive, and prettier. Yet the core element of collecting items in a world divided into sub-sections has been left unchanged. So {{it comes with a}} modicum of disappointment that Super Mario Sunshine doesn't shake up the genre with a number of new and <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> other than the usual enhancements expected from a sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarmiento's {{book is a}} {{critique}} and also a symptom of Argentina's cultural conflicts. [...] In 1810, the country had gained independence from the Spanish Empire, but Sarmiento complains that Argentina had yet to cohere as a unified entity. [...] The country's chief political division saw the Unitarists (or Unitarians, with whom Sarmiento sided), who favored centralization, counterposed against the Federalists, who believed that the regions should maintain a good measure of autonomy. This division was in part a split between {{the city and the}} countryside. [...] Then as now, Buenos Aires was the country’s largest and wealthiest city {{as a result of its}} access to river trade routes and the South Atlantic. Buenos Aires was exposed not only to trade but to <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> and European culture. These economic and cultural differences caused tension between Buenos Aires and the land-locked regions of the country. [...] Despite his Unitarian sympathies, Sarmiento himself came from the provinces, a native of the Western town of San Juan.|$|E
500|$|Within the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which {{administered}} English cricket at the time, few {{voices were}} more influential than [...] "Plum" [...] Warner's, who, when considering England's response to Bradman, wrote that it [...] "must evolve {{a new type}} of bowler and develop <b>fresh</b> <b>ideas</b> and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill". To that end, Warner orchestrated the appointment of Douglas Jardine as England captain in 1931, as a prelude to Jardine leading the 1932–33 tour to Australia, with Warner as team manager. Remembering that Bradman had struggled against bouncers during his 232 at The Oval in 1930, Jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short-pitched bowling to combat Bradman. He settled on the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics. In support, the England selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad. The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused Bradman's own suspicions.|$|E
