25|$|Large {{differences}} in spatial impairment are {{found among the}} dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Lesions to the ventral hippocampus {{have no effect on}} spatial memory, while the dorsal hippocampus is required for retrieval, processing short-term memory and transferring memory from the short term to longer delay periods. Infusion of amphetamine into the dorsal hippocampus has also been shown to <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> for spatial locations learned previously. These findings indicate that there is a functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|A {{few studies}} have even found that emotionally arousing stimuli <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> only after a delay. The most famous of these was a study by Kleinsmith and Kaplan (1963) that found an {{advantage}} for numbers paired with arousing words over those paired with neutral words only at delayed test, but not at immediate test. As outlined by Mather (2007), the Kleinsmith and Kaplan effects were most likely due to a methodological confound. However, Sharot and Phelps (2004) found better recognition of arousing words over neutral words at a delayed test but not at an immediate test, supporting {{the notion that there}} is enhanced memory consolidation for arousing stimuli. According to these theories, different physiological systems, including those involved in the discharge of hormones believed to affect memory consolidation, become active during, and closely following, the occurrence of arousing events.|$|E

2500|$|Artificially {{inducing}} this instinct through traumatic {{physical or}} emotional stimuli essentially creates the same physiological condition that heightens memory retention by exciting neuro-chemical activity affecting {{areas of the}} brain responsible for encoding and recalling memory.

2500|$|In {{psychology}} {{there is}} a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend {{to dwell on the}} negative more than the positive. Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> for material that follows them,” (Newhagen & Reeves, 1992, p.25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material? ...|$|E
2500|$|Odor {{recognition}} {{is the most}} common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor recognition test participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. [...] More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a delay period is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) {{is the same as the}} one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition decisions that are made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> for olfactory stimuli. [...] There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for perceptual information as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels.|$|E

25|$|In {{tests with}} rats, lesions to their Basolateral Amygdala {{were shown to}} block the <b>memory</b> <b>enhancing</b> effects of glucocorticoids. Likewise, so did infusions of β-receptor ant{{agonists}} after training. Infusions of β-receptor agonists then, unsurprisingly <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation.

2500|$|Glucocorticoids {{have also}} been shown to have a {{significant}} impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). This appears to follow the Yerkes-Dodson curve, as studies have shown circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down U pattern, much like the Yerkes-Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low-GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-GC state). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. In contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these stress hormones have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as [...] "steroid dementia." ...|$|E

Extending this research, the present study examined the effects of a fairness instruction on the encoding of stereotype-inconsistent information compared to stereotype-consistent information. It was found that participants who were instructed to avoid stereotypic judgments showed <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for stereotype-consistent as well as for stereotype-inconsistent information.

50|$|Recent {{research}} findings by Rawson and Dunlosky (2012) provide an alternate hypothesis of memory enhancement.

50|$|Acute {{stress is}} a {{stressor}} {{that is an}} immediate perceived threat. Unlike chronic stress, acute stress is not ongoing and the physiological arousal associated with acute stress {{is not nearly as}} demanding. There are mixed findings on the effects of acute stress on memory. One view is that acute stress can impair memory, while others believe that acute stress can actually <b>enhance</b> <b>memory.</b> Several studies have shown that stress and glucocorticoids <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> formation while they impair memory retrieval. For acute stress to <b>enhance</b> <b>memory</b> certain circumstances must be met. First, {{the context in which the}} stress is being perceived must match the context of the information or material being encoded. Second, the brain regions involved in the retrieval of the memory must match the regions targeted by glucocorticoids. There are also differences in the type of information being remembered or being forgotten while being exposed to acute stress. In some cases neutral stimuli tend to be remembered, while emotionally charged (salient) stimuli tend to be forgotten. In other cases the opposite effect is obtained. What seems to be an important factor in determining what will be impaired and what will be enhanced is the timing of the perceived stressful exposure and the timing of the retrieval. For emotionally salient information to be remembered, the perceived stress must be induced before encoding, and retrieval must follow shortly afterwards. In contrast, for emotionally charged stimuli to be forgotten, the stressful exposure must be after encoding and retrieval must follow after a longer delay.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comThe evolution of reciprocal altruism probably involved the evolution of mechanisms to detect cheating and remember cheaters. In a well-known study, Mealey, Daood, and Krage (1996) observed that participants had <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for faces {{that had previously been}} associated with descriptions of acts of cheating. There were, however, problems with the descriptions that were used in that study. We sought to replicate and extend the findings of Mealey and colleagues by using more controlled descriptions and by examining the possibility of enhanced altruist recognition. We also examined whether individual differences in cheating tendencies were related to cheater and altruist recognition. In the first experiment, 164 undergraduates saw 40 faces that were paired with character descriptions representing the categories of cheater, trustworthy, altruist, or neutral, for individuals who had either low or high social status. One week later participants reported which faces they recognized from the previous week (among 80 faces). Overall, the results failed to replicate the findings of Mealey and her colleagues, as there was no <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for cheaters. In addition, there was no <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for altruists, and no effect of participants’ cheating tendencies.

40|$|Emotions {{influence}} {{attention and}} {{processes involved in}} memory. Although some {{research has suggested that}} positive affect categorically influences these processes differently than neutral affect, recent research suggests that motivational intensity of positive affective states influences these processes. The present experiments examined memory for centrally or peripherally presented information after the evocation of approach-motivated positive affect. Experiment 1 found that, relative to neutral conditions, pregoal, approach-motivated positive affect (caused by a monetary incentives task) <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for centrally presented information, whereas postgoal, low approach-motivated positive affect <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for peripherally presented information. Experiment 2 found that, relative to a neutral condition, high approach-motivated positive affect (caused by appetitive pictures) <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for centrally presented information but hindered memory for peripheral information. These results suggest a more complex relationship between positive affect and memory processes and highlight the importance of considering the motivational intensity of positive affects in cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial {{was to determine whether}} glucose <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory</b> for a repeated auditory stimulus in human newborns. Infants consumed water or glucose (2 -g/kg) solution. Memory test phases were: Orientation (turning towards the stimulus); Habituation (not turning towards), indicating familiarity; Delay (100 seconds); Spontaneous Recovery (stimulus representation: not turning towards indicates remembering, while turning towards indicates forgetting), and Novelty (turning towards a different word confirms wakefulness). Decreased head-turning towards during Spontaneous Recovery indicates <b>enhanced</b> <b>memory.</b> Blood glucose levels were measured after testing. "Glucose" infants had higher blood glucose levels than "water" infants (p < 0. 001). "Glucose" infants had significantly decreased turns towards during Spontaneous Recovery compared to "water" infants (p = 0. 008), indicating memory enhancement. Therefore, glucose specifically <b>enhances</b> <b>memory</b> for a repeated auditory stimulus in newborn humans. Elevating blood glucose levels by approximately 2 mmol/L appears to be sufficient for memory enhancement in healthy newborns...|$|R
