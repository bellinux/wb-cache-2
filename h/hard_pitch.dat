5|$|Boyd {{played only}} one more match for the club, {{two weeks after the}} Cup Final. Not risked in their first match in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, against Internazionale on a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> in the San Siro, he played in their next, a 1–0 win against a Zagreb Select XI in Yugoslavia. Following a {{favourable}} specialist's report during the close season, Boyd took part in pre-season training, but his back still troubled him. On 17 August 1956, the day before Birmingham were to open their 1956–57 League campaign, Boyd's contract with the club was terminated at his own request.|$|E
5|$|On a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> in {{very cold}} weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast to their health, in the hope that a full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E
25|$|The hosts batted {{first in}} the First Test at Newlands in Cape Town on a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> not conducive to spin bowling, and made 382, but Mallett still managed to take 5/126, the leading bowling figures for the innings. In the second innings, he took 1/79 and Australia lost by 170 runs.|$|E

25|$|From 1892, Hearne was {{the stock}} bowler {{not only for}} Middlesex, {{but also for the}} MCC, which at the time played against the {{counties}} Middlesex did not arrange County Championship fixtures with. In 1893, Hearne surpassed his previous form by taking over 200 wickets in a dry summer and his persistence and skill on <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> (notably in the two games with Nottinghamshire) was wonderful. In 1894, a very wet summer, Hearne just failed to reach 200, yet his omission from the 1894/1895 tour of Australia remains puzzling given his persistence and pace from the ground might have been well-suited to the <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> then evolving in Australia.|$|R
2500|$|Renowned for his {{exploits}} on pitches {{suited to}} his bowling, Vogler found difficulty touring Australia where <b>harder</b> <b>pitches</b> inhibited his bowling and his batting. He {{did not play}} a first-class match {{following the end of}} the tour in spring 1911 ...|$|R
25|$|Commercially used {{creosote}} {{is often}} treated {{to extract the}} carbolic acid, naphthalene, or anthracene content. The carbolic acid or naphthalene is generally extracted {{to be used in}} other commercial products. American produced creosote oils typically will have low amounts of anthracene and high amounts of naphthalene, because when forcing the distillate at a temperature that produces anthracene the soft pitch will be ruined and only the <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> will remain; this ruins it for use in roofing purposes, and only leaves a product which isn't commercially useful.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{treating}} wood, it {{was also}} used for lighting and fuel. In the beginning, it was only used for lighting needed in harbour and outdoor work, where the smoke that was produced from burning it was of little inconvenience. By 1879, lamps had been created that ensured a more complete combustion by using compressed air, removing the drawback of the smoke. Creosote was also processed into gas and used for lighting that way. As a fuel, {{it was used to}} power ships at sea and blast furnaces for different industrial needs, once it was discovered to be more efficient than unrefined coal or wood. It was also used industrially for the softening of <b>hard</b> <b>pitch,</b> and burned to produce lamp black. By 1890, the production of creosote in the United Kingdom totaled approximately 29,900,000 gallons per year.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{following}} year the strain on his slight frame of bowling fast began to tell on Haigh, and though his 91 wickets at 18.75 placed him in the top twenty of the national averages, he was already noticed to be less formidable than Yorkshire's other bowlers on firm pitches, but quite unplayable after rain – as in the home games with Surrey and Derbyshire. Although he produced a skilful performance against Middlesex at Lord's on a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> {{the following}} year, Haigh did comparatively little of note except on sticky wickets. On such sticky wickets his return of 14 for 43 beat Hampshire in a day's cricket. Haigh's batting developed and he averaged 26 in 1901, and saved Yorkshire from defeat at Worcestershire in 1900. That year, Haigh took 163 wickets for just over 14 each, and in 1902 he took 158 wickets in 799 overs.|$|E
25|$|Sharpe bowled fast-medium {{and could}} make the ball break back to an unusual degree on <b>hard</b> <b>pitches.</b> His extra-fast yorker was often deadly. Having lost an eye, he had no pretensions as a batsman, but he was quite active {{in the field for}} a player in that time.|$|R
2500|$|The Indian batsmen, {{who were}} {{accustomed}} to [...] "...the fast, <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> in their own country...", could not cope up with the Australian bowling, and especially struggled against the bowling of Ernie Toshack, who exploited the conditions in a versatile manner, and in an extremely short spell of nineteen balls, returned remarkable figures of 5 wickets for a solitary run. The Indians crumbled to 58 all out.|$|R

25|$|Lawrence Cook {{emerged in}} 1907 as a bowler of fast-medium pace, {{possibly}} meant {{to substitute for}} Walter Brearley who was then engaged {{in one of his}} many disputes with the Lancashire committee. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, on the whole his record for that season was moderate, but with seven wickets on a rare <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> against Kent at Canterbury he showed he had great persistence. When Brearley came back into the eleven in 1908, Cook was relegated to the Second Eleven, but in 1910 he re-established in place and in the May following year, helped by a bad pitch and feeble Northamptonshire batting, he bowled with considerable pace and a lot of spin to take eight wickets for 39 runs. Cook indeed bowled so well early that season that Lancashire seemed to have found an excellent pace bowler when Brearley could not play. However, he was felt impossible to fit in when that fast bowler was free from business and on returning to the side he did not maintain his early season form, nor did he do anything of note against the top counties.|$|E
2500|$|... 1896 and 1897, {{with most}} pitches {{unfavourable}} to him due to dry weather, were disappointing, but Mead gradually rebounded {{in the following}} years. An excellent performance against the Australians in 1899 saw Mead chosen for his only Test match at Lord's, but he was harmless on the <b>hard</b> <b>pitch.</b> He remained close {{to the top of}} the first-class averages for every season from 1899 to 1903 – though in 1901 he was helped by some very bad Lord's wickets when playing for the MCC – and in the last-named year was chosen as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden after heading the first-class bowling averages with best match figures of twelve for 76 against Surrey at the Oval and fifteen for 115 against Leicestershire at Leyton.|$|E
60|$|He had {{discovered}} the day before that his canoe leaked a little, and {{said that it was}} owing to stepping into it violently. I asked him where he would get pitch to mend it with, for they commonly use <b>hard</b> <b>pitch,</b> obtained of the whites at Oldtown. He said that he could make something very similar, and equally good, of material which we had with us; and he wished me to guess what. But I could not, and he would not tell me, though he showed me a ball of it when made, as big as a pea and like black pitch, saying, at last, that there were some things which a man did not tell even his wife.|$|E
25|$|At his peak, {{he was one}} of {{the best}} bowlers in England, and it is {{believed}} that the MCC erred in not taking him to Australia, after he was the leading wicket-taker in the country for a struggling Warwickshire side in 1946. That year, on one of the relatively few <b>hard</b> <b>pitches,</b> he took, without the direct assistance of a fielder (seven bowled, three LBW), all ten wickets in an innings against Nottinghamshire.|$|R
2500|$|In 1963, at an Alvin High School game at Clear Creek High School in League City, Texas, Red Murff, a scout for the New York Mets, {{first noticed}} sophomore pitcher Ryan. Coach Watson recounted to Murff that some opponents refused to bat against Ryan {{and how his}} <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> would {{sometimes}} break bones in his catchers' hands. In his subsequent report to the Mets, Murff stated that Ryan had [...] "the best arm I've seen in my life." ...|$|R
50|$|Born on 27 April 1879 (until {{recently}} {{it was thought}} {{he was born in}} 1880), Dennett first played for Gloucestershire in 1903. In his first season, despite exceptionally helpful pitches due to a very wet summer, Dennett fared only moderately, but in 1904, he rose remarkably rapidly to one of the leading bowlers of the day. Cunning and with brilliant ability to flight the ball, Dennett was deadly when the pitch helped him but could be effective even on firm, <b>hard</b> <b>pitches.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Ianiello {{allegedly}} got {{his nickname}} [...] "Matty The Horse" [...] in a youth baseball game. Ianiello was a gifted player {{with a hard}} swing. During one game, the opposing pitcher threw a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch</b> {{into the face of}} the batter. A fight erupted in which Ianiello knocked down the pitcher, who was older and taller than him. After this episode, someone remarked about Ianiello: [...] "That boy is as strong as a horse." ...|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the <b>harder</b> <b>pitches</b> of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|R
2500|$|... 1903 {{was another}} summer totally against fast bowlers, and Lockwood bowled {{very little in}} many matches. Moreover, he rarely bowled at {{anything}} like his old pace and by August he was generally no more than medium pace. Nonetheless, he still did some superb work, most especially his 8 for 110 against Middlesex at Lord's. In 1904, Lockwood bowled very well {{early in the year}} against Derbyshire, but after that, despite <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> emerging, his form (along with Richardson) declined so much that Surrey dropped him before the season was half over.|$|R

25|$|Australia {{dominated}} the five-Test series, beating England 5–0. The England players, led by Johnny Douglas, faced a strong bowling attack, featuring pace bowlers Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald, and the spinner Arthur Mailey. In addition, the bowlers proved ineffective on <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> {{and struggled to}} dismiss a strong Australian batting line-up. After defeat in the second Test, Frederick Toone the MCC manager, suggested Douglas should be replaced as captain by Percy Fender. Hobbs supported such a move, but other professionals in the team were less certain. Although Fender {{was included in the}} team {{for the remainder of the}} series, Douglas retained the captaincy.|$|R
25|$|In 1897, though {{expensive}} as a bowler, Wainwright hit five centuries {{and was named}} for the 1897/1898 Ashes tour in that capacity. However, he again did not perform well in the Tests. 1899 saw Wainwright again of little use as a bowler once the <b>harder</b> <b>pitches</b> came in June, but he played a career-best 228 at the Oval and scored almost as many runs as in 1897. With Rhodes and Haigh now Yorkshire's destroyers on sticky wickets, Wainwright did little bowing in 1900 and 1901 - his last two seasons - but his batting, though inconsistent, remained of use as a last resort.|$|R
50|$|Citizens {{interested}} in culture attend concerts, plays and presentations {{in the district}} seat of Kusel, only 5 km away. Hüfﬂer has an extensive leisure park called Am Isack, which lies on the former prospecting ground. It has campsites, sporting grounds and tennis courts. Local clubs and visitors also have an angling pond and a grill pavilion at their disposal. Hüfﬂer also has a sport club, SV Hüfﬂer. This is known mainly for its football department, but it also offers tennis. Until summer 2008, football had to be played on a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch,</b> but after the club’s 50th anniversary, the ﬁeld was converted to grass in the 2008/2009 season.

50|$|On {{the next}} Monday, those few spectators not {{discouraged}} by the wintry weather watched an attractive and well-contested 2-2 draw with Aston Villa in a friendly at Coventry Road, followed {{a few days later}} by a rather more lacklustre friendly against Derby Midland that finished with the same score. Alliance competition resumed with a visit to Newton Heath. On a <b>hard</b> <b>pitch,</b> Small Heath attacked from the start, playing a passing game, but failed to convert any of their chances. Newton Heath scored either side of the interval, each goal going in off a Small Heath full back, then, after Hallam scored with a high shot, a lively finish to the game produced a third home goal.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, Townsend bowled on {{a sticky}} wicket at Lord's {{to win the}} opening match against Middlesex, and, though on the <b>hard</b> <b>pitches</b> his bowling was largely harmless, his skill as a batsman reached far beyond that of {{previous}} years and he hit five centuries - the highest being 159 against Lancashire. When the rain returned in August, he lost his batting, but his bowling was - remarkably - even more irresistible than in 1895. Across five matches he bowled 1,533 balls with 65 maidens, taking 64 wickets for 715 runs and a bowling average of 11.17 runs per wicket.|$|R
25|$|In 1900, whilst he {{produced}} impressive performances against the two leading counties (Yorkshire and Lancashire), Hearne could not recover his form, {{and apart from}} a few reasonable performances for the MCC the year 1901 was disastrous, with his average in purely county matches blowing out to over 30 runs per wicket. 1902 – the first really wet summer since 1894 – was equally disappointing, with a succession of rain-affected pitches only rarely exploited and little evidence of his old skill on the few <b>hard</b> <b>pitches.</b> Consequently, Hearne disappeared from consideration for Test and other representative selection, even during his occasional recoveries of form.|$|R
