40|$|Solar PV as a {{disruptive}} innovation {{is changing the}} established energy industry. It forces energy incumbents to compete on a new market, and on new features. This research sets out to investigate how Fortum should be dealing with this {{disruptive innovation}}. This study is conducted in two parts, first it is analysed what the effects are of solar PV being labelled disruptive. This determines whether Fortum should at all be participating in this new disruptive market. The second part analyses the value chain to determine what parts Fortum should be active in, {{as well as the}} value network to determine what role Fortum should be playing amongst other parties in the network. For the empirical research eight expert interviews have been conducted. The market <b>entry</b> <b>advice</b> for Fortum in the solar PV industry is a wholeheartedly yes. It was found that solar PV will slowly but surely invade the established energy industry, and to avoid from being disrupted in the future, it is recommended Fortum plays a role in this new industry. The value chain analysis indicated that Fortum should focus on the sales operations of solar PV panels, and the after-sales service. Fortum is able to build comparative advantage around these activities using current capabilities and assets. Fortum is furthermore recommended to create a value network around itself, for which it was seen to have a strong foundation. The report ultimately recommends Fortum to pursue a platform strategy that would benefit all participants, value network partners and prosumers alike. Fortum would benefit from this platform by entrenching itself in this disruptive market and driving more value its own way...|$|E

50|$|The {{challenge}} for the celebrities was to travel around the globe in eighty days, starting and ending at the Reform Club in London, re-enacting the challenge made to Phileas Fogg in the Jules Verne novel, Around the World in Eighty Days, and Michael Palin's Around the World in 80 Days. In each episode, a pair of celebrities travels a single leg of the round-the-world journey, trying to meet the next pair at a handover point in sufficient time, in relay race fashion. The journey could be completed by any means except by flight. At the handover, they pass to the succeeding team a carpet bag containing, amongst other items, a journal and a phone. Each of the celebrity pairs contributed to the journal as their leg of the journey progressed, and ahead of the trip Palin wrote an <b>entry</b> containing <b>advice</b> for the travellers.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} advice {{giving in}} counseling within labor market training. A stepwise <b>entry</b> to <b>advice</b> {{has previously been}} studied in settings in which profession-als display expert perspectives on “officially ” recommended courses of action. In these settings, elicitation of the advisee’s perspective enables the professional to fit their advice with it, create alignment between the perspectives, and minimize resis-tance. This article shows how the pattern works in a setting in which the counselor’s role {{is that of a}} facilitator of learning; 2 variations of the pattern are discussed. The 1 st shows how it is used to establish a point that justifies advice concerning the stu-dent’s career-related decisions. The 2 nd variation, the main focus, shows how the counselor uses the pattern to evaluate the student’s plans, thus gaining an argumen-tatively advantageous position for the advice. In this article, I examine a particular sequence structure, stepwise en-try to advice, in which advice is prepared with a question–answer se-quence. The sequence appears in counseling encounters in a Finnish adult education setting in phases in which counselors and students discuss stu...|$|R
40|$|Comunicación presentada en European Economic Association & Econometric Society. 2012 Parallel Meetings, celebrada del 27 al 31 de agosto de 2012 en Málaga (España) We {{conduct a}} {{laboratory}} experiment, in which subjects {{decide whether to}} enter a tournament, {{in which they have}} to perform a real effort task. In one treatment subjects receive advice on whether to participate in the tournament. Advice is given by subjects who have already had some experience with the same decision and have some informational advantage. We show that advice significantly improves the entry decision of subjects. The total costs of wrong entry decisions go significantly down and the payoffs of those who receive advice go up. This is mainly driven by the fact that high ability women enter the tournament significantly more often while low ability men enter significantly less often. Though the gender gap in tournament entry is reduced, it still persists. Overall, advice given tends to be ‘good’ advice. Finally, we find that women are slightly more hesitant than men to <b>advice</b> <b>entry</b> into tournament. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
