The height of the main office building helps to create a point of reference for the entire plant.

The exhibition pavilion is acros from the Office tower. The idea was to pick up on old industrial building design.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main idea}} of this paper {{consists}} in creation of the optimal depth of shell which provides optimal stress distribution in quenched <b>steel</b> <b>parts.</b> For small <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> optimal quenched layer can be provided by using of low and limited hardenability steels (LH). For big <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> optimal quenched layer can be provided by use of low alloy steels. Since the LH steel core does not harden significantly, the ductility of the core is also maintained. The same is true when using low alloy steels for manufacturing big <b>steel</b> <b>parts.</b> The grain sizes of LH steels are above ASTM 8. It is shown that {{the high level of}} compressive surface residual stresses and steel superstrengthening phenomenon can eliminate the need for secondary shot peening or surface induction operations. Also carburized alloy steels can be successfully replaced by LH steels to increase service life and decrease cost of materials. Key- Words:- Optimized quenched layer, High compressive residual stresses, Superstrengthened material...|$|R

The instrument uses incident-polarization electro-optical modulation, division-of-amplitude photopolarimetry, and software-implemented Fourier-transform {{analysis of the}} detected signals to determine the scattered Mueller matrix of the sample.

40|$|AbstractHot-stamped high {{strength}} <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> {{are widely used}} to achieve lightweight of automobile. However, mechanical properties of formed {{high strength}} <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> are difficult to control and predict. In order to realize field nondestructive testing of hot forming high strength <b>steel</b> <b>parts,</b> magnetic Barkhausen noise which is sensitive to microstructure of ferromagnet was used. In the paper, magnetic Barkhausen noise signals of hot-stamped high strength steel strips with different hardness were measured and analyzed. A substantial correlation was found between magnetic Barkhausen noise and hardness (in range 220 ∼ 450 HV). Then, frequency domain analysis based on autoregressive modeling was done to find out signal components which are dependent and independent to hardness of the hot-stamped high strength steel. Independent signals can be eliminated based on the frequency analysis. Accordingly, the measurement accuracy can be improved for application in industrial field...|$|R

40|$|It is {{required}} that Di- 2 -ethylhexyl Sebacate oil, also {{commonly known as}} Dioctyl Sebacate oil, be thoroughly removed from certain metals, in this case stainless <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> with narrow, enclosed spaces. Dioctyl Sebacate oil is a synthetic oil with a low compressibility. As such, it is ideally used for high pressure calibrations. The current method to remove the Dioctyl Sebacate from stainless <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> with narrow, enclosed spaces is a labor-intensive, multi-step process, including a detergent clean, a deionized (DI) water rinse, and several solvent rinses, to achieve a nonvolatile residue of 0. 04 mg per 50 mL rinse effluent. This study was undertaken to determine a superior detergent/solvent cleaning method for the oil to reduce cleaning time and/or the amount of detergent/solvent used. It was determined that while some detergent clean the oil off the metal better than the current procedure, using only solvents obtained the best result. In addition, it can be inferred, based on elevated temperature test results, that raising {{the temperature of the}} oil-contaminated stainless <b>steel</b> <b>parts</b> to approximately 50 %C 2 %B 0 C will provide for improved cleaning efficacy...|$|R
