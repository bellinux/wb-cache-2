40|$|In this paper, a novel kind of {{method to}} monitor {{corrosion}} expansion of steel rebars in steel reinforced concrete structures named <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coil</b> winding method is proposed, discussed and tested. It {{is based on}} the fiber optical Brillouin sensing technique. Firstly, a strain calibration experiment is designed and conducted to obtain the strain coefficient of single mode fiber optics. Results have shown that there is a good linear relationship between Brillouin frequency and applied strain. Then, three kinds of novel fiber optical Brillouin corrosion expansion sensors with different <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coil</b> winding packaging schemes are designed. Sensors were embedded into concrete specimens to monitor expansion strain caused by steel rebar corrosion, and their performance was studied in a designed electrochemical corrosion acceleration experiment. Experimental results have shown that expansion strain along the <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coil</b> winding area can be detected and measured by the three kinds of sensors with different measurement range during development the corrosion. With the assumption of uniform corrosion, diameters of corrosion steel rebars were obtained using calculated average strains. A maximum expansion strain of 6, 738 με was monitored. Furthermore, the uniform corrosion analysis model was established and the evaluation formula to evaluate mass loss rate of steel rebar under a given corrosion rust expansion rate was derived. The research has shown that three kinds of Brillouin sensors can be used to monitor the steel rebar corrosion expansion of reinforced concrete structures with good sensitivity, accuracy and monitoring range, and can be applied to monitor different levels of corrosion. By means of this kind of monitoring technique, quantitative corrosion expansion monitoring can be carried out, with the virtues of long durability, real-time monitoring and quasi-distribution monitoring...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA Mach-Zehnder interferometric <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> gradient hydrophone, for operation at 632. 8 nm wavelength, {{was designed and}} constructed for testing in the laboratory. Two individual <b>fiber</b> <b>optic</b> hydrophone sensing <b>coils</b> with 10 m of fiber each were wound and potted on an epoxy mandrel and their respective sensitivities were obtained. They then were mounted on a rigid bar, separated by 10 cm, to form a gradient hydrophone.
