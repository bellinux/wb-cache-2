25|$|Because the ESR {{decreases}} {{with increasing}} frequencies. the ripple current <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> value, specified at 100/120Hz, can be higher at higher frequencies. In {{cases like this}} manufacturers specify correction factors for ripple current values at higher frequencies. For example, the ripple current at 10kHz can usually be approximated to be 30 to 40% higher than the 100/120 value.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{a highly}} toxic and {{flammable}} gas (flammable range: 4.3–46%). Being heavier than air, it tends to accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late. For safe handling procedures, a hydrogen sulfide safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> (SDS) should be consulted.|$|E

40|$|Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> are {{the primary}} source of hazard {{information}} on chemical substances and mixtures and are used to inform risk assessments. It is imperative to ascertain the quality of this primary source of information in informing risk based decision making. The content of Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> (SDS) is governed by regulatory requirements outlined under the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). However, regulation in itself does not provide assurance {{of the quality of the}} content of the SDS. This study assesses and creates an awareness of the quality of Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> and establishes the criteria for ranking the quality of various sections in the SDS. 200 Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets</b> have been selected from the aerospace sector and assessed for their quality. A review of the 200 SDS has identified significant statistical differences between the various sections of the SDS and the quality of information between hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals. The data analysis suggests a limited impact of GHS and REACH, Annex II Regulations on the overall quality of content of the Safety <b>Data</b> <b>Sheets...</b>|$|R

25|$|After a {{measuring}} time of 2 or 5 minutes, {{depending on the}} <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> specification, the measured leakage current value has to be lower than the calculated value. Normally the leakage current is always lower the longer the capacitor voltage is applied. The leakage current during operation after, for example, one hour is the operational leakage current. This value depends strongly on the manufacturer's series characteristics. It could be lower than 1/100 of the specified value.|$|E
25|$|The safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for {{unleaded}} gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts, including benzene (up to 5% by volume), toluene (up to 35% by volume), naphthalene (up to 1% by volume), trimethylbenzene (up to 7% by volume), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (up to 18% by volume, in some states) and about ten others. Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities, with LD50 of 700–2700mg/kg for simple aromatic compounds. Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the strong}} (i.e., unity gain) {{feedback}} and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor stability margins. Consequently, the system may be unstable when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a lag compensation network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) {{can be used to}} restore stability. The manufacturer <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.|$|E

The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The safety <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161mg/kg for a rat.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{is measured}} according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m·K) {{depending on the}} density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 W/(m·K) was obtained at 15kg/m3 while the value of 0.032 W/(m·K) was obtained at 40kg/m3 according to the <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030–0.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK & EU.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas with}} {{coal-fired}} power stations, {{the use of}} CFLs saves on mercury emissions {{when compared to the}} use of incandescent bulbs. This is due to the reduced electrical power demand, reducing in turn the amount of mercury released by coal as it is burned. In July 2008 the U.S. EPA published a <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> stating that the net system emission of mercury for CFL lighting was lower than for incandescent lighting of comparable lumen output. This was based on the average rate of mercury emission for U.S. electricity production and average estimated escape of mercury from a CFL put into a landfill. Coal-fired plants also emit other heavy metals, sulfur, and carbon dioxide.|$|E

25|$|Mirror-image {{insertion}} protection {{means that}} a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the <b>data</b> <b>sheet).</b> For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.|$|E

People live in tight-knit joint families, although a nuclear family system is emerging due to changing socio-economic conditions. Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region, as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and caste. [...] However, the influences of more modern societies have effected some change, particularly {{in the area of the}} dowry system. As of 2016, monogamous and polygamous unions remain an acceptable marriage practice. In following ancient culture, marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers. In some instances, the husband must buy his wife from her parents. Marriage ceremonies, which can be more or less formal, include rituals which are universal in nature and hold sociological importance. Studies conducted in 2007 and 2013, the latter in an outlying rural village in Faisalabad District, acknowledged the existence of gender bias and discrimination against females, stating that [...] "Gender discrimination is not a new phenomenon", and that it still exists in the modern world. It was further noted that situations may be worse in villages because [...] "whenever a girl is born, nobody celebrates her birth, whereas when a boy is born, it means great joy and celebration." ...|$|E
