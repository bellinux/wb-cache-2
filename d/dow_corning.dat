50|$|The Dows Community School District, {{established}} in 1914, served {{the community of}} Dows, Iowa for 100 years. It served as a full K-12 school system until the last class graduated in 1998. In 1963, Dows recorded its largest enrollment of 532 students in K-12, 50 in kindergarten alone. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, enrollment declined. In the fall of 1998, a 2-way whole grade sharing agreement began with CAL Community School District of Latimer, Iowa. The shared high school was at CAL, the shared middle school (6-8) was at Dows, and both districts maintained their own separate elementary schools. This agreement continued for seven years. Beginning in 2005-06, Dows ended the agreement with CAL and began a 1-way whole grade sharing agreement with Clarion-Goldfield. Dows maintained a P/K-5 elementary school and shared numerous administration, faculty, and staff positions. In September 2013, voters of both districts approved consolidation into a single district. The Dows School was closed {{in the spring of}} 2014, in its centennial year of operation. An all-school reunion was held at <b>Dows</b> <b>Corn</b> Days in August 2014. The district became part of the Clarion-Goldfield-Dows Community School District with all students attending classes and activities in Clarion in the fall of 2014.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of genetically modified}} plants (e. g. Bt-maize) is currently an alternative method of controlling major crops pests. Therefore, {{is important to know}} the influence of Bt-plants on pest and non-pest insects. This study aimed evaluate the impact of Cry 1 F and Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2 proteins Bt expressed in corncobs on larval development of Spodoptera eridania (Cramer, 1782) and Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1789) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The immature grains were offered ad libitum to new-hatched larvae (until 24 hs old), to compare the development of the specimens fed to non-Bt <b>corn</b> (<b>DOW</b> 2 B 688) and two isogenic Bt, that express one (Cry 1 F) and three insecticides protein (Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2). The larvae survived less than two days when consumed both Bt immature grains and reach 100 % of mortality. Spodoptera eridania reared on non-Bt corns grains shows a longer longevity (21. 6 days) than S. frugiperda (18. 4 days), but a lower viability (56. 5 % and 80. 2 % to S. eridania and S. frugiperda, respectively). Interesting, S. eridania consume a more amount immature grains (5. 4 g) than S. frugiperda (3. 9 g). In summary, this study confirms that the toxins Cry 1 F, Cry 1 F+Cry 1 A. 105 +Cry 2 Ab 2 expressed in fresh corncobs are an important tool to protect the corn ears against S. frugiperda and the nontarget pest S. eridania, however is important monitored the non-Bt corn fields due the possibility of this species caused damage in ears corn. 201...|$|R

25|$|A major {{manufacturer}} of silicone breast implants, <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> (Dow Chemical's Joint Venture with Corning Inc.) was sued for personal damages caused by ruptured implants. On October 6, 2005, all such cases {{pending in the}} District Court against the company were dismissed. A number of large, independent reviews of the scientific literature, including the Institute of Medicine in the United States, have subsequently found that silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancers or any identifiable systemic disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{twenty-six years}} after the 1962 {{introduction}} of breast implants filled with silicone gel, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated breast implant failures and the subsequent complications, and re-classified breast implant devices as Class III medical devices, and required from manufacturers the documentary data substantiating the safety and efficacy of their breast implant devices. In 1992, the FDA placed silicone-gel breast implants in moratorium in the U.S., because there was “inadequate information to demonstrate that breast implants were safe and effective”. Nonetheless, medical access to silicone-gel breast implant devices continued for clinical studies of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, the correction of congenital deformities, and the replacement of ruptured silicone-gel implants. The FDA required from the manufacturers the clinical trial data, and permitted their providing breast implants to the breast augmentation patients for the statistical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In mid–1992, the FDA approved an adjunct study protocol for silicone-gel filled implants for breast reconstruction patients, and for revision-surgery patients. Also in 1992, the <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> Corporation, a silicone products and breast implant manufacturer, announced the discontinuation of five implant-grade silicones, but would continue producing 45 other, medical-grade, silicone materials—three years later, in 1995, the <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> Corporation went bankrupt when it faced 19,000 breast implant sickness lawsuits.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-twentieth century, Morton I. Berson, in 1945, and Jacques Maliniac, in 1950, each {{performed}} flap-based breast augmentations {{by rotating}} the patient’s chest wall tissue into the breast {{to increase its}} volume. Furthermore, throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, plastic surgeons used synthetic fillers—including silicone injections received by some 50,000 women, from which developed silicone granulomas and breast hardening that required treatment by mastectomy. In 1961, the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> Corporation, developed the first silicone breast prosthesis, filled with silicone gel; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962 using the Cronin–Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963. In 1964, the French company Laboratoires Arion developed and manufactured the saline breast implant, filled with saline solution, and then introduced {{for use as a}} medical device in 1964.|$|E
500|$|In 1893, to {{the east}} of this, there was a timber pond of [...] {{connected}} to No.1 dock by a short channel almost parallel with the then existing dry-dock but this link was later severed and part of its length converted to another dry-dock and the pond beyond dispensed with and filled in {{to make way for the}} necessary high-level rail viaducts and embankments run to the No.2 dock coal hoists. [...] The remaining dry-dock, minus its floatable caisson, is still flooded with the waterline commoned with that of the two docks (July 2017). By 1901 with No.2 dock in use, a second timber pond was included north of the dock. It was partly backfilled after 1960 but intersected by the docks road level crossing (Wimborne Rd)from Cadoxton to the Bendricks. This is the single line railfreight link from Network Rail's Cadoxton station to the No.2 docks quays and south-side rail infrastructure and includes a 180° curve from north-west to south-east side of the dock, this now being the only rail access to the entire docks area and serving remaining sidings on the Sully Moors industrial complex, <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> silicone plant and intermodal railfreight traffic(2017).|$|E

2500|$|... {{the first}} {{technological}} developments were a thinner-gauge device-shell, and a filler gel of low-cohesion silicone, which improved the functionality and the verisimilitude (size, appearance, and texture) of the silicone-gel breast implant. Yet, in clinical practice, second-generation breast implants proved fragile, and suffered greater incidences of shell rupture, and of filler leakage ("silicone-gel bleed") through the intact device shell. The consequent, increased incidence-rates of medical complications (e.g. capsular contracture) precipitated faulty-product, class action-lawsuits, by the U.S. government, against the <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> Corporation, and other manufacturers of breast prostheses.|$|E
2500|$|Like many {{platinum}} compounds, {{chloroplatinic acid}} {{is used in}} catalysis. This compound was first reported by John Speier and colleagues from <b>Dow</b> <b>Corning</b> Corporation to catalyze the addition of silyl hydrides to olefins, hydrosilylation. [...] Early test reactions used isopropanol solutions of trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) with pentenes. Prior work on the addition of silanes to alkenes required radical reactions that were inefficient. As well as with Karstedt's catalyst, Speier's catalyst enjoys widespread use for hydrosilylation, the main drawback is the deliquescent properties of the catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|From 1940 to 1941, Dow {{built its}} first plant at Freeport, Texas, {{in order to}} produce {{magnesium}} extracted from seawater rather than underground brine. [...] The Freeport plant is now home to Dow's largest site – and one of the largest integrated chemical manufacturing sites in the world. The site grew quickly – with power, chlorine, caustic soda and ethylene also soon in production. Growth of this business made Dow a strategically important business during World War II, as magnesium became important in fabricating lightweight parts for aircraft. Based on 2002–2003 data, the Freeport plants (known as Texas Operations internally) produced 27 billion pounds of product – or 21 percent of Dow's global production. In 1942 Dow began its foreign expansion with the formation of Dow Chemical of Canada in Sarnia, Ontario to produce styrene for use in styrene-butadiene synthetic rubber.
