However, the continuity of pastoral (<b>extensive</b> <b>livestock)</b> <b>farm</b> operation is threatened {{due to the lack}} of successors and a comparatively high cost for labour (in competition with other economic activities, i.e. tourism). Some farmers, particularly younger ones, reject sheep and goat farming because of the harsh working conditions and the low social status associated with this occupation. Moreover, despite the synergy between livestock and tourism activities (the latter is often claimed as an opportunity for rural development), in many cases, the two activities are competing for labour and other local resources, resulting in the tourism sector eventually reducing or substituting for agricultural activities (Teruel et al. 1995; Manrique et al. 1999).|$|E
40|$|Evaluation {{of effects}} of agri-environmental {{measures}} on rangeland degradation in two less-favoured areas in Portugal Nadia Manuela Jones In the past decades {{there have been}} significant land use changes in Portugal. After the integration of Portugal in the EU, farmers {{have been able to}} benefit from EU policy measures, which were initially mainly aimed at supporting farmer’s income. It soon became apparent that these land use changes led to both intensification and abandonment of land, which were detrimental to the environment in various ways, in particular to higher soil erosion hazards and to an increased incidence of wildfire. The thesis assesses the impact of agro-environmental policies on agro-ecosystem goods and services and land degradation at farm and regional levels in Portugal. It identifies the main land use changes, provides insight in the role of past policy measures targeting the preservation of extensive grazing in marginal areas, and explores the options for the improvement of future policy measures. First an historical review is provided of land use changes in Portugal and their implications for land degradation and conservation. Thereafter an analysis is made of the farming systems in two less favoured areas in Centro and Alentejo regions, which showed an increasing focus on livestock and rangeland activities. Subsequently an assessment is made of the role of two specific EU agri-environmental measures (AEM) that preserve extensive grazing in these two less-favoured areas in Portugal.  Thereby attention is paid to the uptake of these AEMs and to their effects on preserving reduced stocking rates and sufficient soil cover.   An analysis is also made of the AEM payments and other EU subsidy flows, and their changes over the period 2005 - 2009, and of the effectiveness of the financial incentives offered through the two specific AEMS for preserving extensive grazing in the two research areas. Finally a normative analysis is made, whereby the impact of agri-environmental policy is targeted. Through scenario analysis of different combinations of policy measures for the two research areas, the impacts on <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> production, soil erosion risk and wildfire hazard are assessed. A final discussion about the respective research results is presented in the synthesis of the thesis.    ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{productive and}} reproductive {{results of the}} simulations made with an <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> model on basaltic soils. The scenari were constructed varying the initial grass height (GH) and the system stocking rate (SR). The model is chaotic, dynamic, empirical and deterministic. It was built in a participatory way {{with a group of}} local stakeholders of the basaltic region of the country (Uruguay). A simplified version of it was utilized, where only one parcel and only one animal category were simulated each time. No adaptive management was implemented into the simulation process. These models represent a Breeding (Br) and a Rearing (Re) extensive systems, where the exclusive feed source is the natural pasture. All scenari were simulated with average pasture growth, estimated by satellite remote sensing for the series 2000 - 2010, for a representative farm basaltic region. Annual results of pregnancy rate and live weight gain per animal were the two main outputs analyzed for the Br and Re simulated systems, respectively. In the scenari building the two input variables changed stepwise were the initial GH (going from 2 to 12 cm) as indicator of the forage availability, and the initial number of animals (going from 0. 1 to 1. 9 animal/ha) as indicator of the SR. The initial situation for the Br simulation was cows of 360 kg of average live weight. The start of the simulation was at the beginning of autumn, and the calving and mating seasons were spring and summer, respectively. For the Re simulation, the initial situation was defined by heifers with an average live weight of 150 kg. Simulation started also at the beginning of autumn. For the Br simulations results of pregnancy rates higher than 80 % are only achieved in the scenari of low and mean SR ( 10 cm). If the initial GH on autumn is 5 cm, to achieve that pregnancy rate level, the SR must be less than 0. 9 cows/ha. For the Re simulation, results of gain per animal bigger than 100 kg/heifer are attained in a continuum of situations going from 3 cm and 0. 1 animals/ha to 12 cm and 1. 5 animals/ha. The results of simulation are consistent with the real situations on basaltic soils, showing that low forage availability ( 0. 9 animals/ha in silico) compromise seriously the productive and reproductive performances of the system.

40|$|<b>Extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> was {{the driver}} of {{agricultural}} colonization and territorial structuring in the Amazon. Since 2008, Amazonian agriculture has been facedwith radical changes in Brazilian policies concerning agricultural land use and the preservation of forest areas. The very viability of livestock systems is threatened and there is thus an urgent need for feasible alternatives to enable the development of sustainable agriculture. Some alternatives are currently being tested by public extension services and private operators. The question is, can these alternatives really be considered as ecological intensification? Defined as ecologically friendly agricultural development, this new trend of intensification aims to reconcile cattle ranching {{and the protection of}} Amazon forest ecosystems. Our analysis, based on three contrastedmunicipalities in Para´ State, focuses on the points of view of different stakeholders in the livestock sector. Results showthe dominance of classical intensification among the alternatives envisaged, but it is an option that small family farmers cannot easily afford. Alternatives based on land sharing, which promotes agricultural production and environmental preservation on the same areas, are less well known and will require more coordination among local actors.

30|$|The {{perception}} of apathy demonstrated by owners and herders alike could also {{arise from the}} subsistence nature of <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> in Botswana, which may not necessarily require intensive herd management. It is a low-input, low-output system. A similar observation has been made by McGahey (2011) in Botswana’s Ngamiland, where there was positive attitude among some livestock owners and herders towards veterinary cordon fences particularly in curbing stock theft and preventing cattle from straying as far as Namibia. People are aware that their livestock cannot go beyond the cordon fences (barring permeability due to wildlife and anthropogenic damage), and so, they let their stock graze freely within the area without close herding or no herding at all. This is even more so during dry seasons when water sources become key focal points where livestock congregate, thereby reducing herding labour demand as well as time to round up the animals. Even in instances where animals do go astray, herders and owners will search for them {{within the confines of}} the cordon fences first, before raising an alarm. And since the last FMD outbreaks in the study area were recorded in 2002 and 2003, it is natural for people in general to let their guard down once a perceived threat has passed.|$|R

40|$|Livestock {{production}} systems are progressively shifting towards an industrialized model that is outcompeting <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> in regions such as Mediterranean Europe. The {{objective of this}} paper is to contribute to the ongoing debate on the environmental sustainability of these changing livestock systems by focusing on two linked environmental issues (wildfires and climate change) and on Spain as a representative study case. In recent decades, wildfires have dramatically increased in Spain. This process is mainly attributed to the decline of traditional rural activities such as livestock grazing, which used to reduce fuel loads and fire risk. To offset this trend, several Spanish wildfire prevention programmes are currently remunerating livestock farmers for fuelbreak grazing services. Meanwhile, the Spanish food chain is increasingly furnished by market-driven industrialized livestock {{production systems}}, which are large contributors to climate change. These systems require many external inputs, such as abundant feedstuff, are poorly integrated with crop production and are, therefore, very demanding in terms of fossil energy and other non-renewable resources. From this perspective, it is concluded that environmental sustainability in livestock production systems is closely linked to basing animal intake on pastures and other locally produced resources. This approach constitutes an effective climate change mitigation strategy and can improve forest conservation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Against a {{background}} of climate change and volatile energy markets, land is becoming a scarcer resource. This might increase insecurity in supply and prices of agri-food products. Outputs need to increase without further compromising environmental quality and other system services, which inevitably implies trade-offs. From this perspective, maintaining certain levels of agricultural production or safeguarding the potential to domestically produce helps to buffer against shocks. As such, the need for improving the capacity of agricultural systems to ensure ecosystem services has been thoroughly recognized. We evaluate aggregated ecosystem services provided by bioproductive space in an integrative manner. We focus on a case of extensive meat production in Flanders. Here, provisional services are combined with nature management and agro-tourism in a semi-natural landscape. We determine the aggregated output of a selection of agro- and ecosystem services. This allows us to compare how <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> compares to a hypothesized conventional <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> in the same area. This case study demonstrates that extensive land use strategies may provide higher societal benefits (i. e. output of agro- ecosystem services) than intensive land use strategies in regions with both ‘inferior’ and high quality land and under high urbanization pressure. However, without biophysical constraints the intensive land use strategies might outperform extensive land use strategies. Such aggregation of agro- and ecosystem services can be included in an analytical framework for maximizing the provision of services in a landscape. With this in mind, we discuss {{the potential of the}} framework to incorporate resilience thinking in spatial planning. status: publishe...|$|R

Sampling units used were regional divisions (comarques). High density of Bearded Vulture was principally linked to areas with scant vegetation and low human population density. In contrast, high densities of both the Egyptian and Eurasian Griffon Vultures were associated with availability of trophic resources (sheep and goats). Positive effects were detected in relation to low density of inhabitants (Egyptian Vulture) and altitudes between 1, 000 - 2, 000 m and landscape with low tree cover (Eurasian Griffon Vulture). The Bearded Vulture {{seemed to be the}} most selective species in relation to environmental characteristics while the Eurasian Griffon and the Egyptian Vultures displayed a higher degree of ecological plasticity. Future conservation actions should bear these results in mind in order to optimise management. Food resources from <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming,</b> in particular, seem fundamental for the conservation of scavenger species. Preference monitoring and conservation efforts are needed in the regions with highest vulture densities (Alta Ribagorça, Pallars Jussà and Alt Urgell), while regions with low vulture populations should be managed in order to favour the geographical expansion and recolonisation of zones currently not occupied by these species.

30|$|As {{described}} above, cattle have {{a certain}} intake of soil when grazing. The amount of soil ingested by cattle during grazing {{is closely related to}} the condition of the soil and the grass cover. For areas with good grass cover, a minimum share of 3 % soil in ingested pasture grass (88 % dm) is expected (the share of soil intake refers to the weight of ingested grass recalculated to 88 % dry mass) [10, 50]. Soil uptake during grazing can increase at low vegetation coverage. 10 – 20 % of total ingested dry matter may consist of soil. Dry weather and droughts, therefore, {{have a significant impact on}} soil intake and lead to higher exposure to soil contaminants. Wet weather can also lead to an increase in soil intake. When grazing areas become wet and muddy a higher share of soil/mud particles is transferred to vegetation due to splashing water and trampling damage caused by grazing livestock. Higher soil intake already results in exceedance of regulatory limits at lower levels in soil. Therefore, with climate change, exposure to soil will increase due to droughts and high precipitation, and livestock will become more exposed to soil pollution in future. <b>Extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> with elevated soil uptake in climate-impacted areas will likely need even more stringent soil limits.|$|R

The appearance of the countryside bordered by the Tisza, Bodrog and Latorca rivers was substantially changed by the deforestation and later, between 1845 and 1890, by the regulation of the rivers and flood control measures. The essay examines how the transformation of the landscape influenced the historical processes of peasant farming, the society and culture. Under its influence the earlier difference between the flood plains and the flood-free levels ceased to exist and there was a considerable overall increase in the proportion of ploughland. However, there was a marked decline in the area of grazing land that had provided the fodder for the earlier <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> With considerable differences between villages, the structure of peasant farms shifted towards keeping cattle in barns and in agriculture the role of fodder production greatly increased. The changes percolated through peasant society very slowly: a substantial part of the population continued to farm on infertile land. Many people sought prosperity in America and used the money earned there to buy land in their Bodrogköz settlements. The hierarchy of settlements in the region was also greatly altered by the transformation of the countryside. However, the region as a whole remained disadvantaged and the development of its society is still contradictory even today...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} {{the sustainability of}} beef cattle systems of the Spanish Rangelands known as “Dehesas”. These are traditional systems of the Iberian Peninsula where native herbaceous vegetation and evergreen species of Quercus {{provide the basis for}} <b>extensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms.</b> These systems are considered as outstanding High Nature Value (HNV) farming systems and the most extensive agroforestry systems in Europe according to CORINE Land Cover. Beef farms in this area show low stocking rates and a small dependence on foodstuff purchases. However, certain changes have occurred in the last decadesdue to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On the one hand, some farms have become more intensified, as a way to maximize the revenues from the CAP subsidies. On the other hand, many farms have turned to organic production, trying to take advantage both of new subsidies and of new market trends. In this regard, the organic <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> model is gaining weight as an option for sustainable production since, according to various authors, these systems have advantages over conventional and intensive systems. In fact, organic production in the area has increased substantially in recent years due to several factors, such as the growing interest of the EU towards preserving sensitive ecosystems, the potential role of organic production in the development of rural areas and the growing consumers’ demand for safer and higher quality foods produced under ethical and environmental standards. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment of the sustainability of different conventional and organic beef production systems located in dehesa rangelands. The systems analyzed were classified as follows. (i) non-organic farms (Conventional); (ii) organic farms that sold calves at weaning age as conventional ones (Organic 1); (iii) organic farms that fattened and sold their calves as organic (Organic 2).

The contribution of livestock to climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission greatly vary under different management regimes. A number of mitigation options comprise livestock management, although {{there are a lot}} of uncertainties as to which management regime to use for a given pedoclimatic and farming system. Therefore, we 1) tested if an <b>extensive</b> cattle <b>livestock</b> <b>farm</b> is a net sink or a net source for GHG (carbon–dioxide, CO 2; methane, CH 4; nitrous oxide N 2 O) in Central‒Eastern Europe, 2) compared the annual GHG balances between the grazed and mowed treatments of the farm 3) and investigated the role of climate variability in shaping these balances. Net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 (NEE) was measured with eddy covariance technique in both the grazed and mowed treatments. Estimations of lateral C fluxes were based on management data. Other GHG fluxes (CH 4, N 2 O) were determined by chamber gas flux measurements technique (in case of soil) and IPCC guidelines (in case of manure decomposition and animal fermentation). Net greenhouse gas balance (NGHG) for the grazed treatment was 228 ± 283 g CO 2 equivalent m– 2 year– 1 (net sink) and – 475 ± 144 g CO 2 equiv. m– 2 year– 1 (net source) for the mowed treatment. Net source activity at the mowed treatment was due to its higher herbage use intensity compared to the grazed treatment. At the farm scale the system was estimated to be a net sink for NGHG in a year with wet (135 g CO 2 equiv. m– 2 year– 1), while a net source in years with dry soil moisture conditions (– 267 ± 214 g CO 2 equiv. m– 2 year– 1). We conclude that under a temperate continental climate extended extensive grazing could serve as a potential mitigation of GHG in contrast to mowing. Our study highlights the fact that <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> could create a net sink for GHG under proper management regimes. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for farmers’ engagement on the issues related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation in <b>extensive</b> low-input <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. The framework used was based on Participatory Action Research (PAR). This involved integrating quantitative evidence on GHG emission impacts at the farm level and qualitative data on the obstacles {{to the adoption of}} innovation based on farmers’ perceptions and attitudes to climate change. The study aims at building social capital among 14 farmers in the South West and West Midlands regions in England, and it evaluates {{the potential for}} adoption of emission mitigation strategies. The Rapid Farm Practices Appraisal (RFPA) tool was created to assess farm practices based on their mitigation potential. Practices were assessed twice over 6 - 9 months. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess barriers and opportunities to farmer engagement and on-farm innovation. Farmers were invited to a focus group meeting to network with other farmers and engage with researchers. All farmers participated in the 2 farm assessments, but only half the farmers adopted changes in farm management. All farmers appreciated the RFPA tool, the clearness of the information provided and the focus of the tool on practices directly. The main obstacles to innovation were limited financial capital, lack of trust in government action and confusion over the effectiveness of farm advice on mitigation. The lack of long-term flexibility of agricultural policies and the source of information greatly influenced the acceptance of advice. Results suggest the potential for the expansion of the RFPA tool to include economic assessment of farm practices and the engagement of a larger pool of farmers and farming systems. The tool could be used to support the GHG Action Plan and future environmental policies, and as an integrated self-assessment tool for farmers under Environmental Stewardship Schemes...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} an {{understanding}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> as normative practice clarifies how sustainability is to be understood in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is first approached by investigating its identity. We argue that the economic aspect qualifies and the formative aspect founds the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice. Observing the normativity related to these aspects {{will be the first}} task for the livestock farmer. In addition, we can distinguish conditioning norms applicable to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice which should be observed for competent performance of the practice. Failing to do justice to this normativity might affect the practice's sustainability only in the long term - this is especially the case with conditioning norms. Motives to observe normativity have, therefore, the character of an ultimate conviction regarding the flourishing of the practice. Finally, the sustainability of the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice crucially depends on the broader food system of which it is part...|$|R

It is increasing, and agricultural production systems that were hitherto family-based are increasingly turning to it. Few studies {{have been carried out}} on wage labour in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> Yet it impacts on both the operation and reproduction of <b>livestock</b> <b>farms,</b> and the territorial dynamics in which they interfered. The issue we address here is that of the place of different patterns of wage labour (the term covers indeed several distinct situations) in the sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> and territorial dynamics. To this end we analysed the different types of wage labour in Brazilian Amazonia and compared them with those found in other regions of the world.
