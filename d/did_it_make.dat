500|$|The venture did {{not lose}} money, nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> much, and in July 1938 Gielgud turned to more {{conventional}} West End enterprises, in unconventional circumstances. He directed Spring Meeting, a farce by Perry and Molly Keane, presented by Binkie Beaumont, for whom Perry had just left Gielgud. Somehow the three men remained on excellent terms. In September {{of the same year}} Gielgud appeared in Dodie Smith's sentimental comedy Dear Octopus. The following year he directed and appeared in The Importance of Being Earnest at the Queen's, with Evans playing Lady Bracknell for the first time. They were gratified when Allan Aynesworth, who had played Algernon in the 1895 premiere, said that the new production [...] "caught the gaiety and exactly the right atmosphere.

500|$|The {{amendment}} {{removed the}} stigma of not being considered purebred from American-bred horses. A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses' ancestry {{that it no longer}} made much sense to exclude them. Neither <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> much sense to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration. Weatherby's further amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word [...] "thoroughbred" [...] to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the General Stud Book. In 2006, Blood-Horse Publications, publisher of The Blood-Horse magazine, chose the [...] "repeal" [...] of the Jersey Act as the 39th most important moment in American Thoroughbred horse racing history.|$|E

Lilly was courteous and even affable: but with a curious cold space between him and Aaron. Breakfast passed, and Aaron knew that he must leave. There was something in Lilly's bearing which just showed him the door. In some surprise and confusion, and in some anger, not unmingled with humorous irony, he put his things in his bag. He put on his hat and coat. Lilly was seated rather stiffly writing.|$|E

60|$|Among other ingenious surmises, the {{question}} was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, {{it turned out to}} have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>make</b> a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.|$|E
