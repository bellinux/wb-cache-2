With no takers, he renewed the offer in 1924, when aviation technology had advanced enough {{at that point that}} many people tried for the prize. Most were attempting to fly from New York to Paris, but a number of French aviators planned an attempt to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction, from Paris to New York.|$|E

5|$|Joss {{made his}} major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also {{known as the}} Bluebirds) against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey {{did not make a}} clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never hit the ground.) Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{left for}} basic {{training}} in June 1941. Though {{he intended to}} join the US Marine Corps, he {{signed up for the}} US Navy Flight Training Program, which would allow him to fly for the Marines. On completion of his basic training in November 1941, he was selected as a pilot, and moved to Naval Air Station Atlanta, Georgia in February 1942. He was placed on active duty just before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II. Completing his initial pilot training and transferring to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida for the next phase, he started flight training in the AT-6 Texan. He also qualified to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> N3N Canary trainer aircraft. His final phase of flight lessons occurred in Naval Air Station Miami in Miami, Florida, where he flew the Grumman F3F, a biplane which was the Navy's most advanced trainer at the time. Bolt completed this training on 18 July 1942, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, receiving his aviator wings that day as well.|$|E
5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in flying, and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career flying the F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and flying the F-86 Sabre. During a four-day time period in early 1953, Overton claimed five MiG-15 victories in MiG alley, certifying him as a flying ace. However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories.|$|E

5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|In {{what became}} known as Operation Bolo, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing (8th TFW)—under the command of Colonel Robin Olds—based at Ubon in Thailand, was {{entrusted}} with the task of leading an operation which aimed to lure the North Vietnamese Air Force into an ambush. Accordingly, the F-4 Phantoms of the 8th TFW would <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same profile as an F-105 strike formation, by flying at the same time, altitudes, speed and routes. For the first time, the F-4 Phantoms would be equipped with the QRC-160 jamming pods so they would appear on North Vietnamese radars as F-105 bombers. To prepare for the operation, U.S. aircrews spent several days studying weapons envelopes, pod operation, and all aspects of air-to-air tactics. On 2 January 1967, a total of 56 F-4C Phantom II from the 8th and 366th Tactical Fighter Wings flew in a formation which resembled an F-105 strike force, towards the VPAF’s Phuc Yen Air Base. There were four flights of F-104 fighters flying in escort, to simulate the F-4s.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

5|$|While the 9thDivision {{secured the}} coastal {{region of the}} Huon Peninsula the 7thDivision drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range. The Finisterre Range {{campaign}} began on 17September when the 2/6thIndependent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley. The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> division's 21st and 25thBrigades. Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position. The ridge {{was taken by the}} end of the month, with the RAAF playing a key supporting role. Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21April and secured Madang on 24April.|$|E
5|$|Freese {{emerged as}} a {{potential}} starter when an injury seemed likely to put Cardinals starting third baseman Troy Glaus {{on the disabled list}} {{at the beginning of the}} 2009 season. Freese made his MLB debut on Opening Day of the 2009 season, coming off the bench and hitting a go-ahead sacrifice <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals' home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Freese was expected to be the team's starting third baseman, but was quickly passed over by Brian Barden and Joe Thurston. He was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on April 20, 2009 to make room for newly acquired reliever Blaine Boyer. He later had surgery to repair a left ankle injury that hampered him during spring training. He missed two months of the season. He was activated and assigned to the Springfield Cardinals of the Double-A Texas League in late July, before he was assigned to Memphis. He led the Memphis Redbirds to a PCL division championship. He was recalled in the September call-up on September 23, 2009. Freese played only 17 games for the Cardinals in 2009, in addition to 56 games for Triple-A Memphis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 January, at Wandumi, the main Japanese thrust fell upon the 70-man strong 'A' Company, 2/6th Infantry Battalion. Throughout the day the company fought desperately to hold the Japanese while {{reinforcements}} from the 2/5th were brought up from Wau; in the mid-afternoon, as it looked like they would be overrun, a desperate bayonet charge temporarily bought the Australians some relief and they eventually withdrew about a mile to the south-west, back towards the Bulolo River where they formed a night defensive position, having successfully delayed the Japanese advance and inflicted over 75 killed upon them. Throughout the following day, as poor weather hampered efforts to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2/7th Infantry Battalion, {{a large group of}} about 500 Japanese bypassed 'A' Company's position and continued on towards Wau. In response two companies of the 2/5th were moved to the airstrip, reaching there early on 29 January just before Japanese mortars began firing on it. By mid-morning, however, the weather cleared and Allied aircraft soon began arriving at the airfield, disgorging men from the 2/7th who were quickly thrown into the line. That night several counterattacks were fought off and the following day, as a section of guns from the 2/1st Field Regiment arrived, the 17th Brigade went on the offensive. A company of machine guns from the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was also flown in. By 5 February the Japanese began withdrawing from the area. Significant fighting occurred on 9 February, and {{over the course of the}} next three weeks further clashes took place as the Australians followed up the retreating Japanese. The last actions came around Buibaining and Waipali and by 26 February the withdrawal was complete with the Japanese establishing themselves around Guadagasal and Mubo.|$|E

5|$|Soon, {{they find}} the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and {{capturing}} the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land. Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find the Warring Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky as an ominous Floating Continent. The Returners attempt {{to stop them from}} causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
