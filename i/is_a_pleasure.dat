For Camp, [...] "Mixing Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> because she's a real singer and makes it easy. There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." [...] He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: [...] "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show. I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing. And that makes my job so much easier." ...|$|E

[...] In The New York Times, Hall called Barrymore's {{performance}} [...] "admirable" [...] and wrote that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to see [...] again in something in a lighter vein." [...] The same year, Barrymore starred as jewel thief Baron Felix von Geigern together with Greta Garbo in the 1932 film Grand Hotel, in which Lionel also appeared. Critical opinion of Barrymore's acting was divided; John Gilbert's biographer Eve Golden refers to Barrymore as seeming [...] "more like... affectionate father than her lover", while George Blaisdell of International Photographer praised the dialogue and wrote that a viewer would be [...] "deeply impressed with the rarity in screen drama on which he is looking." [...] Grand Hotel won the Academy Award for Best Picture {{and was one of}} the highest-grossing films of the year. It was later added to the National Film Registry.|$|E

In the league, he {{converted}} his three goals in wins over Osasuna and Valencia, while he scored his two Champions League goals in a 6–2 group stage win over Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb. On 10 December 2011, Benzema scored the opener in Madrid's 3–1 defeat to Barcelona in the El Clásico. The goal, scored just 21 seconds into the match, was the fastest goal ever scored in a match between the two rivals. Three days after his record-breaking goal, for his performances during the 2011 calendar year, Benzema was named the France Football French Player of the Year, beating out Barcelona defender Éric Abidal and Lyon goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. He became only the second French player based in Spain to win the award, and also the second Real Madrid player to capture it. Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to win an individual trophy. When I see the previous winners— Zidane, Henry and other major players— it makes me proud to join them on the list."

[...] Allmusic rated it four stars with {{reviewer}} James Crispell [...] noting: [...] "After so many songs ranging through so many styles, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to have Van Morrison return to the music that suits him so well. Steeped in blues and R, Back on Top finds Morrison celebrating life and its pleasures to the limit." [...] It was rated 3 stars by Rolling Stone with James Hunter ending his review commenting: [...] "Back on Top is solid, brilliant, silly in sad ways. But it's still one Monet and nine Norman Rockwells." [...] Irish critic George Byrne wrote a negative review in the Irish Independent: [...] "Somewhere in the mid-Eighties the poet/philosopher accolades seem to have seeped into his skull and he began churning out same-sounding albums on an almost annual basis." [...] An opposing viewpoint was expressed by George Graham who commented in his review that [...] "It's one of his best, most tasteful albums in recent years, and Van Morrison has had some very good albums in this period." ...|$|E
2500|$|Entertainment Weekly's Stephen Lee gave The Sense of an Ending a B+ {{and said}} [...] "Barnes' latest—a {{meditation}} on memory and aging—occasionally {{feels more like}} a series of wise, underline-worthy insights than a novel. But the many truths he highlights make it worthy of a careful read." [...] Robert McCrum writing for The Observer thought the novel would win the Man Booker Prize because it is [...] "a work of art, in a minor key." [...] During a feature on the 2011 Man Booker Prize nominees, the Channel 4 newsroom team gave The Sense of an Ending a nine out of ten for readability and said [...] "It's beautifully written, very readable, and raises questions which linger in the mind long after the covers are closed." [...] Geordie Williamson from The Australian said the novel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to read and explained there is [...] "a fierce and unforgiving lucidity about The Sense of an Ending, a mature reckoning with ageing that makes its competitors seem petulant and shrill." [...] Geoff Dyer in The New York Times said the novel is average at best. [...] "It is averagely compelling…involves an average amount of concentration and, if such a thing makes sense, is averagely well written: excellent in its averageness!" [...] David Sexton in The Spectator drew a comparison between the narrator of the novel and the [...] "unreliable narrator" [...] of Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, for which – he noted – Barnes wrote an introduction to the Folio Society edition. Although Sexton praised Barnes skill [...] "Yet this novella does not move or satisfy...It is a story repelled by the responsibility of having children, and its final disclosure is offputting....where's the heart?" ...|$|E
