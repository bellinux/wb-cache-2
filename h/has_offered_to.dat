He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and <b>has</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E

If such a deal were struck, though, and South Sudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential trade partner and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South Sudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American companies doing business with Sudan.|$|E

Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States has insisted that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.|$|E

This admittedly results in some complexity in contracting arrangements, which need to be worked out on a case by case basis and depends to some extent on the legal requirements of the countries involved.|$|E
