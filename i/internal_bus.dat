25|$|Although {{it had a}} 32-bit <b>internal</b> <b>bus,</b> the V60 {{had only}} a 16-bit {{external}} data bus and a 24-bit address bus. Its architecture was carried largely intact to the V70 (μPD70632) model, which had external 32-bit buses and was released in 1987. Launched in 1989, the V80 (μPD70832) {{was the culmination of}} the series having on-chip caches, a branch predictor, and less reliance on microcode for complex operations. The V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.|$|E
25|$|The Reston <b>Internal</b> <b>Bus</b> System (RIBS) {{is a set}} of five {{routes that}} {{circulate}} within the community, using Reston Town Center as a transfer point. The fare system is {{the same as that of}} Fairfax Connector. RIBS has been operated for 20 years by Fairfax County's Fairfax Connector bus service. Metrobus service is available to Washington Dulles International Airport from the Herndon Monroe Park and Ride (which is located in Reston), and it is also possible to take routes to the West Falls Church station, which then connects with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.|$|E
50|$|Communications {{between the}} MIPS core, the two VPUs, GIF, memory {{controller}} and other units is handled by a 128-bit wide <b>internal</b> data <b>bus</b> running at half the clock {{frequency of the}} Emotion Engine but, to offer greater bandwidth, {{there is also a}} 128-bit dedicated path between the CPU and VPU0 and a 128-bit dedicated path between VPU1 and GIF. At 150 MHz, the <b>internal</b> data <b>bus</b> provides a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 2.4 GB/s.|$|R

25|$|Most public {{transport}} in Northern Ireland is {{operated by the}} subsidiaries of Translink. Originally the city's <b>internal</b> <b>bus</b> network was run by Ulsterbus, which still provides the city's connections with other towns in Northern Ireland. The city's buses are now run by Ulsterbus Foyle, just as Translink Metro now provides the bus service in Belfast. The Ulsterbus Foyle network offers 13 routes across the city into the suburban areas, excluding an Easibus link which connects to the Waterside and Drumahoe, and a free Rail Link Bus runs from the Waterside Railway Station to the city centre. All buses leave from the Foyle Street Bus Station in the city centre.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} obscure {{design in}} the West, it was {{a radical departure from}} NEC's previous V-series CPUs—the NEC V20-V50 series—, which were based on the Intel x86 model, although it retained the ability to emulate them. According to NEC's documentation, the architectural change was made due to the increasing demand and diversity of programs, calling for a processor with both power (the 32-bit <b>internal</b> <b>bus)</b> and flexibility, having large numbers of general-purpose registers—a common feature of RISC architectures and a benefit to the emerging high-level languages. The V60 architecture retained however CISC features (which its manual describe as mainframe-based) like variable-length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex operand addressing schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Sentosa Monorail {{circled the}} western half of Sentosa until it closed in March 2005. Most {{of the island}} {{monorail}} was dismantled though several of the stations were repurposed for other uses {{and parts of the}} original track structure still remain. The monorail was replaced by the three <b>internal</b> <b>bus</b> lines and the current Sentosa Express, which operates from the main island of Singapore to Sentosa.|$|E
50|$|Communication {{between the}} Emotion Engine and RAM occurs through two {{channels}} of DRDRAM (Direct Rambus Dynamic Random Access Memory) {{and the memory}} controller, which interfaces to the <b>internal</b> data <b>bus.</b> Each channel is 16 bits wide and operates at 400 MHz DDR (Double Data Rate). Combined, the two channels of DRDRAM have a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 25.6 Gbit/s (3.2 GB/s), about 33% more bandwidth than the <b>internal</b> data <b>bus.</b> Because of this, the memory controller buffers data sent from the DRDRAM channels so the extra bandwidth can be utilised by the CPU.|$|R

50|$|The Imagine 128 GPU {{introduced}} a full 128-bit graphics processor—GPU, <b>internal</b> processor <b>bus,</b> and memory bus were all 128 bits. However, there was no, or very little, hardware support for 3D graphics operations.|$|R
2500|$|By that time, Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) had {{developed}} its own network in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, {{and there were}} about 10 routes serving within the district internally, most of them profitable. However, the government introduced {{the concept of the}} [...] "Light Rail Service Area" [...] in both districts, forcing the KMB to withdraw all <b>internal</b> <b>bus</b> services in favour of the Light Rail. It also forced the KMB to impose boarding and alighting restrictions for external routes. It was decided that services between town centres and settlements would be provided solely by the Light Rail, while feeder buses operated by the KCRC would connect remote sites to the network, replacing KMB's equivalent services where applicable.|$|E
2500|$|Tiger Sky Tower (previously {{known as}} the Carlsberg Sky Tower) is a {{free-standing}} observation tower. At a height of [...] above ground and [...] above sea level, it offers visitors {{a panoramic view of}} Sentosa, Singapore, and the Southern Islands. It has a lifting speed of 1.2 metres per second and weighs 200 metric tonnes. On a clear day, the view extends to parts of Malaysia, Johor Bahru (30km / 18 miles), Indonesia, Pulau Bintan (45km / 28 miles) and Pulau Bantan (43km / 27 miles). At ground level, visitors enter a large disc-shaped air-conditioned cabin fitted with glass windows all around. The cabin then revolves slowly as it ascends the column of the tower. The cabin has a capacity of 72 visitors.The Sky Tower now sits at the very spot of what was formerly {{known as the}} Dragon Court. It had a dragon statue as the centerpiece with water spouting from its mouth. In one of its claws, it held a previous logo of Sentosa which was used in the early 1980s. Its tail ended at the Dragon Trail {{in the northern part of}} Imbiah Lookout. The statue was demolished a few months before the groundbreaking ceremony of the Sky Tower.The Sky Tower was officially opened on 7 February 2004, is situated in the Imbiah Lookout zone in the centre of Sentosa and can be reached by Cable Car, Sentosa Luge Chair Lift, the Sentosa Express or by <b>internal</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E

40|$|The IEEE 1149. 4 Standard for a Mixed-Signal (MS) Test Bus proposes an {{extension}} to the well-accepted IEEE 1149. 1 boundary-scan test architecture, {{with the objective}} of facilitating interconnect, parametric and internal testing of MS circuits. An Analog Test Access Port (ATAP) comprising two pins called AT 1 and AT 2, and an <b>internal</b> analog <b>bus</b> (AB) comprising two lines (AB 1, AB 2), enable analog test stimulae and responses to be routed to any pin possessing an Analog Boundary Module (ABMs replace the IEEE 1149. 1 test cells in the case of analog pins). A Test Bus Interface Circuit (TBIC) comprising ten analog switches defines how the ATAP and the <b>internal</b> analog <b>bus</b> are (dis) connected, and the six analog switches in each ABM define what connections should be established between the pin, the core circuitry, and the <b>internal</b> analog <b>bus.</b> The large number of analog switches in the 1149. 4 test architecture may raise concerns about their integrity, particularly when they are used frequently, as would be the case in an 1149. 4 -based MS debug strategy. This paper proposes a set of integrity check procedures that address only the 1149. 4 extensions: ATAP, TBIC, AB lines, ABMs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
