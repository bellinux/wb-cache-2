According to Ashley Jackson's work The British Empire and the Second World War, the Rhodesian Air Training Group instructed 8,235 Allied pilots, navigators, gunners, <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> and others—about 5% of overall EATS output.|$|E

50|$|The second {{mission of}} Camp Kearns was a {{practice}} {{air force base}} for Army Air Corps <b>ground</b> <b>crews.</b> In time, technical training of air force <b>ground</b> <b>crews</b> became Camp Kearns's main objective. This included many kinds of schools: navigation, intelligence, radio, teleprinter, clerical and many others. It was not an air force base with airplanes landing and taking off, <b>ground</b> <b>crews</b> were trained on planes scattered around the base.|$|R

5|$|No.457 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAF Baginton in England on 16June 1941. It was {{equipped}} with Supermarine Spitfires and was the second RAAF fighter unit to be formed in England after No.452 Squadron. The establishment of both these squadrons formed part of an expansion of RAF Fighter Command which sought to improve its ability to defend Britain from a renewed German air offensive and to conduct offensive operations over occupied Europe. At {{the time of its}} formation the squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Peter Malam Brothers, both flight commanders and all members of the <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> were British, but most pilots were Australian. The squadron's <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> component had been formed at RAAF Station Williamtown in Australia on 10June, and departed for England on 7August. On the same day No.457 Squadron moved to RAF Jurby and thence to RAF Andreas, which were both situated on the Isle of Man to undertake training. While at the Isle of Man the squadron trained both its own pilots and pilots from other squadrons for operational duties, and for a time functioned as an operational training unit at RAF Andreas. It also escorted Allied convoys in the Irish Sea, but did not make contact with German aircraft. By October all the British pilots other than Brothers and the flight commanders had been replaced by Australians. The squadron's <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> arrived in Britain during October and November, making it an almost entirely Australian unit.|$|E
5|$|After his capture, the U.S. Army handed Hartmann, his pilots, and <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> {{over to the}} Soviet Union on 14 May, {{where he}} was imprisoned in {{accordance}} with the Yalta Agreements, which stated that airmen and soldiers fighting Soviet forces had to surrender directly to them. Hartmann and his unit were led by the Americans to a large open-air compound to await the transfer. The number of prisoners grew to 50,000. Living conditions deteriorated, and some American guards {{turned a blind eye to}} escapes. In some cases they assisted by providing food and maps.|$|E
5|$|From May 1945 No.75 Squadron {{participated in}} the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> landed on Tarakan with the {{invasion}} force in early May 1945, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not be deployed there until mid-July rather than 3May as had been originally planned. During this period No.75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline. Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's last weeks.|$|E

50|$|Generally, fire retardants are {{dropped from}} {{aircraft}} or applied by <b>ground</b> <b>crews</b> around a wildfire's edges {{in an effort}} to contain its spread. This allows <b>ground</b> <b>crews</b> time to work to extinguish the fire. However, when needed, retardant can also be dropped directly onto flames to cool the fire and reduce flame length.|$|R

5|$|Just {{before the}} end of {{hostilities}} in the Pacific, the recently established garrison headquarters No.11 Group unofficially directed the wing's operations. Following the Japanese surrender in September 1945, No.82 Wing's Liberators were converted to transports and used to repatriate RAAF personnel from the South West Pacific. Over the course of its wartime existence, the wing's personnel numbered between 3,000 and 5,000, of whom more than half were <b>ground</b> <b>crew.</b> Along with its flying squadrons, its complement included No.24 Air Stores Park, No.6 Repair and Servicing Unit, and No.30 Medical Clearing Station.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the <b>ground</b> <b>crew,</b> especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|While {{aircraft}} {{were being}} delivered, Bowen, Tizard and Watt pressed the Air Ministry to appoint someone {{to command the}} entire night fighting system, from ensuring aircraft delivery and radar production to the training of pilots and <b>ground</b> <b>crew.</b> This {{led to the formation}} of the Night Interception Committee (so-named in July 1940) under the direction of Richard Peirse. Peirse raised the Night Interception Unit at RAF Tangmere on 10 April 1940; it was later renamed the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU).|$|E

5|$|XX Bomber Command was {{assigned}} responsibility for Operation Matterhorn, and its <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> began {{to leave the}} United States for India during December 1943. The Twentieth Air Force was formed in April 1944 to oversee all B-29 operations. In an unprecedented move, {{the commander of the}} USAAF, General Henry H. Arnold, took personal command of this unit and ran it from the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The 58th Bombardment Wing was XXBomber Command's main combat unit, and its movement from Kansas to India took place between April and mid-May 1944.|$|E
5|$|After being {{concentrated}} at Yagodnik, {{the attack}} force was readied to strike Kaafjord. The Soviet personnel at the airfield provided considerable assistance, {{but the process}} of refuelling the aircraft could not be completed until 13 September due to inadequate facilities. The <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> also repaired some of the damaged bombers, including with parts salvaged from the aircraft which had been written off. The British officers and senior non-commissioned officers were accommodated in a boat, and all other personnel slept in overcrowded underground huts. Both the boat and the huts were infested with bed bugs, {{and almost all of}} the airmen were bitten before the accommodation was fumigated by the detachment's medical officer.|$|E
5|$|By 7 March, the Seabees had the Momote {{airfield}} ready. Artillery spotting aircraft began {{operating from}} the strip on 6 March and a B-25 made {{an emergency landing}} the next day. Guided by a B-25, twelve P-40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron RAAF arrived from Kiriwina via Finschhafen on 9March, the remaining twelve aircraft of the squadron following the next day. They were joined by the <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> of No. 77 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived by LST on 6March. The rest of No.73 Wing RAAF arrived {{over the next two}} weeks, including the Kittyhawks of No.77 Squadron RAAF and Supermarine Spitfires of No. 79 Squadron RAAF. Operations began on 10 March and henceforth ships and ground units in the Admiralties had air support just minutes away.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} {{by the fall of}} that year, but other parts of the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport was lacking fire fighting equipment and <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used as terminal.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{spent the}} winter of 1939–40 gaining as much flight {{practice}} as possible. He was unable to gain any hours in fighter aircraft and was abruptly transferred to the practice and parachute test flight centre at RAF Henlow and {{had to settle for}} making trips around airfields in an antiquated Vickers Virginia as a co-pilot ferrying engineers and <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> from 16 September 1939. That month German forces invaded Poland (1 September) prompting Britain and France to declare war on Germany and beginning the war in Europe. Finucane's piloting skills were far from being at the acceptable level for a fighter pilot. He continued in this trend until May 1940 until he was assigned to flying Miles Magister training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's victim was most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's victim was passed on to a member of the <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron {{personnel}} were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own <b>ground</b> <b>crew.</b> No. 450 Squadron moved to Rayak airfield, Lebanon, {{where it was}} allocated Hurricanes and Miles Magister trainers. A batch of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to Burg El Arab, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, {{taking part in the}} North African Campaign.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft. The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's <b>ground</b> <b>crew</b> managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
