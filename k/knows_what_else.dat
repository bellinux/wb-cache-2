500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment {{you turn on the}} game, that knights, wizards, goblins and who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> are about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E

He wrote that he would work on translations of Maria Padilla and Linda di Chamounix and [...] "God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> I'll do". During the time in Naples, his poor health was again a problem causing him to remain in bed for days at a time.|$|E

That phrase {{ought to be}} translated by a Western acquaintance of mine--one Haze Ruff. I'd not like to hurt your sensitive feelings with what he'd say. But this unrest means speed-mad, excitement-mad, fad-mad, dress-mad, or I should say undress-mad, culture-mad, and Heaven only <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else.</b> The women of our set are idle, luxurious, selfish, pleasure-craving, lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good." ...|$|E

The whole thing is appalling, and yet the people are getting apparently more helpless to reform it. Laws pile upon laws, when the real reform is to abolish laws. Wipe out grants and special privileges. We ought to be legislating toward equality of opportunity in the world, and here we go with McKinley bills, and the devil <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else.</b> By the way, to change the subject, what has become of Milton Jennings?

60|$|The {{malignant}} attack {{recently made}} upon Mr. Jump's catches of Marlin swordfish on light tackle was uncalled for and utterly false. It {{was an obvious}} and jealous attempt to belittle, discredit, and dishonor {{one of the finest}} gentlemen sportsmen who ever worked {{for the good of the}} game. I know and I will swear that Jump's capture of the three-hundred-and-fourteen-pound Marlin on light tackle in twenty-eight minutes was absolutely as honest as it was skilful, as sportsman-like as it was wonderful. A number of well-known sportsmen watched him take this Marlin. Yet his enemies slandered him, accused him of using ropes and Heaven <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else!</b> It was vile and it failed.|$|E

We have no foolish ideas about wealth, but comfort is another matter, and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that--and not a penniless adventurer, a sailor, a cowboy, a smuggler, and Heaven <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else,</b> who, in addition to everything, is hare-brained and irresponsible." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{should like}} to have heard Mark's version of that, with some stories of his joyous and {{variegated}} past. He has been journeyman printer (in those days he wandered from {{the banks of the}} Missouri even to Philadelphia), pilot cub and full-blown pilot, soldier of the South (that was for three weeks only), private secretary to a Lieutenant-Governor of Nevada (that displeased him), miner, editor, special correspondent in the Sandwich Islands, and the Lord only <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else.</b> If so experienced a man could by any means be made drunk, it would be a glorious thing to fill him up with composite liquors, and, in the language of his own country, [...] "let him retrospect."

6000|$|... "Wait,--I'm coming on,--you'll hear. The {{short of}} the matter is, cousin," [...] said he, his {{handsome}} face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression, [...] "on this abstract question of slavery there can, as I think, be but one opinion. Planters, who have money to make by it,--clergymen, who have planters to please,--politicians, who want to rule by it,--may warp and bend language and ethics {{to a degree that}} shall astonish the world at their ingenuity; they can press nature and the Bible, and nobody <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else,</b> into the service; but, after all, neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more. It comes from the devil, that's the short of it;--and, to my mind, it's a pretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line." ...|$|E

6000|$|The mad {{excitement}} {{of that day}} in New York is a faint memory now, so much has Honora lived since then. We descendants of rigid Puritans, of pioneer tobacco-planters and frontiersmen, take naturally to a luxury {{such as the world}} has never seen--as our right. We have abolished kings, in order that as many of us as possible may abide in palaces. In one day Honora forgot the seventeen years spent in the [...] "little house under the hill," [...] as though these had never been. Cousin Eleanor, with a delightful sense of wrong-doing, yielded to the temptation to adorn her; and the saleswomen, who knew Mrs. Hanbury, made indiscreet-remarks. Such a figure and such a face, and just enough of height! Two new gowns were ordered, to be tried on at Sutcliffe, and as many hats, and an ulster, and heaven <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else.</b> Memory fails.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{the most}} ridiculous thing I ever heard of in my life," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "A man that lives by himself in a place down by the Riverside Road like a toy savings bank--don't you know the things I mean?--called Sallust's House, {{says there is a}} right of way through our new {{pleasure}} ground. As if anyone could have any right there after all the money we have spent fencing it on three sides, and building up the wall by the road, and levelling, and planting, and draining, and goodness <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else!</b> And now the man says that all the common people and tramps in the neighborhood have a right to walk across it because they are too lazy to go round by the road. Sir Charles has gone to see the man about it. Of course he wouldn't do as I wanted him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be not afraid, my man of threats," [...] he said pleasantly. [...] "I have {{no thought}} of hurting you--leastways, not yet." [...] He {{paused in the}} act of {{breaking}} the seal. [...] "Lest you should treasure uncomfortable delusions, dear Master Stewart, let me remind you that I am an Irishman--not a fool. Do you conceive my fame to be so narrow a thing that when I left the beggarly army of King Charles for that of the Commonwealth, I did not realize how at any moment I might {{come face to face with}} someone who had heard of my old exploits, and would denounce me? You do not find me masquerading under an assumed name. I am here, sir, as Harry Hogan, a sometime dissolute follower of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Charles Stuart; an erstwhile besotted, blinded soldier in the army of the Amalekite, a whilom erring malignant, but converted by a crowning mercy into a zealous, faithful servant of Israel. There were vouchsafings and upliftings, and the devil <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else,</b> when this stray lamb was gathered to the fold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a ticklish business," [...] said Burke, [...] "but I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> can be done. It {{is a great}} pity I didn't know he {{was going}} to {{surrender}} when we had that fight." ...|$|R
