40|$|Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) {{is one of}} {{the kind}} of Bin Packing Problem (BPP). CSP {{contains}} different sized stock categories, which is a more general problem than BPP.

In this paper, a new revised algorithm for <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> method is proposed. <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> method takes an approach to assign products to the good fitting bin, which sometimes causes bad yield rate at the final assignment.

30|$|The {{observation}} in point 3 can be modeled as <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> Decreasing algorithm. We choose a host from the hostlist (starting {{from the very}} first position) and check whether the host is suitable for the VM. If the host is suitable then we pour the VM into that host and check for the next VM from the VMlist. If the host is not suitable than we move onto the next host from the hostlist. Considering this we propose a VM placement algorithm which we name as MFFDVP (modified <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> decreasing VM placement). As this algorithm is almost identical with our lastt algorithm, we skip describing its pseudo code and move toward the next point. Let us consider the point 4. Now we can see that it is a representation of modified <b>first</b> <b>fit</b> technique where hosts are decreasingly sorted with respected to their available power. So for this case, each VM will be first allocated to the host which has maximum available power, then after allocating the VM, the hostlist will be decreasingly sorted again (when the next VM is called), and in this manner it will continue allocating VMs until allocation for all the VMs from the VM migration list is done; when one host reaches close to its maximum power, the next host from the hostlist will be called. We named it FFDHDVP (<b>first</b> <b>fit</b> decreasing with decreasing host VM placement). The pseudo-code for the algorithm is presented in Algorithm 4.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{processing}} {{demand on}} multi-tasking real-time {{systems can be}} met by employing scalable multi-core architectures. For such environments, locking cache lines for hard real-time systems ensures timing predictability of data references and may lower worst-case execution time. This work studies the benefits of cache locking on massive multicore architectures with private caches {{in the context of}} hard real-time sys-tems. In shared cache architectures, the cache is a single resource shared among all the tasks. However, in scalable cache architectures with private caches, conflicts exist only among the tasks scheduled on one core. This calls for a cache-aware allocation of tasks onto cores. The objective of this work is to increase the predictability of memory accesses resolved by caches while reducing the number of cores for a given task set. This allows designers to reduce the footprint of their subsystem of real-time tasks and thereby cost, either by choosing a product with fewer cores as a target or to allow more subsystems to be co-located on a given fixed number of cores. Our work proposes a novel variant of the cache-unaware <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> Decreasing (FFD) algorithm called Naive locked <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> Decreasing (NFFD) policy. We propose two cache-aware static scheduling schemes: (1) Greedy <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> Decreasing (GFFD) and (2) Colored <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> Decreasing (CoFFD) for task sets where tasks do not have intra-task conflicts among locked regions (Scenario A).

40|$|Dynamic Bin Packing (DBP) is {{a variant}} of {{classical}} bin packing, which assumes that items may arrive and depart at arbitrary times. Existing works on DBP generally aim to minimize {{the maximum number of}} bins ever used in the packing. In this paper, we consider {{a new version of the}} DBP problem, namely, the MinTotal DBP problem which targets at minimizing the total cost of the bins used over time. It is motivated by the request dispatching problem arising in cloud gaming systems. We analyze the competitive ratios of the commonly used <b>First</b> <b>Fit,</b> Best Fit, and Any Fit packing (the family of packing algorithms that open a new bin only when no currently opened bin can accommodate the item to be packed) algorithms for the MinTotal DBP problem. We show that the competitive ratio of Any Fit packing cannot be better than the max/min item interval length ratio μ. The competitive ratio of Best Fit packing is not bounded for any given μ. For <b>First</b> <b>Fit</b> packing, if all the item sizes are smaller than W k (W is the bin capacity and k> 1 is a constant), it has a competitive ratio of k k− 1 ·μ+ 6 kk− 1 + 1.
