50|$|The Ecodesign Directive is a {{framework}} directive, {{meaning that it}} does not directly set minimum ecological requirements. These are adopted through specific implementing measures for each group of products in the scope of the Directive. The implementing measures are adopted through the so-called comitology procedure. Implementing measures are based on EU internal market rules governing which products may be placed on the market. Manufacturers who begin marketing an energy using product covered by an <b>implementing</b> <b>measure</b> in the EU area have to ensure that it conforms to the energy and environmental standards set out by the measure.|$|E

This paper will focus on the central scope and definition questions for the existing standby and off-mode regulation, and address the complications with adding network functionality to the scope of regulation...|$|E

40|$|This article {{uses the}} recent {{drive in the}} UK to abolish {{gold-plating}} {{as a starting point}} to analyse whether EU legislation on prospectus disclosure, transparency requirements, and market abuse provides for maximum harmonisation or allows Member States to adopt super-equivalent <b>implementing</b> <b>measure.</b> In addition, the article develops a number of general criteria to identify situations where maximum harmonisation may be beneficial, and cases where the setting of minimum standards, or merely the removal of obstacles to cross-border mobility, is advantageous. The article argues that prospectus disclosure entails largely maximum harmonisation. The character of the Transparency and Market Abuse Directives, on the other hand, is ambivalent. Recent case law calls into question the permissibility of the super-equivalent implementation of the Market Abuse Directive by UK law. As far as the benefits of harmonisation are concerned, the article distinguishes between disclosure obligations and liability provisions. It is submitted that harmonisation is beneficial with respect to the latter, but should be scrutinized carefully in case of the former...|$|E

40|$|Essent {{operates}} a coal-fired power plant, called AC- 9, in Geertruidenberg. A gasifier connected to AC- 9 thermally treats waste wood through gasification. The waste wood Essent used is demolition and construction wood, the so-called B-wood. The gas produced through gasification is {{fed into the}} connected AC- 9 where it is used as fuel. However, after the BVA’s (Besluit Verbranden Afvalstoffen) entry into force, Essent had to stop the gasification of waste wood and the subsequent use of the resulting gas as fuel. The BVA is the Dutch <b>implementing</b> <b>measure</b> of the Waste Incineration Directive (Directive 2000 / 76 /EC, WID). According to the BVA, any power plant co-incinerating products of thermal treatment of waste {{is regarded as a}} co-incineration plant irrespective {{of the quality of the}} product. In the case of a power plant connected to a gasifier, the BVA treats the whole plant as a co-incineration plant. This raises the question of whether the plant of Essent, which is treated as a co-incineration plant by the BVA, is regarded as a co-incineration plant by the WID as well. To answer the question, first, the report dealt with the highly complicated issue of what constitutes waste. Second, it studied how the WID defines incineration and co-incineration plant. Third, it analysed the consistency of the BVA with the WID and the EC Treaty. Fourth, to find out whether the purified producer gas from the gasifier can be characterized as a ‘clean’ secondary fuel on which the BEES (Besluiten emissie-eisen stookinstallaties A en B) should be applicable, the properties of the gas were examined and compared with the properties of clean biomass. The report also investigated how the emissions per generated MJ looked like if the power plant is fired on only coal and on a combination of coal and producer gas. Finally, the criteria distilled from the case law of the European Court of Justice were applied to the producer gas of Essent. ...|$|E

40|$|The Motor Challenge Programme (MCP) is a {{voluntary}} commitment scheme {{launched by the}} European Commission {{at the beginning of}} 2003 to activate European companies to implement energy efficiency measures for motors. Transforming electrical into mechanical power, electrical motors are central devices in modern industrial production. Moving drivers, fans, compressors and pumps these motors are essential for assuring the continuous creation of a multitude of products and services important to our life such as food, beverages, cars, furniture, textiles, consumer electronics, water and energy supply. Motor driven systems account for 30 % of electricity use in the European Union and for 60 % of industrial electricity use constituting therefore a major and relevant area for energy efficiency improvements. Many studies showed that the potential for energy savings is substantial. By the end of 2009, the MCP comprised a total of 93 companies coming from a surprising wide range of industrial sectors with the focus on production and processing originating from 16 countries in the European Union. Only a handful came from service related sectors. The largest groups of MCP partners came from food production (13 %), metal and steel (12 %) and water supply (9 %). Micro and small sized companies were in the minority, whereas the largest proportion was either medium or large size companies. In total all MCP measures resulted in an estimated annual energy saving of 183, 300 MWh and savings of 87, 250 tons of carbon emissions per year, which represents an estimated 0. 02 % reduction of the total energy consumption in EU 27 ¿s industry. The scheme received a highly positive judgement by MCP Partners itself. 41 % of the responses saw MCP as instrumental in convincing the company to implement energy efficiency measures. More than 70 % of the MCP companies questioned have energy reduction goals and policies in place, more than 50 % an energy management team or department. MCP was seen as underlining and supporting the companies strive towards more energy efficiency and 92 % want to continue investing into energy efficient motors. The key drivers for <b>implementing</b> <b>measure</b> was seen in economic savings, the majority was satisfied with the results achieved under MCP. This catalogue presents a selection of MCP Partners, the measures taken and results achieved. JRC. DDG. F. 8 -Renewable Energy (Ispra...|$|E
