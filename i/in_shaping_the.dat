5|$|He drew two unusual {{assignments}} in 1934. When the USAAC took over flying the air mail, McClelland acted as zone communications officer at Salt Lake City. Later in the year, he was communications and meteorological officer for General Henry H. Arnold's Alaskan flight, {{which was to}} do much <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> trend of air communications.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{growth and}} forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to view Tolkien's own {{experiences}} during World War I as instrumental <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> story. The author's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences.|$|E

5|$|The blown-off {{outer layers}} of dying stars include heavy elements, {{which may be}} {{recycled}} during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets.

5|$|Whales {{played a}} major part <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> art forms of many coastal civilizations, such as the Norse, with some dating to the Stone Age. Petroglyphs off a cliff face in Bangudae, South Korea show 300 depictions of various animals, a third of which are whales. Some show {{particular}} detail {{in which there are}} throat pleats, typical of rorquals. These petroglyphs show these people, of around 7,000 to 3,500 B.C.E. in South Korea, had a very high dependency on whales.|$|E
5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> land that makes up the park today.|$|E

5|$|Although only an {{alternate}} {{member of the}} tribunal without a vote, his voice was heard {{in all of its}} deliberations, his hand drafted a large and most important part of its judgment, and no one connected with the tribunal, member or otherwise, had a greater part than he <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> final result. If, as I confidently believe, the work of the tribunal will constitute a landmark in the development of world order based on law, to Norman Birkett must go a large share of the credit for the success of the undertaking. To few men does the opportunity come to labour so mightily for the welfare of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects. He was instrumental <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> city of Christchurch's unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect of the developing province of Canterbury. Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Deady {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. The convention {{was held in the}} territorial capital of Salem to prepare the territory for statehood. He became president of the body and was influential <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> new state constitution, which outlawed slavery but excluded African-Americans from settling in the new state. Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed state education in all forms. During the debates Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1995, the band {{underwent}} changes on the business side. Manager Ron Lafitte was hired by EMI Records and essentially disbanded his management company. Megadeth later signed with ESP Management and hired Bud Prager, a previous manager of Foreigner and Bad Company, to be the band's new creative manager. As with Max Norman before him, Prager {{would go on to}} be highly influential <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> direction of the band. In an interview for Hard Rock Examiner, Mustaine revealed that {{there is a possibility that}} Megadeth are going to perform the album in its entirety in 2014, honoring the 20-year anniversary of the record's release.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E

5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> church's doctrines and practices—it {{was influenced}} by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were {{played out in the}} Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a conflict that {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism. Conservatives dissatisfied with liberal trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the last}} incarcerees left in 1945, former incarcerees {{and others have}} worked to protect Manzanar and to {{establish}} it as a National Historic Site {{to ensure that the}} history of the site, along with the stories of those who were unjustly incarcerated there, are remembered by current and future generations. The primary focus is the Japanese American incarceration era, as specified in the legislation that created the Manzanar National Historic Site. The site also interprets the former town of Manzanar, the ranch days, the settlement by the Owens Valley Paiute, and the role that water played <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> history of the Owens Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring {{weaknesses}} in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces {{found it impossible}} to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the Rowell-Sirois Commission. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald played an important role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> Commission's final recommendations.|$|E

5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, {{the rules of engagement}} established under Deny Flight also played an important role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> rules of engagement for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing play a significant role <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> landscape.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say <b>in</b> <b>shaping</b> <b>the</b> final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E
