40|$|What are {{economic}} exchanges? The received {{view has}} it that exchanges are mutual transfers of goods motivated by inverse valuations thereof. As a corollary, the standard approach treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services as a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods. We raise two objections against this standard approach. First, it is incomplete, as it fails to take into account, among other things, the offers and acceptances that lie {{at the core of}} even the simplest cases <b>of</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Second, it ultimately fails to generalize to <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services, in which neither inverse preferences nor mutual transfers hold true. We propose an alternative definition <b>of</b> <b>exchanges,</b> which treats <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods as a special case <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services and which builds in offers and acceptances. According to this theory: (i) The valuations motivating exchanges are propositional and convergent rather than objectual and inverse; (ii) All <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> goods involve <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> services/actions, but not the reverse; (iii) Offers and acceptances, together with the contractual obligations and claims they bring about, {{lie at the heart of}} all cases <b>of</b> <b>exchange...</b>|$|R

We also separately measure the net <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> skills embodied in vertical and horizontal intra-industry trade (IIT). We find that there are substantial factor exchanges involved in IIT, implying that traditional fac-tor content studies may have seriously underestimated the actual factor content of total trade flows. This means that the adjustment effects of IIT may be greater than is often presumed. We also find, in line with theory, that vertical IIT involves simi-lar net <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> labour of different skills to that of inter-industry trade, while horizontal IIT involves much smaller net <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> skills.

5|$|The American effort {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} soon outstripped the British as the American authorities {{were reluctant to}} share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access {{to all of the}} information available. They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} works {{attributed}} to the trobairitz is estimated at thirty-two songs, but ranges anywhere from 23 to 46. There {{are a number of}} reasons why an exact number is not known. In the courtly love tradition it was common for poems to be written as an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> letters, or a debate, as in a tenso. Some of these may have been originally written by one poet; however, some were originally an actual <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> epistles, later gathered together in a manuscript. Some of these were between men, and some were {{between a man and a}} woman. Some modern editors attribute these solely to the man who originated the exchange, and some attribute them to both the man and the woman involved. There is a long history of attributing these solely to men, even when all evidence points to the contrary.|$|E
