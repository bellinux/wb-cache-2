25|$|The current {{commercial}} {{systems are}} aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. <b>Key</b> <b>distribution</b> by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This {{has the advantage}} of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of large capacity portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (Quantum <b>Key</b> <b>Distribution)</b> systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In IEEE INFOCOM 2004, Chan {{proposed}} a distributed key management scheme for mobile ad hoc networks, and deduced the condition {{under which the}} key sets distributed to the network nodes can form a cover-free family (CFF), which is the precondition that the scheme can work.

25|$|Quantum {{communication}} involves encoding {{information in}} quantum states, or qubits, {{as opposed to}} classical communication's use of bits.

There are several different approaches to quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{but they can be}} divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit.|$|E

25|$|Quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{only used}} to produce and {{distribute}} a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen encryption algorithm to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard communication channel. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the one-time pad, as it is provably secure when used with a secret, random key. In real-world situations, it is often also used with encryption using symmetric key algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm.|$|E
30|$|After {{finishing}} {{mutual authentication}} process, the proposed connectivity architecture performs two-phase <b>key</b> seed <b>distribution.</b> Basically, after distributing 255 seed {{values in the}} existing method, these values were performed XOR operation to generate the link encryption key of 128 [*]bits. However, the existing method have some problems such as key seeds are sent to a node as a plaintext and all key seed values (maximum 255 seeds) should be guaranteed their successful transmission each time without loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two-phase <b>key</b> seed <b>distribution</b> approaches called quick and main mode. In case of quick mode, it can provide DoS resilient capability {{because it does not}} need to send maximum 255 key seeds every time. And a main mode can provide the confidentiality of the key seed values using all different seed encryption keys. Current RF 4 CE standard does not provide any protection during <b>key</b> seed <b>distribution,</b> while our protocol provides the secure protection for the initial <b>key</b> seed <b>distribution.</b> In the pairing phase (Figure 5), controller device can verify target's certificate and obtain the public key of the target. Anyone who eavesdrop the communication cannot know or modify SEK_R since SEK_R is encrypted with accompanying hashed value. The message from controller device can be easily authenticated by target's private key, while previous methods do not provide the message authentication in this phase.|$|R

25|$|Several other attacks {{including}} faked-state attacks, phase remapping attacks, and time-shift {{attacks are}} now known. The time-shift attack {{has even been}} demonstrated on a commercial quantum cryptosystem. This is the first demonstration of quantum hacking against a non-homemade quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> system. Later on, the phase-remapping attack was also demonstrated on a specially configured, research oriented open QKD system (made and provided by the Swiss company Id Quantique under their Quantum Hacking program).

25|$|The quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> {{protocols}} {{described above}} provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, {{and also with}} {{an estimate of the}} discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as information reconciliation and privacy amplification respectively, and were first described in 1992.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} and unique property of quantum <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is the ability}} of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.|$|E
