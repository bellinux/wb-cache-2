I investigate the impact of real flexibility on firms 2 ̆ 7 <b>finance</b> <b>capacity,</b> namely, their ability to obtain debt, borrow long-term and issue public debt. I test whether real flexibility improves <b>finance</b> <b>capacity</b> by lowering the probability of failure, curbing debt overhang and enhancing the collateral value of assets, or impairs <b>finance</b> <b>capacity</b> by enabling shareholders to risk-shift through risky production plans or asset substitution. I measure real flexibility as the sensitivity of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s marginal production and investment decisions to variations in the economic environment given technology in place. I find that, overall, financial leverage and debt maturity are negatively related to real flexibility, consistent with flexibility facilitating shareholder opportunism. In contrast flexibility improves access to public debt markets and reduces reliance on bank loans, suggesting that real flexibility is a partial substitute for the ex post flexible terms of monitored debt However, based on an analysis of covariance, I find only a weak economic role for flexibility and traditional determinants of financial structure. ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{a number}} of catch share {{programs}} do include financing options for small businesses and new entrants, some fishing communities, academics, journalists, and nonprofit organizations have claimed that catch shares serve as a mechanism for the consolidation of fishing rights, often by corporations with better <b>financing</b> <b>capacity</b> than independent fishermen. New institutions are being developed to improve communities' access to shares, allow new entrants into the fishery, and/or keep quota within the community. They include the {{development and use of}} permit banks, community license banks and Community Fishing Associations. Programs' design features, including concentration caps, owner-on-board regulations, and trading restrictions, can be used to help alleviate potential unwanted social outcomes. However, it is argued the measures have only mitigated, not prevented, the undesirable social and economic outcomes that accompany catch share programs.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the expressive changes in global economy those happen from the end of 20 th century the structure of the national economy’s sectors internally the structure of the ventures changes also. The (capital) resource gap {{is said to be the}} most common obstacle to development and growth by the small- and medium-size enterprises. In the course of the research of corporate capital structure we’ve come to the conclusion that the characteristic method of solving the (capital) resource gap is the use of external capital, internally the most dominant was bank credit and trade credit. However the biggest part of the trade credit comes not from regular operating in the market, but is the consequence of the growth of gridlock, and the slackening solvency. Our model calculations for the relationship of the weighted average cost of capital (the profit-earning capacity of the assets) and the financial leverage prove that most of the enterprises don’t give proper attention to the basic principles of <b>financing</b> (profit-earning <b>capacity,</b> safety, elasticity, liquidity). If the use of external capital sources is not in proportion to the profit-earning capacity of the enterprise, the slackening of capital efficiency reduces the self <b>financed</b> <b>capacity</b> even more, so it increases the financial and the operating leverage, worsen its negative effects. The choice of the financing strategy is conscious only at a few enterprises, so negative effects coming from the difference between the terms structures of the assets and resources appear more than the positive. forráshiány, hitelösszetétel, finanszírozási stratégia, lack of capital, share of credits, financial strategies, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Financial Economics,...|$|R

40|$|Water {{supply and}} demand {{planning}} is often conducted independently {{of social and economic}} strategies. There are presently no comprehensive life-cycle approaches to modelling urban water balances that incorporate economic feedbacks, such as tariff adjustment, which can in turn create a <b>financing</b> <b>capacity</b> for investment responses to low reservoir levels. This paper addresses this gap, and presents a system dynamics model that augments the usual water utility representation of the physical linkages of water grids, by adding inter-connected feedback loops in tariff structures, demand levels and <b>financing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The model, applied in the south-east Queensland region in Australia, enables simulation of alternatives and analysis of stocks and flows around a grid or portfolio of bulk supplies including an increasing proportion of rain-independent desalination plants. Such rain-independent water production plants complement the rain-dependent sources in the region and can potentially offer indefinite water security at a price. The study also shows how an alternative temporary drought pricing regime not only defers costly bulk supply infrastructure but actually generates greater price stability than traditional pricing approaches. The model has implications for water supply planners seeking to pro-actively plan, justify and finance portfolios of rain-dependent and rain-independent bulk water supply infrastructure. Interestingly, the modelling showed that a temporary drought pricing regime not only lowers the frequency and severity of water insecurity events but also reduces the long-run marginal cost of water supply for the region when compared to traditional reactive planning approaches that focus on restrictions to affect demand in scarcity periods.
