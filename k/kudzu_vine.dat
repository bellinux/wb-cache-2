2500|$|Kudzu is a {{perennial}} vine native to Asia, primarily subtropical and temperate regions of China, Japan, and Korea, [...] with trifoliate leaves composed of three leaflets. Five {{species in the}} genus Pueraria (P. montana, P. lobata, P. edulis, P. phaseoloides and P. thomsoni) are closely related and kudzu populations in the United States seem to have ancestry {{from more than one}} of the species. Each leaflet is large and ovate with two to three lobes each and hair on the underside. The leaves have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can supply up to 95% of leaf nitrogen to the plant in poor soils. [...] Along the vines are nodes, points at which stems or tendrils can propagate to increase support and attach to structures. [...] As a twining vine, kudzu uses stems or tendrils that can extend from any node on the vine to attach to and climb most surfaces. In addition, the nodes of the <b>kudzu</b> <b>vine</b> have the ability to root when exposed to soil, further anchoring the vine to the ground. The roots are tuberous and are high in starch and water content, and the twining of the plant allows for less carbon concentration in the construction of woody stems and greater concentration in roots, which aids root growth. The roots can account for up to 40% of total plant biomass.|$|E

50|$|Since 1998, the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has {{experimented with}} using M. verrucaria as a biologically-based {{herbicide}} against <b>kudzu</b> <b>vines.</b> A spray based on M. verrucaria works under {{a variety of}} conditions (including the absence of dew), causes minimal injury to many of the other woody plants in kudzu-infested habitats, and takes effect fast enough that kudzu treated with it in the morning starts showing evidence of damage by mid-afternoon. Initial formulations of the herbicide produced toxic levels of trichothecene as a byproduct, though the ARS discovered that growing M. verrucaria in a fermenter on a liquid instead of a solid diet limited or eliminated the problem.|$|R
25|$|For {{successful}} long-term {{control of}} kudzu, {{it is not}} necessary to destroy the underground system, which can be extremely large and deep. It is only necessary to use some method to kill or remove the kudzu root crown and all rooting runners. The root crown is a fibrous knob of tissue that sits on top of the roots. Crowns form from multiple vine nodes that root to the ground, and range from pea- to basketball-sized. The older the crowns, the deeper they tend to be found in the ground. Nodes and crowns are the source of all <b>kudzu</b> <b>vines,</b> and roots cannot produce vines. If any portion of a root crown remains after attempted removal, the kudzu plant may grow back.|$|R

50|$|Both local {{shipping}} and long-distance trade {{are required to}} meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gases and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments.

Introduced or alien species are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the new environment where they are introduced.

40|$|Abstract. The {{prevalence}} of obligate parasitic fungi may depend {{partly on the}} environmental conditions prevailing in the habitats of their hosts. Ectoparasitic fungi of the order Laboulbeniales (Ascomycetes) infect arthropods and form thalli on the host’s body surface. Although several studies report the incidence of infection of certain host species by these fungi, quantitative data on laboulbenialean fungus-host arthropod interactions at the host assemblage level are rarely reported. To clarify the effects of host habitats on infection by ectoparasitic fungi, the incidence of infection by fungi of the genus Laboulbenia (Laboulbeniales) of overwintering carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in three habitats, a riverside (reeds and vines), a secondary forest and farmland (rice and vegetable fields), were compared in central Japan. Of the 531 adults of 53 carabid species (nine subfamilies) collected in the three habitats, a Laboulbenia infection of one, five and one species of the carabid subfamilies Pterostichinae, Harpalinae and Callistinae, respectively, was detected. Three species of fungus were identified: L. coneglanensis, L. pseudomasei and L. fasciculate. The incidence of infection by Laboulbenia was higher in the riverside habitat (8. 97 % of individuals; 14 / 156) than in the forest (0. 93 %; 2 / 214) and farmland (0 %; 0 / 161) habitats.

Phenology of kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) along a ∼ 800 km transect in the U. S. was characterized in 2003 and 2004 to assess the potential for kudzu {{to serve as an}} inoculum source for occurrence of ASR and subsequent spread to the north central soybean growing regions. Also, the occurrence, distribution, and growing periods of six potential hosts of P. pachyrhizi (including kudzu and soybean), in Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico, were delineated. Sampling data revealed that bud break of kudzu plants in the two consecutive years of study occurred as early as April 7 from southern Louisiana (29. 8 N latitude) to northern Mississippi (35. 0 N latitude); kudzu green leaf area index decreased linearly with increasingly northern latitude (R 2 and regression coefficient = 0. 750 2 ̆ 6 [...] 0. 097, respectively, for 2003 and 0. 654 2 ̆ 6 [...] 0. 384 for 2004). Further, results of modeling predicted that in southern Mississippi (31. 5 N latitude), kudzu plants broke dormancy in the second and first week of March in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Modeling also showed that <b>kudzu</b> <b>vines</b> may break dormancy prior to March 1 st in areas of southern and central Florida and southern Louisiana.

50|$|Common {{beans in}} {{moderate}} temperature regions {{are victims of}} halo blights. Main hosts are lima beans, red kidney bean, cranberry yellow eye field beans, snap beans, scarlet runner, <b>kudzu</b> <b>vine</b> and common P.vulgaris. Halo blight is affected by environment factors and enter through plant injuries or natural openings. The development of the Halo blight is highly favored by cool temperature (such as 20-23°C), unlike other common bacterial blights. In warm temperatures (over 24 °C), the production of phaseolotoxin decreases and symptoms become less obvious. Phaseolotoxin is a toxin produced by Halo blight pathogen which causes systemic chlorosis. Halo blight causes small water-soaked spots on leaves. These spot progressively turn dark brown and are surrounded by a wide greenish yellow halo. The necrotic spots remain small unlike that of common blight. Similar to foliage symptoms, halo blights causes water-soaked spots on vegetative pods. It also causes streaks along pod sutures. If lesions becomes severe on the pods, it may penetrate the pod walls or expand into the pod sutures which causes the seed to be wrinkled and discolored (yellow patches on the seed coat). Systemic infections are not common, but occur more favorably in some dry bean varieties. If the disease develops a systemic infection, it will cause curling, yellowing and death of young leaflets.|$|E
