40|$|Continued {{sea-level rise}} and coastal {{development}} {{have led to}} considerable concerns on coastline changes along inhabited islands. Analysis of long-term coastline changes of islands is however limited due to unavailable data {{and the cost of}} field work. In this study, high-resolution images taken from 1970 – 2011 at an interval of about 10 years and topographic maps were collected to determine coastline changes and their drivers in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Results show that nearly all inhabited islands appeared to have noteworthy seaward expansion during the past four decades. Coastline change rates varied among islands, and the annual change rate of Zhoushan Island (the main island) reached 12. 83 ± 0. 17 m/year during the same period. Since 2003, the study area has been dominated by artificial coast. The proportion of harbor/port and urban/industrial coast has significantly increased, while rocky coasts and shelter-farm coasts have shrunk greatly. Preliminary analysis of drivers for these coastline changes across the Zhoushan Islands highlights the roles of human policies during different periods as well as location, which were the dominant factors controlling the great spatial and temporal complexity of coastline changes of the major islands. Sediment supply from the Yangtze River decreased after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam in 2003; however, the Zhoushan coast rapidly accreted seaward during the last decade and the artificial siltation, coastal engineering, and harbor <b>dredging</b> <b>materials</b> could be responsible for the observed coastline changes. Pressured by rapid development of the port industry, the Zhoushan coast may face unprecedented challenges in coastal use in the near future.

Dredging sometimes occur {{in areas where the}} sediments are contaminated material and is subject to consent and licensing according to the national regulations. This work shows the general pattern of distribution of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, in surface sediments of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon mouth area (Portugal). The work is based on textural, mineralogical and geochemical analysis of 137 surface sediment (first centimetre) samples. The Pollution Load Index (PLI) was used to evaluate the overall enrichment of these elements and the enrichment factor (EF) was determined to assess the degree of anthropogenic input of taking into account the characteristics of the receiving environment and its legitimate use; and one station (29) as slightly contaminated dredged material (Class 3) that may be used for embankments {{or in the case of}} soaking requires a thorough study of the place of deposition and subsequent PTEs.

The PLI index values show the highest enrichment of metals in the western side of Mira Channel entrance.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Each year nearly 30 million cubic yards of sediment are dredged from the Texas waterways and ports. A majority of the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> is disposed in confined disposal facilities, and these disposal sites are being filled. As these sites reach capacity, land must be found and purchased to build new disposal sites. Constructing new confined disposal sites is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, alternatives to confined disposal facilities are being considered. One of the proposed alternatives is to convert <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> to manufactured soil (artificial topsoil). A limited number of studies have been conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Waterways Experiment Station in conjunction with local USACE Districts to demonstrate the applicability of manufactured soil. Manufactured soil is created using <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> and recyclable organic waste materials such as bio-solids (sewage sludge), animal manure, yard waste, and bio-mass (cellulose or saw dust). Manufactured soil helps reduce and recycle wastewater sludge and provides an alternative for the long-term management of <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> disposal sites by reducing the area needed for the placement of <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> in a confined disposal facility (CDF). The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the applicability of converting <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> to topsoil as a beneficial use of <b>dredged</b> <b>material.</b> The site selection in terms of location, material, and marketing are paramount in determining the most economically feasible alternative.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{method of}} <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> {{disposal}} used by site managers on inland rivers is called mechanical redistribution. This involves initially placing the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> on the adjacent {{banks of the}} channel where the <b>material</b> is <b>dredged.</b> With the onset of high flows moving down the river, the material is then either pushed back into the stream or {{is expected to be}} eroded by the overbank flows. There is a need for a numerical predictive capability for the fate of <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> disposed in this manner. This technical note (TN) describes such a capability. BACKGROUND: Dredging and the subsequent disposal of the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> occur in most of the nation's inland waterways that are used for commercial navigation. An important aspect in determining the impact of these operations is predicting where and how the disposed material is dispersed and/or deposited after the disposal operation. The initial deposition may take place over a time frame ranging from minutes to hours. A second major consideration is the longer-term sediment movement patterns (over a time frame of perhaps days or months) in or near the disposal sites and waterways. One method of <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> disposal that is sometimes used on inland waterways involves the placement of the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> {{along the banks of the}} waterway.

Therefore, slag-mixed material made from the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> and steelmaking slag has been proposed. In this study, control of hydrogen sulfide release resulting from changing the hardness of the slag-mixed materials has been examined. Hydrogen sulfide release strongly depends on the hardness of the slag-mixed material. Microbial analysis indicated fewer living bacteria and the relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the slag-mixed material compared with the <b>dredged</b> <b>material.</b> The solidification of the <b>dredged</b> <b>material</b> using steelmaking slag decreased not only hydrogen sulfide release but also dissolved iron and manganese release.
