It was this desire that led me to travel the world - to Pakistan, Venezuela, Iraq and more - looking for stories and meeting fascinating people along the way. It was a great trip, sometimes travelling to dangerous places, which is why <b>I</b> never <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> where <b>I</b> was when travelling - check out my video, photos and blogs from the trip here, but do me a favour - Don't Tell <b>My</b> <b>Mother.</b>|$|R
60|$|That Sunday {{my mother}} {{wanted me to}} go to church very particularly. She had a double reason for that; she thought that it would {{certainly}} exercise a favorable influence upon my search for a situation throughout the next week, and in addition Mr. Gabbitas, with a certain mystery behind his glasses, had promised to see what he could do for me, and she wanted to keep him up to that promise. I half consented, and then my desire for Nettie took hold of me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> I wasn't going to church, and set off about eleven to walk the seventeen miles to Checkshill.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{one wants}} a thing {{done in a}} hurry one must see to it oneself. I found a {{military}} Johnny hanging round on a loose end at the club, and took him home to lunch once or twice. He'd {{spent most of his}} life on the Indian frontier, building roads, and relieving famines and minimizing earthquakes, and all that sort of thing that one does do on frontiers. He could talk sense to a peevish cobra in fifteen native languages, and probably knew what to do if you found a rogue elephant on your croquet-lawn; but he was shy and diffident with women. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> privately that he was an absolute woman-hater; so, of course, she laid herself out to flirt all she knew, which isn't a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, father; I {{have never}} {{so much as}} thought of that. I could not imagine that I, as a boy, could be of any great service. I thought I might, perhaps, being so young, {{be able to be}} of use in passing among the Spaniards and {{carrying}} messages where a man could not get through. I thought sometimes I might perhaps carry a warning in time to enable women to escape with their children from a town that was about to be beleaguered, and I hoped that if I did stand in the ranks to face the Spaniards I should not disgrace my nation and blood. I know, father, that it was presumptuous for me to think that I could be of any real use; and if you are against it I will, of course, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> submit myself cheerfully to your wishes." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Osborne {{was born}} in Paddington, London, as Gideon Oliver Osborne; he decided when he was 13 to be known by the {{additional}} first name of 'George'. In an interview in July 2005, he said: [...] "It was my small act of rebellion. I never liked it [...] When <b>I</b> finally <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> she said, 'Nor do I'. So I decided to be George after my grandfather, who was a war hero. Life was easier as a George; it was a straightforward name." [...] He is the eldest of four boys. His father Sir Peter Osborne co-founded the firm of fabric and wallpaper designers Osborne & Little. His mother is Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock, the daughter of Hungarian-born artist Clarisse Loxton-Peacock (née Fehér).|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Museau and I {{managed to}} be pretty good friends. If I could be exchanged, or sent home, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would pay liberally for my ransom; and I suppose this idea excited the cupidity of the commandant, for a trapper coming in the winter, whilst I still lay very ill with fever, Museau consented that I should write home to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> but that the letter should be in French, that he should see it, and that I should say I was {{in the hands of}} the Indians, and should not be ransomed under ten {{thousand}} livres.|$|R

You said you loved me, and I believed you, and the rest was a thing of course. And you meant it. You know you meant it. When you held me in your arms in the carriage you know you meant me to suppose that it would always be so. Then the fear of your sister came upon you, and of your sister's husband,--and you ran away! I wonder whether you think yourself a man!" [...] And yet {{she felt that she}} had not hit him yet. He was wretched enough; and she {{could see that he was}} wretched;--but the wretchedness would pass away as soon as she was gone. How could she stab him so that the wound would remain? With what virus could she poison her arrow, so that the agony might be prolonged? [...] "And such a coward too! I began to suspect it when you started that night from Mistletoe,--though I did not think then that you could be all mean, all cowardly. From that day to this, you have not dared to speak a word of truth. Every word has been a falsehood." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were most}} {{tremendous}} disturbances {{going on all}} the time out of door. Wonderful stories came to us of a fearful uproar in the Parliament between the Prince and the Coadjutor de Gondi, when the Duke of Rochefoucauld got the Coadjutor between two folding-doors, let down the iron bar of them on his neck, and was as nearly as possible the death of him. Then there was a plot for murdering the Prince of Conde in the streets, said to be go up by the Queen-Regent herself, after consulting one of her priests, who told her that she might regard the Prince as an enemy of the State, and that she might lawfully rid herself of him by private means when a public execution was inexpedient. A fine religion that! as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> when M. d'Aubepine came in foaming at the mouth about it; though Eustace would have persuaded me that it was not just to measure a whole Church by one priest. The Prince fortified his house, and lived like a man in a state of siege for some time, and then went off to Chantilly, take d'Aubepine with him--and every one said a new Fronde was beginning, for the Queen-Regent was furious with the Princes, and determined to have Cardinal Mazarin back, and the Prince was equally resolved to keep him out, while as to the Parliament, I had no patience with it; it went on shilly-shallying between the two, and had no substance to do anything by hang on to some selfish Court party.|$|E
6000|$|Duncan Campbell. No, {{he writes}} sometimes, but oftener he speaks with his fingers, and mighty swift; no man {{can do it}} so quick, or write half so soon; he has a little bell in his hand, like that which my mother makes me a sign to shake when she wants the servants: with that he tickles my brain strangely, and gives me an {{incredible}} delight of feeling in {{the inside of my}} head; he usually wakes me with it in the morning when he comes to make me an appointment. I fancy it is what you call hearing, which makes me mighty desirous I could hear in your way; it is sweeter to the feeling, methinks, than anything is to the taste; it is just as if my head was tickled to death, as my nurse used to tickle my sides; but it is a different feeling, for it makes things like little strings tremble in my temples and behind my ears. Now I remember, I will {{tell you what it is}} like, that makes me believe it is like your hearing, and that strange thing which you that can speak, call sound or noise: because, when I was at church with my mother, who told me the bells could be heard ringing a mile off, as I was kneeling on the bench, and leaning over the top of the pew and gnawing the board, every time the man pulled the rope, I thought all my head beat as if it would come to pieces, but yet it pleased me methought, rather than pained me, and I would be always gnawing the board when the man pulled the rope, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> the reason: the feeling of that was something like the little bell, but only that made my head throb, as if it would break, and this tickles me, and makes, as it were, little strings on the back of my ears dance and tremble like anything; is not that like your way of hearing? If it be, it is a sweet thing to hear; it is more pleasant than to see the finest colours in the world; it is something like being tickled in the nose with a feather till one sneezes, or like the feeling after one strikes the leg when it has been numb, or asleep, only with this difference, that those two ways give a pain, and the other a pleasure. I remember, too, when I had a great cold, for about two months, I had a feeling something like it, but that was blunt, dull, confused, and troublesome. Is not this like what you call hearing? ...|$|E
6000|$|Evidently, she {{saw nothing}} {{especially}} significant in my request, {{but to me}} it was a subtle stratagem. To have her take part in my bargain-hunting was almost as exciting as though we were furnishing OUR home, but I dared not assume that she was thinking along these dangerous lines. That she was genuinely interested in my household problems was evident, but I was not justified in asking anything further. She was distinctly closer to me that day, more tenderly intimate than she had ever been before, and her womanly understanding of my task--the deep sympathy she expressed when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> recent illness--all combined to give me comfort--and hope! ...|$|R

It was in the unrestrained intercourse of family conversation that I chanced to impart to my father the sentiments which my dear girl had uttered. Perhaps I spoke slightingly of your courage, which I don't doubt--by Heaven, I don't doubt: it may be, she has erred, too, regarding you. It {{may be that the}} fiend jealousy has been gnawing at my bosom, and--horrible suspicion!--that I thought my sister's lover found too much favour with her I would have all my own.

60|$|Never shall I {{forget my}} first servant. I was eight or nine, in velveteen, diamond socks (‘Cross your legs {{when they look}} at you,’ <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had said, ‘and put your thumb in your pocket and leave the top of your {{handkerchief}} showing’), and I had travelled by rail to visit a relative. He had a servant, and as I was to be his guest she must be my servant also for the time being—you may be sure I had got <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to put this plainly before me ere I set off. My relative met me at the station, but I wasted no time in hoping I found him well. I did not even cross my legs for him, so eager was I to hear whether she was still there. A sister greeted me at the door, but I chafed at having to be kissed; at once I made for the kitchen, where, I knew, they reside, and there she was, and I crossed my legs and put one thumb in my pocket, and the handkerchief was showing. Afterwards I stopped strangers on the highway with an offer to show her to them through the kitchen window, and I doubt not the first letter <b>I</b> ever wrote <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> what they are like when they are so near that you can put your fingers into them.|$|R

5000|$|Rathbun {{entered the}} food {{industry}} at age 14, washing dishes at a local Sambo's, a job {{for which he had}} lied about his age, claiming to be one year older. By the end of his first day as a dishwasher, he had asked to help the night cook, who within three weeks recommended that Rathbun be promoted to the cooking station. At age 17, he was working as an apprentice in the 5-star dining room of Kansas City's La Bonne Auberge restaurant, where his mother worked as a maitre d'. The fine dining experience changed his culinary tastes, causing him to come home determined to educate the experienced cooks in his household: [...] "When I started learning how to work with fresh vegetables and snails and foie gras, that's when my taste just exploded. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> `I can't believe it.

60|$|There {{were two}} or three persons in the world (for <b>I</b> had not <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> how <b>I</b> was {{resolved}} to cede to my brother all my life-interest in our American property) who knew that I had no mercenary motives {{in regard to the}} conduct I pursued. It was not worth while to undeceive others; what were life worth, if a man were forced to feel himself a la piste of all the calumnies uttered against him? And I do not quite know to this present day, how it happened that <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> that notorious Loyalist, was left for several years quite undisturbed in her house at Castlewood, a stray troop or company of Continentals being occasionally quartered upon her. I do not know for certain, I say, how this piece of good fortune happened, though I can give a pretty shrewd guess as to the cause of it. Madam Fanny, after a campaign before Boston, came back to Fanny's Mount, leaving her Colonel. My modest Hal, until the conclusion of the war, would accept no higher rank, believing that in command of a regiment he could be more useful than in charge of a division. Madam Fanny, I say, came back, and it was remarkable after her return how her old asperity towards <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> seemed to be removed, and what an affection she showed for her and all the property. She was great friends with the Governor and some of the most influential gentlemen of the new Assembly:--Madam Esmond was harmless, and for her son's sake, who was bravely battling for his country, her errors should be lightly visited:--I know not how it was, but for years she remained unharmed, except in respect of heavy Government requisitions, which of course she had to pay, and {{it was not until the}} redcoats appeared about our house, that much serious evil came to it.|$|R

5000|$|Oberlander {{was born}} at Muelheim-Ruhr, Germany, on June 20, 1921. In 1938, when she was 18, {{she and her sister}} and mother escaped Nazi {{persecution}} after the [...] "Kristallnacht" [...] of Broken Glass pogrom and fled to England, and then emigrated to the United States in 1939. [...] Her mother, Beate Hahn, a horticulturist who wrote gardening books for children, fostered in her a deep love and appreciation for nature from a young age. Since she had a garden bed when she was four years old and planted peas and corn, she knew the joy of growing. In an interview with Mechtild Manus, tracing the roots of Oberlander's interests in landscape architecture, Oberlander stated [...] "At the age of eleven...I studied a mural in the artist's studio showing the river Rhine and an imaginary town. When I asked the artist about the green spaces in this mural, she told me that these were parks. When I came home <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> 'I want to make parks.' From there all my education was directed towards becoming a landscape architect." [...] Her mother had a truck farm during the war, in New Hampshire, which Oberlander worked on.|$|E
