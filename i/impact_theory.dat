40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} multidisciplinary research in the debates over extraterrestrial <b>impact</b> <b>theories</b> of mass extinction throughout the 1980 s within a conceptual framework provided largely by Bruno Latour's Science in Action. To this end, {{the background of the}} debate is examined with respect to both the theoretical legacy of uniformitarianism and the failure of <b>impact</b> <b>theories</b> of mass extinction prior to the modern extinction debate. The ability of the Alvarez group to enrol support {{from a variety of sources}} is described and the repercussions of their research, including the input of astronomy and statistics in transforming the extinction debate into the study of the earth as part of a larger astronomical system. The volcanic challenge to <b>impact</b> <b>theories</b> is examined before concluding with a discussion of the importance of nuclear winter research and the role of the popular press in facilitating communication across disciplinary boundaries and generating support for theories of extraterrestrial mass extinction.

25|$|Anomalies in {{chromium}} isotopic ratios {{found within}} the K-T boundary layer strongly support the <b>impact</b> <b>theory.</b> Chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth, and therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin, which has also been proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment. Further, the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the K-T boundary {{are similar to the}} chromium isotopic ratios found in carbonaceous chondrites. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a carbonaceous asteroid, but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to carbonaceous chondrites.|$|E

2500|$|The giant impact hypothesis, {{originally}} {{proposed in}} the early 1980s, was met with skepticism due to the impact area's non-radial (elliptical) shape, where a circular pattern would be stronger support for impact by larger object(s). But a 2008 study provided additional research that supports a single giant impact. [...] Using geologic data, researchers found support for the single impact of a large object hitting Mars at approximately a 45-degree angle. Additional evidence analyzing Martian rock chemistry for post-impact upwelling of mantle material would further support the giant <b>impact</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The giant <b>impact</b> <b>theory</b> hypothesizes {{that the}} Moon {{resulted}} from {{the impact of a}} Mars-sized body, Theia, with the very young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The Rare Earth hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the orbital plane). A planet with a large tilt (inclination) will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate, unfriendly to complex life. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is [...] "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Though the {{meteorite}} <b>impact</b> <b>theory</b> of tektite {{formation is}} widely accepted, {{there has been}} considerable controversy about their origin in the past. In contrast to a terrestrial impact source for tektites, it was argued that tektites consist of material that was ejected from the Moon by major hydrogen-driven lunar volcanic eruptions and then drifted through space to later fall to Earth as tektites. The major proponents of the lunar origin of tektites include NASA scientist John A. O'Keefe, NASA aerodynamicist Dean R. Chapman, meteorite and tektite collector Darryl Futrell, and long-time tektite researcher Hal Povenmire. From the 1950s to the 1990s, O'Keefe argued for the lunar origin of tektites based upon their chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk, composition and physical properties. Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests {{to argue that the}} so-called Australasian tektites originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of the large crater Tycho on the Moon's nearside. O'Keefe, Povenmire, and Futrell claimed on the basis of behavior of glass melts that the homogenization, which is called [...] "fining", of silica melts that characterize tektites could not be explained by the terrestrial-impact theory. They also argued that the terrestrial-impact theory could not explain the vesicules and extremely low water and other volatile content of tektites. Futrell also reported the presence of microscopic internal features within tektites, which argued for a volcanic origin.|$|E

2500|$|Rare Earth's {{assertion}} that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted. Although the giant <b>impact</b> <b>theory</b> posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly [...] "stolen" [...] much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult {{in a similar manner}} to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to disparate treatment, employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified disparate impact on protected groups. In Griggs v Duke Power Co, a power {{company on the}} Dan River, North Carolina, required {{a high school diploma}} for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of racial segregation in states like North Carolina, fewer black employees than white employees had diplomas. The Court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs. Burger CJ, for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the [...] "Act proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation." [...] An employer could show that a practice with disparate impact followed [...] "business necessity" [...] that was [...] "related to job performance" [...] but otherwise such practices would be prohibited. It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, if disparate impact is shown the law requires employers [...] "to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" [...] and that any non-discriminatory [...] "alternative employment practice" [...] is not feasible. On the other hand, in Ricci v DeStefano five Supreme Court judges held the City of New Haven had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for firefighters, which it concluded could have had an unjustified disparate impact by race. In a further concurrence, Scalia J said [...] "resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day" [...] when a disparate impact might be found unconstitutional, against the equal protection clause because, in his view, the lack of a good faith defense meant employers were compelled to do [...] "racial decision making" [...] that [...] "is... discriminatory." [...] In dissent, Ginsburg J pointed out that disparate <b>impact</b> <b>theory</b> advances equality, and in no way requires behavior that is not geared to identifying people with skills necessary for jobs.|$|E

Groups that are spatially distributed and interact repeatedly organize and reorganize themselves in four basic patterns: consolidation, clustering, correlation, and continuing diversity. These patterns allow for group dynamics to operate and ideas to be diffused throughout the group.|$|E
