500|$|September 10, {{the day of}} the hurricane, is also a {{national}} holiday for British Honduras, on which many locals gather in the streets to celebrate the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798. It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be." [...] Additionally, there was also belief among residents of Belize City that the reefs would provide a barrier against large tidal waves.|$|E

Realizing Max's arrogant determination to keep the ring, she quits being his associate, and goes to Tardio to give him Max's company records.|$|R

I just wanted to put some hope out there and say that no matter <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> nobody's going to pick you up. You've got to do it yourself and there is hope and you're going to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Houghton {{was very}} much {{concerned}} over Madame's cold. He asked the same questions again and again, {{to try and make}} sure <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> But Mrs. Rollings didn't seem quite to know. James wrinkled his brow. Supposing Madame could not take her part! He was most anxious.|$|E

60|$|The prime minister, who was {{the only}} person admitted, felt it his duty at last to tell the king how much the court and all the people complained of his seclusion, and <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the nation. He urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely little island close by, whence he could easily attend public audiences, and where the charming scenery and fine air would do the invalid so much good as to enable him to bear his father's {{occasional}} absence.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{received}} [...] "average" [...] reviews {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. God Hand received almost universal praise for its combat system and {{an attempt at}} adhering to an [...] "old-school brawler" [...] formula, attributes which the same critics found to overshadow glaring flaws in its graphics, play control, level design, and camera. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opened its review by commenting, [...] "God Hand is a terrible, terrible game, yet I can't stop playing it. There's just something horrifically appealing about <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in almost every conceivable way." ...|$|R

I only wanted {{to get him out of}} my way, dear little fellow. Oh, dear, <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of me! All from being uplifted, and my head turned, as it used to be when we were happier. Oh! I wish Mr. Wilmot was not coming!" ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that the term had much {{improved}} Agatha even in appearance and manner. She held herself better, pronounced better, uttered no slangish expressions, and twice she repressed little discourtesies on the part of her sisters, and neglects such as were not the offspring of tender familiarity, but of an indifference akin to rudeness. Magdalen had endured, knowing <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for their manners, but unwilling to become more of an annoyance than could be helped. The indescribable difference in Agatha's whole manner sent Magdalen to bed happier than she had been since the arrival of her sisters, and feeling as if Agatha had come to her own side of a barrier.|$|E
60|$|Every word in {{the letter}} had been a dagger to Trevelyan, and yet he felt himself to be under an {{obligation}} {{to the man who}} had written it. No one else would or could make facts known to him. If she were innocent, let him know that she were innocent, and he would proclaim her innocence, and believe in her innocence,--and sacrifice himself to her innocence, if such sacrifice were necessary. But if she were guilty, let him also know that. He knew <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> all that bribing of postmen and maidservants, who took his money, and her money also, very likely. It was dirt, all of it. But who had put him into the dirt? His wife had, at least, deceived him,--had deceived him and disobeyed him, and it was necessary that he should know the facts. Life without a Bozzle would now have been to him a perfect blank.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} morning Deloris attends the choir practice and realizes <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Deloris offers to try teaching them, taking over from Sister Mary Lazarus, an older nun. Deloris teaches the nuns how {{to sing in}} key and on time. She also manages to break the quiet and timid Sister Mary Robert out of her shell ("Raise Your Voice"). That Sunday, the choir perform an up-tempo hymn ("Take Me to Heaven (Reprise)") which to the struggling church's surprise brings in more people and more donations. Mother Superior, however, is horrified how the simple traditional choir she knew has changed and become modern.|$|R
40|$|You {{have found}} a hot spot in a {{substation}} with your Infrared (IR) camera, {{also known as a}} thermal imager. You know <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a problem, and you must now determine just <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Does <b>it</b> need to <b>be</b> fixed immediately, or can it wait a few days, a few weeks? What other useful information could you measure while in the substation? Two very important measurements are load and wind speed. Both strongly affect the apparent severity of a problem. In a ring-bus, or parallel bus system, knowing the current in each side is crucial to making the proper call. This paper discusses making these measurements safely using inexpensive instrumentation that is currently available...|$|R

He withdrew thrice over, to give the Officers time to recover themselves; {{but it was all}} in vain. The King, contrary to wont, restrained himself amazingly, and would not show his displeasure in public.

6000|$|... "We were a week {{working up}} {{as far as}} Yarmouth Roads, {{and then we got}} into a gale--the famous October gale of twenty-two years ago. It was wind, lightning, sleet, snow, and a terrific sea. We were flying light, and you may imagine <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when I tell you we had smashed bulwarks and a flooded deck. On the second night she shifted her ballast into the lee bow, and by that time we had been blown off somewhere on the Dogger Bank. There was nothing for it but go below with shovels and try to right her, and there we were in that vast hold, gloomy like a cavern, the tallow dips stuck and {{flickering}} on the beams, the gale howling above, the ship tossing about like mad on her side; there we all were, Jermyn, the captain, everyone, hardly able to keep our feet, engaged on that gravedigger's work, and trying to toss shovelfuls of wet sand up to windward. At every tumble of the ship you could see vaguely in the dim light men falling down with a great flourish of shovels. One of the ship's boys (we had two), impressed by the weirdness of the scene, wept as if his heart would break. We could hear him blubbering somewhere in the shadows.|$|E
