At <b>demolding,</b> the cheese is salted with dry salt (not soaking in brine). Work at the dairy then completes and the cheeses are shipped to the maturing cellar. Upon arriving at the maturing cellar, the cheeses are then brushed or washed and wiped. They are then perforated: this operation promotes internal ventilation of the cheese and allows harmonious development of mold. The cheese is then stored on racks in cellars naturally temperature controlled by fleurine. Between production and refinement, preparation should take at least 70 days.

40|$|Polymer-based {{microfluidic}} "lab on a chip" technology {{promises to}} reduce cost and extend {{access to medical}} diagnostic tests that formerly required expensive and labor-intensive lab work. The predominant methods for manufacturing these devices are miniaturized molding processes including casting, injection molding, and hot embossing. These techniques have in common {{the use of a}} mold to define the shape of functional features (fluidic channels), the separation of the part from the mold as a process step (<b>demolding),</b> and the intended re-use of the mold to produce additional parts. The <b>demolding</b> step in particular poses significant challenges for mass production. <b>Demolding</b> affects several issues including production rate, part quality, and mold lifetime, and demolding-related defects are frequently observed. Despite its importance, there has been no comprehensive effort to analyze <b>demolding</b> theoretically or experimentally. This thesis aims to deepen the understanding of <b>demolding</b> of polymer microstructures in order to facilitate mass manufacturing of polymer-based devices with micro-scale functional features, such as microfluidic chips. A theory of <b>demolding</b> mechanics has been proposed that combines the effects of thermal stress, friction, and adhesion in a unified framework. A metric by which <b>demolding</b> can be characterized experimentally [...] the <b>demolding</b> work [...] has been proposed by analogy with interfacial fracture and has been related to underlying physical mechanisms. Finite element simulations based on this theory of <b>demolding</b> have been performed to investigate the effects of important parameters, including <b>demolding</b> temperature and feature geometry. A test method for characterizing <b>demolding</b> by directly measuring the <b>demolding</b> work for individual microstructures has been developed and applied to hot embossing to study the effects of process parameters such as <b>demolding</b> temperature, the effects of feature geometry and layout, and the impacts of mitigation strategies such as low-adhesion mold coatings. The results of these <b>demolding</b> experiments broadly agree with expected trends based on the theory of <b>demolding</b> mechanics proposed herein. A dimensionless parameter aggregating the effects of feature geometry and layout has been identified and related to the occurrence of demolding-related defects, the <b>demolding</b> process window, and the <b>demolding</b> temperature that minimizes the <b>demolding</b> work. These findings have been generalized to provide processing and design guidance for industrial application of polymer micro-molding. by Matthew E. Dirckx. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{quality and}} the {{integrity}} of complex 3 D micro injection molded parts can be influenced by the efficiency of the <b>demolding</b> phase. During <b>demolding,</b> the forces that take place at the component-tool interface due to adhesion and friction need to be overcome. Deep cores are a particularly critical geometry for the ejection, because of the shrinkage of the polymer onto the mold. These conditions are exacerbated in the case of multi-layer microfluidic devices, where several arrays of through holes are required and they cannot have draft angles. Decreasing the ejection forces can significantly contribute to improve ejection systems design and help guaranteeing the structural integrity of the moldings. In this work, the influence of mold micro milling strategy on the <b>demolding</b> forces was studied, using a specifically designed geometry of the cavity. The relation between mold manufacturing strategy and the <b>demolding</b> force profile was studied by varying process parameters.

The results of in-line force acquisitions indicated that the effects of the micro milling strategy on the <b>demolding</b> force is markedly higher than those of micro injection molding process variables.
