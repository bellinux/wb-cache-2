5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and <b>endrin.</b> Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide <b>endrin.</b> About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 1950s and 1960s, 40% of all U.S. {{pesticide}} exports went to Central America. Nicaragua and {{its neighbors}} widely used compounds banned in the U.S., such as DDT, <b>endrin,</b> dieldrin and lindane. In 1977 a study revealed that mothers living in León had 45 times more DDT in their breast milk than the World Health Organization safe level.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{pronounced}} decline in American white pelican {{numbers in the}} mid-20th century, attributable to the excessive spraying of DDT, <b>endrin</b> and other organochlorides in agriculture as well as widespread draining and pollution of wetlands. But populations have recovered well after stricter environmental protection laws came into effect, and are stable or slightly increasing today. By the 1980s, more than 100,000 adult American white pelicans were estimated {{to exist in the}} wild, with 33,000 nests altogether in the 50 colonies in Canada, and 18,500 nests in the 14–17 United States colonies. Shoreline erosion at breeding colonies remains a problem in some cases, as are the occasional mass poisonings when pesticides are used near breeding or wintering sites.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the body, <b>endrin</b> metabolizes into anti-12-hydroxyendrin and other metabolites, {{which can be}} expelled in the urine and feces. Both anti-12-hydroxyendrin and its metabolite, 12-ketoendrin, are likely responsible for the toxicity of <b>endrin.</b> The rapid metabolism of <b>endrin</b> into these metabolites makes detection of <b>endrin</b> itself difficult unless exposure is very high.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Endrin</b> is a {{stereoisomer}} of dieldrin with comparable properties, though <b>endrin</b> degrades {{more easily}} ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>endrin</b> {{was mainly}} {{disposed}} in land until U.S. federal regulations were applied in 1987 on land {{disposal of wastes}} containing <b>endrin.</b> Primary methods of <b>endrin</b> disappearance from soil are volatilization and photodecomposition. Under ultraviolet light, <b>endrin</b> forms δ-ketoendrin and International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) claims that in intense summer sun, about 50% of <b>endrin</b> is isomerized to δ-ketoendrin in 7 days. In anaerobic conditions microbial degradation by fungi and bacteria takes place to form the same major end product.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms of <b>endrin</b> {{poisoning}} include headache, dizziness, nervousness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, and convulsions. [...] Acute <b>endrin</b> poisoning {{in humans}} affects primarily {{the central nervous}} system. There, it {{can act as a}} neurotoxin that blocks the activity of inhibitory neurotransmitters. In cases of acute exposure, this may result in seizures, or even death. Because <b>endrin</b> can be stored in body fats, acute <b>endrin</b> poisoning can lead to recurrent seizures when stressors induce the release of <b>endrin</b> back into the body, even months after the initial exposure is terminated.|$|E
50|$|In the {{environment}} <b>endrin</b> exists as either <b>endrin</b> aldehyde or <b>endrin</b> ketone {{and can be}} found mainly in bottom sediments of bodies of water. Exposure to <b>endrin</b> can occur by inhalation, ingestion of substances containing the compound, or skin contact. Upon entering the body, it can be stored in body fats and can act as a neurotoxin on the central nervous system, which can cause convulsions, seizures, or even death.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, an {{estimated}} 2.3-4.5 million kilograms of <b>endrin</b> were sold by Shell in the USA. In 1970, Japan imported 72,000 kilograms of <b>endrin.</b> From 1963 until 1972, Bali used 171 to 10,700 kilograms of <b>endrin</b> {{annually for the}} production of rice paddies until <b>endrin</b> use was discontinued in 1972. Taiwan reported to show higher levels of organochlorine pesticides including <b>endrin</b> in soil samples of paddy fields, compared to other Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. During the 1950s-1970s over two million kilograms of organochlorine pesticides were estimated of having been be released into the environment per year. <b>Endrin</b> was banned in the United States on October 10, 1984. Taiwan banned endrin's use as a pesticide in 1971 and regulated it as a toxic chemical in 1989.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin,</b> an {{insecticide}} sprayed on {{the leaves}} of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize <b>endrin,</b> so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. <b>Endrin</b> is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, <b>endrin</b> {{has been}} {{regulated}} by the EPA. It set a freshwater acute criterion of 0.086 µg/L and a chronic criterion of 0.036 µg/L. In saltwater, the numbers are acute 0.037 and chronic 0.0023 µg/L.The human health contaminate criterion for water plus organism is 0.059 µg/L.The drinking water limit (maximum contaminant level) is set to 2 ppb.Use of <b>endrin</b> in fisheries has been advised against due to the zero tolerance of <b>endrin</b> levels in food products.For occupational exposures to <b>endrin,</b> OSHA and NIOSH have set exposure limits at 0.1 mg/m3.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} from 1981 to 1983 in the US aimed to determine endrin's effects on non-target organisms when applied as a rodenticide in orchards. Most wildlife {{in and around}} the orchard was found to have <b>endrin</b> exposure, with <b>endrin</b> toxicity accounting for more than 24% of bird deaths recorded. <b>Endrin</b> was eventually banned in the US on October 10, 1984.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>endrin</b> is not {{currently}} {{classified as a}} mutagen, nor as a human carcinogen, {{it is still a}} toxic chemical in other ways with detrimental effects. Due to these toxic effects, the manufacturers cancelled all use of <b>endrin</b> in the United States by 1991. Food import concerns have been raised because some countries may have still been using <b>endrin</b> as a pesticide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin</b> {{regularly}} {{enters the}} environment {{when applied to}} crops or when rain washes it off. It {{has been found in}} water, sediments, atmospheric air and biotic environment, even after uses have been stopped. Organochlorine pesticides strongly resist degradation, are poorly soluble in water but highly soluble in lipids, which is called lipophilic. This leads to bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms, mainly those dwelling in water. A high bioconcentration factor of 1335-10,000 has been reported in fish. <b>Endrin</b> binds very strongly to organic matter in soil and aquatic sediments due to their high adsorption coefficient, making it less likely to leach into groundwater, even though contaminated groundwater samples have been found. In 2009, EPA released data indicating that the <b>endrin</b> in soil could last up to 14 years or more. The extent of endrin's persistence depends highly on local conditions. For example, high temperature (230 °C) or intense sunlight leads to more rapid breakdown of <b>endrin</b> into <b>endrin</b> ketone and <b>endrin</b> aldehyde, however, this breakdown is less than 5%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin</b> {{has been}} used {{primarily}} as an agricultural insecticide on tobacco, apple trees, cotton, sugar cane, rice, cereal, and grains. It is effective against a variety of species, including cotton bollworms, corn borers, cut worms and grass hoppers. In addition, <b>endrin</b> has been employed as a rodenticide and avicide. In Malaysia, fish farms used a solution of <b>endrin</b> as a piscicide to rid mine pools and fish ponds of all fish prior to restocking.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>endrin</b> {{begins with the}} condensation of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with vinyl chloride. The product is then dehydrochlorinated. Following reaction with cyclopentadiene, isodrin is formed. Epoxide formation by adding either peracetic acid or perbenzoic acid to the isodrin is the final step in synthesizing <b>endrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) lists reductive {{dechlorination}} and incineration {{for field}} disposal of small quantities of <b>endrin.</b> In reductive dechlorination, endrin's chlorine atoms were completely replaced with hydrogen atoms, which is suspected {{to be more}} environmentally acceptable. Even though <b>endrin</b> binds very strongly to soil, phytoremediation has been proposed by group of Japanese scientists using crops in the Cucurbitaceae family. , exact mechanisms behind the plant uptake of <b>endrin</b> have not been understood. Research in uptake mechanisms and factors that influence the uptake is needed for practical application.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{demographics}} of the affected individuals and their area of residence, the outbreak was likely caused by <b>endrin</b> contamination of food. As members of these villages rarely had contact with one another, investigators determined that contaminated sugar shipped to the villages was the most probable cause, though no credible evidence was found to support this. Around this time, <b>endrin</b> was being used by cotton and sugar cane farmers in the Punjab region. A number of truck drivers stated that they had used the same trucks to deliver <b>endrin</b> to farmers and to pick up crops for Talagang, possibly leading to contamination.|$|E
50|$|J. Hyman & Company first {{developed}} <b>endrin</b> in 1950. Shell International was licensed in the United States {{and in the}} Netherlands to produce it. Velsicol was the other producer in the Netherlands. <b>Endrin</b> was used globally until the early 1970s. Due to its toxicity, it was banned or severely restricted in many countries. In 1982, Shell discontinued its manufacturing.|$|E

5000|$|Banning {{dangerous}} pesticides, {{the ministry}} of agriculture banned 110 pesticides in 1998, including aldrin, dieldrin, <b>endrin</b> and DDT.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin</b> is an {{organochloride}} {{with the}} chemical formula C12H8Cl6O that was first produced in 1950 by Shell and Velsicol Chemical Corporation. It was primarily {{used as an}} insecticide, {{as well as a}} rodenticide and piscicide. It is a colourless, odorless solid, although commercial samples are often off-white. <b>Endrin</b> was manufactured as an emulsifiable solution known commercially as Endrex. The compound became infamous as a persistent organic pollutant and for this reason it is banned in many countries.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>endrin</b> {{exposure}} has {{not been}} found to adversely affect fertility in mammals, an increase in fetal mortality has been observed in mice, rats, and mallard ducks. In those animals that have survived gestation, developmental abnormalities have been observed, particularly in rodents whose mothers were exposed to <b>endrin</b> early in pregnancy. In hamsters, {{the number of cases}} of fused ribs, cleft palate, open eyes, webbed feet, and meningoencephaloceles have increased. Along with open eyes and cleft palate, mice have developed with fused ribs and exencephaly. Skeletal abnormalities in rodents have also been reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin</b> is {{very toxic}} to aquatic organisms, namely fish, aquatic invertebrates, and phytoplankton. It {{was found to}} remain in the tissues of {{infected}} fish for up to one month.|$|E
50|$|Sugaon village: Janardhan Mavde {{was killed}} {{along with his}} friends. Twenty of the injured were hospitalized. The water well used by Dalits was {{poisoned}} by a hazardous pesticide, <b>Endrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Endrin</b> was {{formulated}} as emulsifiable concentrates (ECs), {{wettable powders}} (WPs), granules, field strength dusts (FSDs), and pastes. The product {{could then be}} applied by aircraft or by handheld sprayers in its various formulations.|$|E
50|$|The WHO lists <b>Endrin</b> as an {{obsolete}} pesticide in its 'Classification of Pesticides by Hazard' {{and did not}} assign any {{hazard class}} per the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} in the 1940s {{as an alternative to}} DDT, dieldrin proved to be a highly effective insecticide and was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. <b>Endrin</b> is a stereoisomer of dieldrin.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{doses of}} <b>endrin</b> {{have been found}} to cause the {{following}} in rodents: renal tubular necrosis; inflammation of the liver, fatty liver, and liver necrosis; possible kidney degradation; and a decrease in body weight and body weight gain.|$|E

50|$|Agricultural runoff, sewage, surface runoff, {{chemical}} spills, {{hazardous waste}} spills can all potentially lead to water toxicity and fish kill. Some algae species also produce toxins. In Florida, these include Aphanizomenon, Anabaena and Microcystis. Some notable fish kills in Louisiana in the 1950s {{were due to}} a specific pesticide called <b>endrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|People occupationally {{exposed to}} <b>endrin</b> may {{experience}} abnormal EEG readings {{even if they}} exhibit none of the clinical symptoms, possibly due to injury to the brain stem. These readings show bilateral synchronous theta waves with synchronous spike-and-wave complexes. EEG readings {{can take up to}} one month to return to normal.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to <b>endrin</b> {{can occur}} by inhalation, {{ingestion}} of substances containing the compound, or by skin contact. In addition to inhalation and skin contact, infants can be exposed by ingesting the breast milk of an exposed woman. In utero, fetuses are exposed {{by way of}} the placenta if the mother has been exposed.|$|E
50|$|In May 2004, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants {{came into}} effect and listed <b>endrin</b> {{as one of}} the 12 initial {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) that have been causing adverse effects on humans and the environment.
