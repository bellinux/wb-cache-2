5000|$|Many economists {{question}} {{the use of}} stated preference to determine willingness {{to pay for a}} good, preferring to rely on people's revealed preferences in binding market transactions. Early contingent valuation surveys were often open-ended questions of the form [...] "how much compensation would you demand for the destruction of X area" [...] or [...] "how much would you pay to preserve X". Such surveys potentially suffer from a number of shortcomings; strategic behaviour, protest answers, response bias and respondents ignoring income constraints. Early surveys used in <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> seemed to indicate people were expressing a general preference for environmental spending in their answers, described as the embedding effect by detractors of the method.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{environmental impact}} assessment (EIA) practices and limitations in Malaysia, and assesses the potential for integrating <b>environmental</b> monetary <b>valuation</b> to the EIA process. This thesis has four research objectives: 1) to analyse the application of EIA in Malaysia and to identify the current practices {{particularly with respect to}} valuing environmental impacts; 2) to identify appropriate <b>environmental</b> monetary <b>valuation</b> techniques {{that could be used in}} EIA; 3) to apply an appropriate <b>environmental</b> monetary <b>valuation</b> technique to Malaysian EIA through a case study; and 4) to provide an initial evaluation of the proposed technique by EIA practitioners. The content analysis of 165 EIA reports indicates a lack of <b>environmental</b> monetary <b>valuation</b> in EIA in Malaysia, and that project costs were poorly presented.   In addition, the semi-structured interviews indicate that the quality of EIA in Malaysia depends on the quality and experiences of the EIA consultants. The case study using CV MS technique in EIA indicated that CV MS is an appropriate technique in the Malaysian context.   It is concluded that the CV MS technique can facilitate wider public participation in EIA for a balanced and societal decision for economic development and environmental protection. As a result, CV MS can bring together scientific, social, and economic input within EIA reporting.   This thesis concludes with recommendation for integrating the CV MS technique to the EIA process in Malaysia, and makes suggestions regarding how the limitations of CV MS in EIA might be overcome to ensure a balance between development needs and Malaysian environmental objectives within the context of the Malaysian people.

40|$|Economic {{assessment}} of environmental values has attracted considerable attention {{in keeping with}} growing demands to take the importance of environmental amenities and resource productivity into account {{in public and private}} decisions. The call, particularly from economists, is usually for more such accountings and valuations. However, currently, as in the past, the demands for <b>environmental</b> <b>valuations</b> and our means to supply them are not in a particularly happy balance. Early on in the era of <b>environmental</b> <b>valuations</b> – in the 1960 s and extending into the next decade – there was considerable confidence in our ability to use travel-cost methods (Clawson, 1959), hedonic price models (Knetsch, 1964), and contingent valuations (Davis, 1964), to handle what were assumed to be the assessment problems of the day. These problems were largely taken to be estimating the monetary value of recreation visits to parks and water bodies, and the benefits of a limited set of similar amenity improvements. Most of us working in the area at the time thought that we had produced a good supply of methods and measures. But there was little demand for these measures. It was rare that any application of any of these newly developed methods had any influence on any real decision or policy. Few asked for results of such studies, and even fewer used them in the cases where they were available. There were, however, continuing refinements of the methods and growing stores of applications. These were housed largely in the theses and dissertations of graduate students, and the papers of academics – groups who found this a novel and interesting area of applied economics, and one where individuals could usefully differentiate their expertise.

40|$|The use of {{economic}} valuation methods to assess {{environmental impacts of}} projects and policies has grown considerably in recent years. However, <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> appears to have developed independently of regulations and practice of environmental impact assessment (EIA), despite its potential benefits to the EIA process. <b>Environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> {{may be useful in}} judging significance of impacts, determining mitigation level, comparing alternatives and generally enabling a more objective analysis of tradeoffs. In China, laws and regulations require the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> in EIA, but current practice lags far behind. This paper assesses the problems and prospects of introducing <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> into the EIA process in China. We conduct four case studies of environmental economic impact assessment (EEIA), three of which are based on environmental impact statements of construction projects (a power plant, a wastewater treatment plant and a road construction project) and one for a regional pollution problem (wastewater irrigation). The paper demonstrates the potential usefulness of <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> but also discusses several challenges to the introduction and wider use of EEIA, many of which are likely to be of relevance far beyond the Chinese context.

40|$|Appropriate valuations {{seem to be}} {{the main}} focus of Environmental education. However, in many instances, {{differences}} in <b>environmental</b> <b>valuations</b> stem from deep cultural constructs of what constitutes environment itself. Thus environmental conflicts may not be because there are irreconcilable claims or aspirations to the same perceptions of environment, but rather because there are fundamental differences in the way people perceive environments. Environmental educators must incorporate these differences in perceptions into the curriculum for effective decision-making to eventuate. This paper is concerned with one aspect of the environment, namely wildlife. In this paper, I wish to shed some light on differences in the way people perceive wildlife.

40|$|The {{periphery}} {{of economic activity}} can be characterised {{as a place of}} intermittent conflict/compromise over lands and resources, between the profit defined expansion of capital interests (in breadth and intensity) and pre-existing functions. The increasing value of ecological services, in relation to their increasing scarcity, introduces an additional dimension to contest. Economic discourse – predominantly definitions of values and allocation-provides a new terrain on which this contest unfolds. Northern Australian environments have existed at the {{periphery of}} the market economy. They have thus maintained regions of non-capitalised or under-capitalised lands and resources, accommodating (to varying degrees) the maintenance of ecological systems and of Indigenous systems. As increasing southern water scarcity and accompanying national policy increase the perceived and priced value of water, attention turns towards the “under-utilised” resources of the Australian North. In tandem, increased demand for mineral resources repositions the Northern Territory potential for commodity-based growth, and initiates a new range of water concerns. The capacity of cultural/social values and <b>environmental</b> <b>valuations</b> to stand strategically and practically with the potential tangible monetary gains of increased environmental transformation is central to questions of water management...|$|R

40|$|For economists, {{sustainability}} and <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> {{are connected}} in two ways. At the micro level, proper <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation</b> is required if projects {{are to be}} approved and rejected consistently with sustainability requirements. This is cost benefit analysis. At the macro level, many take the view that sustainability requires that national income measurement be modified so as to account for environmental damage. Such natural resource accounting is possible only if environmental damage is valued for incorporation into the economic accounts. The paper reviews the techniques that economists have developed for <b>environmental</b> <b>valuation.</b> In regard to cost benefit analysis and sustainability, {{it is noted that}} the technique on which most interest focuses, the Contingent Valuation Method, involves the extension of the domain of consumer demand analysis to include the natural environment. Contributions questioning the appropriateness of this are reviewed, and it is argued that they merit more attention from economists than they have received to date. In regard to natural resource accounting, it is argued that while there is little prospect of it achieving what its proponents claim for it, the modelling that it necessarily implies has the potential to both clarify valuation issues and {{play an important role in}} informing the policy process. sustainability, valuation, environment, contingent valuation, natural resource accounting, optimization...|$|E
