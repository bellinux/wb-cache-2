The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> economic benefit.|$|E

5|$|The Primary Chronicle {{attributed}} to Nestor the Chronicler is another sources giving {{a detailed account}} of events, its reliability being variable, depending event-by-event on the sources from which it was compiled.

5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted {{a conflict between}} the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose {{to side with the}} Jewish people. It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being a symbol of the recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} to financial success, but initial reviews were mixed, which criticized its violence, later {{contributing to the}} creation of the PG-13 rating. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. Some of the film's cast and crew, including Spielberg, retrospectively view the film <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> light, partly due to the film being the darkest and most overtly violent Indiana Jones film. The film has also been the subject of controversy due to its portrayal of India and Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E

5|$|Bajpayee's sole {{release of}} 2002 was the road thriller Road. He played the {{antagonist}} in the film, a hitchhiker who {{turns out to}} be a psychopathic killer, after taking a lift from a couple (played by Vivek Oberoi and Antara Mali). Bajpayee received another Filmfare nomination for Best Performance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Negative</b> Role, for the film. Pinjar (2003), a period drama, set during the partition of India, was Bajpayee's first release of the year. Directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, the film was based on a Punjabi novel of the same name. He received the National Film Special Jury Award for his performance in the film. He subsequently portrayed Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav in J. P. Dutta's ensemble war film LOC Kargil. It was based on the Kargil War, and Bajpayee was nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for it. Both the films were commercially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E
5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to the transcript, both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E

In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> light.

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before.

Hoffman of Jet wrote that, through her performance in the show, Mowry had demonstrated her love for acting and her capacity to portray a woman. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> review, USA Today's Robert Bianco was uncertain of Mowry's capabilities as a comedic actress, saying that she frequently relied on child acting techniques that were inappropriate for an adult character.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{are unsure}} whether either chronicler was present that evening. According to Crane, Froissart {{wrote of the}} event about five years later, and the monk about ten.

The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> manner.

5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
