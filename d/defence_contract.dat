40|$|Private Military Security Companies (PMSCs) {{have become}} an {{increasing}} presence in U. S contingency operations over the last twenty years.

It argues that public sector reforms as a constructive neoliberal state project during the Clinton and Bush administrations rolled back the state bureaucracy including the Department of Defence. The reduced federal workforce, managerial reform and de-regulation of government which took place during successive reform efforts resulted in the unintentional dependency on PMSCs for operational support in Iraq and Afghanistan...|$|R
