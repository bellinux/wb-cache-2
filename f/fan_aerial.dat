50|$|The roads {{surrounding}} {{the parking lot}} and resort have a very unusual shape, including a hairpin curve. The design resembles a race track oval, and with good reason - {{there used to be a}} race course on the grounds. From 1954 to 1967, the ski resort was home to Wilmot Hills Race Course. In the summer months the Ski Lodge served food and drinks to race <b>fans.</b> <b>Aerial</b> photos of the area clearly show the race track, although part of the course is now covered by building additions.|$|R

40|$|Bunces Key, a narrow, linear, {{barrier island}} on the west-central coast of Florida, {{was founded in}} 1961. Its growth and {{development}} since that time is well documented by aerial photography. Cores taken from the Key and surrounding areas reveal a stratigraphic succession of facies reflecting rapid vertical aggradation. Sedimentation began on a gently sloping platform through the landward migration of large scale bedforms (sand waves) during fair weather periods. Migration of these bedforms ceased when emergence and lack of continued overwash precluded further movement. Vertical accretion to supratidal levels resulted from the continued onshore transport of sediment and subsequent welding to the previously formed bars. Stratigraphically, the barrier exhibits a 2 ̆ 2 layer-cake 2 ̆ 2 type of stratigraphy, with nearshore sediments overlain by foreshore, backbeach, and dune deposits. The backbarrier generally exhibits muddy lagoon sediments intercalated with washover and channel margin sediments. Fining upward washover sequences reflect the unstable nature of the island. Low pressure systems commonly cause overtopping of the barrier, with the subsequent formation of tidal inlets and washover <b>fans.</b> <b>Aerial</b> photographs document {{the formation of an}} initial barrier that was breached twice prior to 1973. A second barrier formed in late 1973 just seaward of the initial island and subsequently grew through littoral drift to a length of 1. 8 km. A narrow inlet (30 m) formed through the northern end of the island in 1982...|$|R

Although he thrilled <b>fans</b> with his <b>aerial</b> exploits, the league's yearbook said he was a great rebounder and dunker, but noted that those skills were not needed for his position.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{parameters of}} ducted <b>fan</b> micro <b>aerial</b> vehicles (MAVs) are difficult and expensive to precisely measure and are, therefore, {{not available in}} most cases. Furthermore, the actuator dynamics with risks of potentially destabilizing the overall system are important but often neglected consideration factors in the control system design of ducted fan MAVs. This paper presents a near-hover adaptive attitude control strategy of a prototype ducted fan MAV with actuator dynamics and without any prior information about {{the behavior of the}} MAV. The proposed strategy consists of an online parameter estimation algorithm and an adaptive gain scheduling algorithm, with the former accommodating parametric uncertainties, and the latter approximately eliminating the coupling among axes and guaranteeing the control quality of the MAV. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically and experimentally...|$|R

The {{goal of this}} investigation was to study the requirements to fly a previously constructed half-scale ducted <b>fan</b> Unmanned <b>Aerial</b> Vehicle in horizontal and vertical flight as a proof of concept for a full-scale UAV of similar design. The following items were investigated: (1) methods to increase thrust from the ducted fan propulsion system; (2) the determination of the effectiveness and necessary coupling of the four control vanes in controlling the vehicle in vertical flight (pitch, roll, and yaw) and in countering the engine torque; and (3) the design, construction, and effectiveness of stator vanes. The following items were accomplished: (1) thrust was improved over the original vehicle through the design and construction of an effective bellmouth and nine-bladed fan; (2) control-vane effectiveness was determined, and stator vanes were designed and installed; (3) gyro stabilization was incorporated into the roll axis controls and the ducted fan flew in controlled tethered hover; and (4) gyroscopic cross coupling was demonstrated.

5000|$|Despite {{the obvious}} {{similarities}} to other successful films including Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka (1939), Comrade X (1940), {{as well as the}} more recent dud, The Iron Petticoat (1956), by the time Jet Pilot hit the screens, it looked dated and received universally poor reviews. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, referred to it as [...] "silly and sorry", doomed by a [...] "weak script, poor direction and indifferent performances by all" [...] and concluding, that it was far from being Hughes's next Hell's Angels. For aviation <b>fans,</b> even the <b>aerial</b> scenes were greatly reduced, as much of the principal photography had taken place early in 1950, making Jet Pilot something of a historical curiosity.|$|R
60|$|In reply, the wacht-meester {{applied the}} thumb {{of his right}} hand {{to the end of his}} nose, and the thumb of the left hand to the little finger of the right, and {{spreading}} each hand like a <b>fan,</b> made an <b>aerial</b> flourish with his fingers. Anthony Van Corlear was sorely perplexed to understand this sign, which seemed to him something mysterious and masonic. Not liking to betray his ignorance, he again read with a loud voice the missive of William the Testy, and again Nicholas Koorn applied the thumb {{of his right hand}} to the end of his nose, and the thumb of his left hand to the little finger of the right, and repeated this kind of nasal weathercock. Anthony Van Corlear now persuaded himself that this was some short-hand sign or symbol, current in diplomacy, which, though unintelligible to a new diplomat like himself, would speak volumes to the experienced intellect of William the Testy. Considering his embassy therefore at an end, he sounded his trumpet with great complacency, and set sail on his return down the river, every now and then practising this mysterious sign of the wacht-meester, to keep it accurately in mind.|$|R
40|$|Arid {{alluvial}} fan aggradation is highly episodic and fans often comprise active and inactive sectors. Hence the morphology {{and texture of}} fan surfaces are partly determined by secondary processes of weathering and erosion in addition to primary processes of aggradation. This introduces considerable uncertainty {{in the identification of}} formative processes of terrestrial and Martian <b>fans</b> from <b>aerial</b> and satellite imagery. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a model to describe the sedimentological and morphological evolution of inactive fan surfaces in arid settings, and (ii) to assess the relative importance of primary processes of aggradation and secondary processes of weathering and reworking for surface morphology and sedimentology and for the stratigraphic record. We studied an {{alluvial fan}} characterized by a recently active sector and a long-abandoned, inactive sector along the coast of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. Here, rates of primary geomorphic activity are exceptionally low because of extreme aridity, while weathering rates are relatively high because of the effects of coastal fogs. Long-term processes of fan aggradation and reworking were determined through sedimentological facies analysis of stratigraphic sections. Ground surveys for textural and morphological patterns at the fan surface were integrated with remote-sensing by an Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV). Discharges and sediment-transport capacities were calculated to estimate the efficiency of secondary runoff in reshaping the inactive fan sector. Stratigraphic sections reveal that the fan was dominantly aggraded by debris flows, whereas surface morphology is dominated by debris-flow signatures in the active sector and by weathering and runoff on the inactive sector. On the latter, rapid particle breakdown prevents the formation of a coarse desert pavement. Furthermore, relatively frequent local runoff events erode proximal debris-flow channels on the inactive sector to form local lag deposits and accumulate fine sediment in low-gradient distal channels, forming a well-developed drainage pattern that would suggest a runoff origin from aerial images. Nevertheless, reworking is very superficial and barely preserved in the stratigraphic record. This implies that fans on Earth and Mars that formed dominantly by sporadic mass flows may be masked by a surface morphology related to other processes. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
50|$|In June 2007 {{he joined}} former Football League side Boston United on trial, along with fellow former Grimsby players Jonathan Rowan, Matthew Bloomer and Adam Buckley. A month later Crane made {{the move to}} Boston a {{permanent}} one. Tony slotted in at centre back for the club, and his never say die attitude, that made him popular at Grimsby, saw him become increasingly popular with United <b>fans.</b> His <b>aerial</b> presence had seen him score several headed goals, and Boston boss Tommy Taylor was able to mould his first team defence around Crane. Despite his performances he became increasingly over weight, {{even more so than}} when the problem occurred at Grimsby, and once again he became under fire again by his own club manager. Taylor stated that Tony would find it a huge possibility to return to the professional game. but only if he was able to knuckle down and lose the required weight he had gained. Taylor, also commented that his weight was the reason that Crane received at least a yellow card in nearly every game he played in, mentioning that he was slow on challenging and his big frame would often be used against him when in a tussle with an opponent. Crane continued to play week in week out for The Pilgrims, but continued to struggle to budge any weight, and carried on to put on more bulk as the season ran along. Following the close of the 2007-2008 season, Crane and Boston parted company. He would remain without a club for the entire 2008-2009 season and had turned down an offer to join up with Ilkeston Town to concentrate on his new-found fatherhood. In December following the sacking of Tommy Taylor, Boston's new manager Steve Welsh confirmed the club would like to resign Crane, if he was in a fit enough state to play. Crane was present in the club's league game at Frickley Athletic and commented a return to United could be on the cards. However a deal was never struck and Crane would play no part in the entire season.|$|R
