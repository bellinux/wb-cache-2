25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E

Rito Asilo of the Inquirer writes that Burnley [...] "owes the {{improved}} clarity and coherence in Breaking Benjamin's music to sobriety." [...] Burnley has said that before sobriety, anything that made sense thematically was a coincidence, and that he would take shots if he were dissatisfied with a lyric. Breaking Benjamin's lyrics have been noted for their vague, angst-heavy themes, Burnley saying that [...] "I try to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> writing vague so people can draw their own conclusions." ...|$|E

[...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E

Greinke {{credited}} some of his performance to his use of [...] "modern pitching metrics" [...] — statistics on team defense and defense independent pitching statistics — to calibrate his own approach to pitching.

[...] Elsewhere Asimov went on to further explain, [...] "Campbell championed far-out ideas... He pained very {{many of the men}} he had trained (including me) in doing so, but felt it was his duty to stir up the minds of his readers and force curiosity right out to the border lines. He began a series of editorials... in which he championed a social point of view that could {{sometimes}} be described as far right (he expressed sympathy for George Wallace in the 1968 national election, for instance).

Later, while he is digging and filling trenches and confronted by the guards, an inmate performs the spiritual [...] "No Grave Gonna <b>Keep</b> <b>my</b> Body Down." [...] Toward the end of the film, Luke speaks to God, evoking the conversation between God and Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane, depicted in the Gospel of Luke. Following Luke's talk, the film depicts Dragline as a Judas, who delivers Luke to the authorities, trying to convince him to surrender. In the final scene, Dragline eulogizes Luke. He explains that despite Luke's death, his actions succeeded in defeating the system. The closing shot shows inmates working on crossroads with the repaired photo of Luke and the two women superimposed.|$|E
500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation.

The screening was also attended by Roger and Gene Corman, who were not pleased by Varno's presence. It {{was the first time}} the screenwriter had seen the completed film, which he did not enjoy, and he said of watching it: [...] "On my left side was sitting Forry Ackerman, and on my right side was sitting Jerry Bixby.
