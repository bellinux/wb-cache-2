5|$|Other {{variants}} {{include a}} levator muscle of thyroid gland, connecting the isthmus {{to the body}} of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone,</b> and the presence of the small thyroid ima artery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the species}} that have {{cartilage}} in the sublingua or lytta, that cartilage is not derived from the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> or hyoid arch (the bone and cartilage that supports the tongue). Instead, the cartilage of the sublingua is a separately developed structure specifically adapted to support the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> {{are part}} of a complex of small bones in the throat region of mammals, {{including}} hoofed mammals (artiodactyls). Many archaeological sites with faunal remains lack hyoid bones; however, <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> do occur in sites with large numbers of artiodactyl remains. <b>Hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> have been recovered with butchery marks and used as ornaments in archaeological sites across the Plains and Eastern United States. <b>Hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> are poorly known to many zooarchaeologists, and simple questions, such as how to side these bones, have not been well resolved. This project involved extracting <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> in place from multiple artiodactyls to ensure an adequate sample for determining side, as well as adding to a sample for identifying artiodactyl species. This poster will provide examples of stylohyoid bones from archaeological sites, as well as information for determining side, which is important for the interpretation of cut marks on these bones...|$|R
50|$|The maxillary {{processes}} of the palatine bones in the beaks of Eurotrochilus are widely separated, indicating the presence of rhynchokinesis, {{or the ability to}} flex the upper beak. In addition, Eurotrochilus appear to have long nasal openings and large <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones.</b> The large <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> are thought to support a long protractile tongue, which extant hummingbirds use to lap up nectar.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> {{are small}} {{bones of the}} throat found beneath the lower jaws of mammals. They are robust and distinctive, but are {{nonetheless}} uncommonly reported in archaeological sites. There is little literature available at present that can facilitate element identification as well as species differentiation of <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones.</b> To address this gap, I examined 35 <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> from eight important artiodactyl (hoofed mammal) species in the CWU Zooarchaeology collection and Burke Museum Mammalogy collection. The <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> of bison, cattle, deer, elk, pronghorn, bighorn and domestic sheep vary in length, shaft thickness, anterior and posterior morphology, and degree of shaft curvature. For example, {{compared to the other}} species, pronghorn hyoids have shafts that are thinner and less arched, as well as a much wider, anterior-curving process on the posterior end. Domesticated species seem to have thicker medial-lateral widths than their most closely related wild species. The characteristics described here are suggestive rather than deterministic, and more research as well as larger sample sizes are needed...|$|R
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

40|$|Deformity {{of lower}} jaw as a {{dislocation}} of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> between the mandibular branches {{was observed in}} the Malabar red snapper, Lutjanus argentimaculatus landed at Kasimedu Fishing Harbour, Chennai on 20 th July 2011. There was about 1. 8 t of L. argentimaculatus (in the size range 520 - 620 mm length and 4. 5 - 5. 5 kg weight) landed by mechanised trawlers. The lower jaw outgrowth size was 80 mm. A similar type of lower jaw deformity {{has been reported in}} salmon fry as a drop of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> between the mandibular branches...|$|R
50|$|By {{convergent}} evolution, pangolins, {{the giant}} anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), and the tube-lipped nectar bat {{all have a}} tongue that is detached from their <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> and extend past the pharynx deep into the thorax. This extension lies between the sternum and the trachea.|$|R

25|$|During the 1970s, it {{was widely}} {{believed}} that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities. It was claimed that they possessed a <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> so {{high up in the}} vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} longitudinal muscle {{runs along}} the upper surface of the tongue under the mucous membrane, and elevates, assists in retraction of, or deviates {{the tip of the}} tongue. It originates near the epiglottis, at the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone,</b> from the median fibrous septum.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and compares}} two <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> {{from the middle}} Pleistocene site of the Sima de los Huesos in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Spain). The Atapuerca SH hyoids are humanlike in both their morphology and dimensions, and they clearly differ from the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> of chimpanzees and Australopithecus afarensis. Their comparison with the Neandertal specimens Kebara 2 and SDR- 034 {{makes it possible to}} begin to approach the question of temporal variation and sexual dimorphism in this bone in fossil humans. The results presented here show that the degree of metric and anatomical variation in the fossil sample was similar in magnitude and kind to living humans. Modern hyoid morphology was present by at least 530 kya and appears to represent a shared derived feature of the modern human and Neandertal evolutionary lineages inherited from their last common ancestor...|$|R
5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic has {{implications}} for its reproductive behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|R
50|$|Primates also exhibit sexual {{dimorphism}} in skeletal structures. In general, skeletal dimorphism in primates {{is primarily}} {{known as a}} product of body mass dimorphism. Hence, males have proportionally larger skeletons compared to females due to their larger body masses. Larger and more robust skeletal structures in males is also attributable to better developed muscle scarring, and more intense cresting of bones compared to those of females. Male gorillas, for example, possess large sagittal and nuchal crests, which correspond to their large temporalis muscles and nuchal musculature. Also, an unusual skeletal dimorphism includes enlarged, hollow <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> found in males of gibbons and howler monkeys, which contribute to the resonation of their voices.|$|R
25|$|The two mylohyoid muscles {{arise from}} the {{mandible}} at the mylohyoid line, which extends from the mandibular symphysis in front to the last molar tooth behind. The posterior fibers pass inferomedially and insert at anterior surface of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone.</b> The medial fibres of the two mylohyoid muscles unite in a midline raphe (where the two muscles intermesh).|$|E
25|$|The {{snow leopard}} cannot roar, despite {{possessing}} partial ossification of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone.</b> This partial ossification was previously {{thought to be}} essential for allowing the big cats to roar, but new {{studies show that the}} ability to roar is due to other morphological features, especially of the larynx, which are absent in the snow leopard. Snow leopard vocalizations include hisses, chuffing, mews, growls, and wailing.|$|E
25|$|After death, {{the body}} {{typically}} shows marks of suspension: bruising and rope {{marks on the}} neck. Sphincters will relax spontaneously and urine and faeces will be evacuated. Forensic experts may often {{be able to tell}} if hanging is suicide or homicide, as each leaves a distinctive ligature mark. One of the hints they use is the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone.</b> If broken, it often means the person has been murdered by manual choking.|$|E

5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones,</b> in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|R
50|$|Ankylosaurs {{were built}} {{low to the}} ground (typically one foot off the ground surface.) They had small, {{triangular}} teeth that were loosely packed, similar to stegosaurs. The large <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> left in skeletons indicates that they had long, flexible tongues. They also had a large, side secondary palate. This means that they could breathe while chewing, unlike crocodiles. Their expanded gut region suggests the use of fermentation to digest their food, using symbiotic bacteria and gut flora. Their diet likely consisted of ferns, cycads, and angiosperms. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that ankylosaurs were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below, the height of 1 meter.|$|R
25|$|The {{epiglottis}} is a flap made of {{elastic cartilage}} {{covered with a}} mucous membrane, attached {{to the entrance of}} the larynx. It projects obliquely upwards behind the tongue and the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone,</b> pointing dorsally. It stands open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. During swallowing, it closes to prevent aspiration, forcing the swallowed liquids or food to go down the esophagus instead. It is thus the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} tongue is, at its apex (or tip), {{thin and}} narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual {{surfaces of the}} lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane. It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.|$|E
25|$|The {{epiglottis}} {{is normally}} pointed upward during breathing with its underside functioning {{as part of}} the pharynx. During swallowing, elevation of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> draws the larynx upward; as a result, the epiglottis folds down to a more horizontal position, with its superior side functioning {{as part of the}} pharynx. In this manner, the epiglottis prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is at the back. Should food or liquid enter the windpipe due to the epiglottis failing to close properly, the gag reflex is induced to protect the respiratory system.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids.

5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{states of the}} gene: +/+, +/-, and -/-. When the gene is {{expressed}} as SIM2 -/-, it is considered disrupted and many physical malformations are seen, particularly in the craniofacial area. Individuals with SIM2 -/- have either a full or partial secondary palate cleft and malformations in the tongue and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone. These malformations cause aerophagia, or the swallowing of air, and postnatal death. Severe aerophagia leads to accumulation of air in the gastrointestinal tract, causing the belly to be distended.It is thought that the over-expression of the SIM2 gene brings {{about some of the}} phenotypic deformities that are characteristic of Down syndrome. The presence of SIM2 mRNA {{in many parts of the}} brain known to show deformities in individuals with Down syndrome, as well as in the palate, oral and tongue epithelia, mandibular and <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{classic example}} is the ear {{ossicles}} of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological studies originated in {{the upper and lower}} jaws and the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. We owe this esoteric knowledge to the comparative anatomists, who, a century ago, were {{at the cutting edge of}} evolutionary studies. The word exaptation was coined to cover these shifts in function, which are surprisingly common in evolutionary history. The origin of wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation is a more recent discovery (see feathered dinosaurs).|$|E
25|$|Some early ichthyosaurs were durophagous and had flat convex teeth {{adapted for}} {{crushing}} shellfish. They thus ate benthos {{from the floor}} of more shallow seas. Other species were perhaps suction feeders, sucking animals into their mouths by quickly opening their relatively short jaws. This was first assumed for Shonisaurus, which giant by this means might have secured a constant food supply for its huge body, and in 2011 for the short-snouted Guanlingsaurus liangae. However, in 2013 a study concluded that the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> of ichthyosaurs, at the tongue base, was insufficiently ossified to support a sucking movement and suggested the alternative that such species were ram feeders, gathering food by constantly swimming forwards with a wide open mouth.|$|E
25|$|Patrice Mangin, the Swiss {{pathologist}} {{who headed}} the team that volunteered to examine Al Salami's body, {{said that it was}} routine to remove some organs before autopsy - those that decay rapidly. Some family members had expressed concerns that the bodies had been returned to them missing the brain, liver, kidney heart and other organs. But, Mangin said that the US authorities had kept the organs of Al-Salami's throat, that is, the larynx, <b>hyoid</b> <b>bone</b> and thyroid. His team could not state an opinion as to whether the man had hanged himself without reviewing these, as they may have revealed another cause of asphyxiation. Despite his repeated requests, the US government never provided these organs.|$|E
50|$|The jaw of Liaoxipterus had {{a rounded}} top filled with small, peg-like teeth. The {{shape of the}} teeth, and the anatomy of the <b>hyoid</b> (a <b>bone</b> that anchors the tongue muscles), suggest {{that it was an}} insect eater, and may even have had the {{capability}} to protrude its tongue {{in a manner similar to}} chameleons in order to catch insects.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the thoracic limbs of 24 striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, {{by means of}} X-ray techniques. The body length of the dolphins, the number of postnatal dentine growth layers in the teeth, the degree of ossification of the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones,</b> {{and development of the}} gonads (when available) were correlated with X-rays and used to estimate growth stages and skeletal maturity. Newborn animals showed advanced ossification centers in the humerus and at the proximal end of the radius and ulna. The proximal end of the humerus and the distal end of the radius and ulna ossify later, followed by closure of the epiphyseal plates at the proximal and distal ends of the metacarpal bones and phalanges. We identified physical maturity by epiphyseal fusion in the thoracic limb, and considered full maturity to have been attained with deposition of bone {{at the level of the}} epiphysis-metaphysis line. The results are discussed in relation to a possible new system of age determination in S. coeruleoalba...|$|R
50|$|Draco dussumieri or {{southern}} flying lizard, is {{a species}} of agamid lizard capable of gliding from tree to tree. It {{is found in the}} Western Ghats and hill forests of southern India. They are almost completely arboreal, found on trees in forests and adjoining palm plantations where they climb tree to forage for insects and glide to adjoining trees by expanding the patagium, loose skin {{on the sides of the}} body which are supported by elongated ribs to act as wings. The skin on the sides of the neck are also extended to the sides using the <b>hyoid</b> <b>bones</b> of the tongue to support them. During the breeding season males maintain small territories which they defend from other males while courting females. Males have a more colourful patagium than females and they prominently extend their yellow dewlaps forward in display. Although living almost their entire lives on the trees, females descend to the ground to lay eggs in soil. This is the species with the western most distribution within the genus Draco, the majority of species occurring in Southeast Asia.|$|R
