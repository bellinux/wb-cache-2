Even {{the hair of}} rabbits killed on the plantation was saved, and, when combined with a little wool and the ravelings of old black silk scraps, made a <b>gray</b> <b>yarn,</b> of which officers' gloves were knitted. All of the lead from her houses —even the lead pipes from an elaborate system of waterworks on her plantation— was sent to be melted into bullets.

He was dressed in a rusty black suit and wore <b>gray</b> <b>yarn</b> {{stockings}} and shoes with brass buckles. The other was also plainly a foreigner. He was dressed in sailor fashion, with petticoat breeches of duck, a heavy pea-jacket, and thick boots, reaching to the knees. He wore a red sash tied around his waist, and once, as he pushed back his coat, Hiram saw the glitter of a pistol butt. He was a powerful, thickset man, low-browed and bull-necked, his cheek, and chin, and throat closely covered with a stubble of blue-black beard. He wore a red kerchief tied around his head and over it a cocked hat, edged with tarnished gilt braid.|$|E

60|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{appearance}} of this remarkable inmate, the routine of life had established itself with a good deal of uniformity in the old house of our narrative. In the morning, very shortly after breakfast, it was Clifford's custom to fall asleep in his chair; nor, unless accidentally disturbed, would he emerge from a dense cloud of slumber or the thinner mists that flitted to and fro, until well towards noonday. These hours of drowsihead were the season of the old gentlewoman's attendance on her brother, while Phoebe took charge of the shop; an arrangement which the public speedily understood, and evinced their decided preference of the younger shopwoman by the multiplicity of their calls during her administration of affairs. Dinner over, Hepzibah took her knitting-work,--a long stocking of <b>gray</b> <b>yarn,</b> for her brother's winter wear,--and with a sigh, and a scowl of affectionate farewell to Clifford, and a gesture enjoining watchfulness on Phoebe, went to take her seat behind the counter. It was now the young girl's turn to be the nurse,--the guardian, the playmate,--or whatever is the fitter phrase,--of the gray-haired man.|$|E
40|$|Each sailor is {{expected}} to keep his clothing in good repair. Perhaps when he is sewing up a rent in his trousers or darning his socks he appreciates {{more than ever before}} the nimble fingers and loving heart of mother at home. It is needless to say that mother would be more than glad to be able to perform these little services for her boy at sea. Very likely she has provided him with a "comfort bag" for his use at sea. These "comfort bags" were made for our soldiers and marines {{under the supervision of the}} Red Cross Society and other organizations. The bags were made of washable material, measuring 10 to 13 inches with a draw string at the top. They contained as many as possible of the following articles : Khaki colored sewing cotton No. 30; white sewing cotton No. 30; gray darning cotton; package of needles No. 5; darning needle; needle case; buttons, black and white, medium size, in bag 3 by 5 inches; large thimble; blunt pointed scissors; soap; safety pins, medium size; common pins; small comb; tooth brush; small, round mirror; handkerchief; lead pencil; writing pad; envelopes; post cards; pocket knife; shoe laces. The Navy League supervised the making of other articles for the comfort of the sea men. These w ere sweaters, helmets, mufflers and wristlets knitted of <b>gray</b> <b>yarn.</b> Units of this league were formed all over the United States. These units gave out the knitting material to all women who would knit for the soldiers at sea. If women could not go to war, they could at least do their bit at home as long as the Navy League, Red Cross and other organizations were in need of articles which would add to the comfort of the soldiers...|$|E
