25|$|The 17th {{century was}} {{an era of}} very strict Lutheran orthodoxy. In 1608, the law of Moses was {{declared}} {{the law of the}} land, in addition to secular legislation. Every subject of the realm was required to confess the Lutheran faith and church attendance was mandatory. Ecclesiastical penalties were widely used. The rigorous requirements of orthodoxy were revealed in the dismissal of the Bishop of Turku, Johan Terserus, who wrote a catechism which was decreed heretical in 1664 by the theologians of the Academy of Åbo. On the other hand, the Lutheran requirement of the <b>individual</b> <b>study</b> of Bible prompted the first attempts at wide-scale education. The church required from each person a degree of literacy sufficient to read the basic texts of the Lutheran faith. Although the requirements could be fulfilled by learning the texts by heart, also the skill of reading became known among the population.|$|E

2500|$|The Union for Reform Judaism {{states that}} [...] "people {{considering}} conversion {{are expected to}} study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and <b>individual</b> <b>study</b> with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life." [...] Its Central Conference of American Rabbis recommends that three rabbis be present for the conversion ceremony. The Rabbinical Court of the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism requires an average of a year of study to become conversant in Jewish life and tradition. Following this, converts are required to immerse in a ritual bath, be circumcised if male, and accept the commandments before the rabbinical court.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} original {{building was}} {{designed in the}} late 1960s by William Pereira {{to sit at the}} head of a canyon. The buildings arches, in combination with the design of the individual floors, is made to look like hands holding up a stack of books. William Pereira & Associates prepared a detailed [...] in 1969. Pereira originally conceived a steel-framed building, but this was changed to reinforced concrete to save on construction and maintenance costs. This change of material presented an opportunity for a more sculptural design. It was envisioned that future additions to the original building would form terraced levels around the tower base descending into the canyon. In keeping with the original master plan, these are [...] "deliberately designed to be subordinated to the strong, geometrical form of the existing library." [...] Within its two subterranean levels are the other library sections as well as study spaces and computer labs. The tower is a prime example of brutalist architecture. It rises 8 stories to a height of 110ft (33.5m). The five upper stories of the tower house collections, <b>individual</b> <b>study</b> space, and group study rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Some medical {{students}} spend {{one or two}} additional years at medical school (lengthening a five-year course to six or seven years) studying for an intercalated degree. [...] This is an extra degree awarded {{in addition to their}} medical degrees, giving the student the opportunity to gain an extra qualification, and aids students' research and <b>individual</b> <b>study</b> skills. [...] At the end of this intercalated year or two students are awarded a degree, which is variously styled as BSc, BA, MSc, BMSc (Hons), [...] BMedSci(Hons), MA, MPH, MClinEd depending on the university, level of award, and subject studied. [...] Usually students complete an intercalated bachelor's degree the year after completing the second or third year of their medical course. [...] Master's degrees are offered at some schools for students who have completed the fourth year of their medical course. Higher research related masters and academic doctorates are typically undertaken {{at the end of the}} fifth year of the course. There is typically strong competition to secure funding from external institutions such as pharmaceutical companies, as such research related intercalated degrees may be in an area the student has little long-term interest, a frequent criticism. The major benefit of an intercalated degree is the increased chance of selection to competitive training routes such as Academic Medicine or Surgery.|$|E

6000|$|The {{devices of}} this {{character}} employed by various plants for the dispersal of seeds even in ordinary dry capsules {{are far too}} numerous for me to describe in full detail, though they form a delightful subject for <b>individual</b> <b>study</b> in any small suburban garden. I will only give one more illustrative case, just to show the sort of point an amateur should always be on the look-out for. There is an extremely common, though inconspicuous, English weed, the mouse-ear chickweed, found everywhere in flower-beds or grass-plots, however small, and noticeable for its quaint little horn-shaped capsules. These have a very odd sort of twist or cock-up in the middle, just above the part where the seeds lie; and they open at the top by ten small teeth, pointed obliquely outward for no apparent reason. Yet every point has a meaning of its own for all that. The plant is one that lies rather close upon the ground; {{and the effect of}} this twist in the capsule is that the seeds, which are relatively heavy, and well stored with nutriment, can never get out at all, unless a very strong wind is blowing, which sweeps over the herbage in long quick waves, and carries everything it shakes out for great distances before it. So much design have even the smallest weeds put into the mechanism for the dispersion of their precious seeds, the hope of their race and the earnest of their future! ...|$|E
