5|$|Many centuries later, both {{world wars}} saw {{fighting}} in the desert. In the First World War, the Ottoman Turks were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that spanned the Arabian peninsula. The Turks were defeated by the British, who had the backing of irregular Arab forces that were seeking to revolt against the Turks in the Hejaz, made famous <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> E.

5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
5|$|With its {{demand for}} hardness, clarity and {{precision}} and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> S.

The rejection of conventional verse {{forms in the}} nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style.|$|E

5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent <b>in</b> <b>T.</b> fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression <b>in</b> <b>T</b> cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine <b>in</b> <b>T</b> even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the Bacillus phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the Bacillus phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the Bacillus phage SP15.|$|E
40|$|A {{mouse model}} for Down syndrome, Ts 1 Cje, has been developed. This model has made {{possible}} {{a step in}} the genetic dissection of the learning, behavioral, and neurological abnormalities associated with segmental trisomy for the region of mouse chromosome 16 homologous with the so-called “Down syndrome region” of human chromosome segment 21 q 22. Tests of learning in the Morris water maze and assessment of spontaneous locomotor activity reveal distinct learning and behavioral abnormalities, some of which are indicative of hippocampal dysfunction. The triplicated region <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 1 Cje, from Sod 1 to Mx 1, is smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 65 Dn, another segmental trisomy 16 mouse, and the learning deficits <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 1 Cje are less severe than those <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 65 Dn. <b>In</b> addition, degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which was observed <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 65 Dn, was absent <b>in</b> <b>Ts</b> 1 Cje...|$|R

25|$|The {{first term}} is a {{constant}} contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift <b>in</b> <b>t.</b> The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of t by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted t that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift <b>in</b> <b>t</b> at any finite λ is finite, but near the transition t is very small. The fractional change <b>in</b> <b>t</b> is very large, and in units where t is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E
