500|$|Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book Grapefruit {{inspired}} Lennon {{to write}} the lyrics for [...] "Imagine"—in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled [...] "Cloud Piece", reads: [...] "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>garden</b> to put them in." [...] Lennon later said the composition [...] "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it—the lyric and the concept—came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit." [...] When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind [...] "Imagine".|$|E
