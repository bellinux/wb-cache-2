This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had made the call {{on the evening of}} the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Kanō stood 1.57 m (5feet 2inches) but weighed only 41kg (90pounds). <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> were stronger. One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger and stronger opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E

When the gong sounds ten in the morning, he walks to his school and sees the hawker crying [...] "Bangles, crystal bangles!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> could be a hawker. At four in the afternoon, while coming back from school, he sees the gardener digging the ground and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> were a gardener.

25|$|Remington's Self-Portrait on a Horse (1890) {{shows the}} artist as <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> was, not the pot-bellied Easterner {{weighing}} heavily on a horse, but a tough, lean cowboy heading for adventure with his trusty steed. It was the image his publishers worked hard to maintain as well.|$|E
25|$|After this victory, Böhme was {{transferred}} to Jasta 2 {{under the command of}} Oswald Boelcke. Boelcke was not only a well-established ace, but was pioneering the tactics and strategy of fighter aviation. He had carte blanche to recruit such pilots as <b>he</b> <b>wished.</b> <b>He</b> had asked for, among others, both Manfred von Richthofen and Böhme. Boelcke and Böhme became best friends.|$|E
25|$|He {{first thought}} of {{studying}} medicine while at The Leys School, {{a boarding school}} in Cambridge, when he fractured his clavicle and recorded in his diary that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> could treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1914 but, {{with the onset of}} World War I, his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the Royal Navy as a medical officer on the destroyer HMS Lucifer.|$|E

25|$|Contemporaries of Discovery usually {{received}} the work very positively. Louis, Prince of Prussia, expressed {{his admiration for}} {{the first volume of}} Discovery in a letter to Campe. He excuses his late reply to a previous letter by saying that he first had to reread the book several times and that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> possessed all those virtues of Columbus. An anonymous reviewer in the German Enlightenment journal Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek praises Campe’s choice of topic and its utility but wishes for a more structured approach instead of the narratives. Of the general criticism that the German new humanists and others presented against philanthropinist children’s literature, Campe was usually exempt. Towards {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, however, the dialogue form had lost its appeal and in 1890 a revised German edition was published that eliminated the dialogue and solely related the narrative.|$|E
25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, White wrote The Vivisector, {{a searing}} {{character}} portrait of an artist. Many people drew {{links to the}} Sydney painter John Passmore (1904–84) and White's friend, the painter Sidney Nolan, but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends Roy De Maistre and Francis Bacon, and later said <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had been an artist. White's elaborate, idiosyncratic prose was a writer's attempt to emulate painting. By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as James Clifford, Erica McGilchrist, and Lawrence Daws. White was later friends with Brett Whiteley, the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings. A portrait of White by Louis Kahan won the 1962 Archibald Prize.|$|E

500|$|In Saman Utami {{became one}} of the first female Indonesian authors to {{explicitly}} discuss sexuality, generally a taboo subject for women, in her work. However, when it was first released Utami faced charges that she was not the actual writer; among those suggested as the author was poet Goenawan Mohamad, known as Utami's mentor. Mohamad denied the rumours and said that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> [...] "could write the kind of prose which Ayu uses". Utami suggests that the rumours were based on a belief that only men could write good novels; the literature scene before Saman had indeed been dominated by male writers.|$|E
500|$|The BBC website {{called the}} episode [...] "One {{of the most}} memorable episodes, if not one of the greatest– the satire on youth {{counterculture}} is well handled, and Homer's flashback to his youth is fabulous."

The noise rock version of the end credits performed by Sonic Youth has been ranked among the best versions of the theme by Matt Groening and also by Chris Turner in his book Planet Simpson.

500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we look at it and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E

[...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were laugh out loud funny," [...] and noted that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> could incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E

In celebration he ran behind the net and kissed a policeman. [...] "The policeman looked so cold and fed up standing there", explained the Reading forward, publicly, [...] "that I decided to cheer him up a bit." [...] In the dressing room after the game he said, privately, that <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> hadn't done it [...] "because I hate coppers so much". Reading eventually finished the 1974–75 season in seventh place, five points behind the promoted teams. Friday was the club's top scorer for the season, with 18 league goals and 20 overall, and was voted its player of the year.|$|E
