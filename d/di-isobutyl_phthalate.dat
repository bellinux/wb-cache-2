40|$|International audienceMultiple {{chemicals}} are emitted in residential accommodation. Aggregate Daily Doses (ADD) (ng/kg-bw/d) were estimated for 32 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) of different chemical {{families that are}} frequently detected in French dwellings in both air and settled dust. Daily doses were determined using steady-state models for the population, categorized into 11 age groups covering birth to age 30. Three routes of exposure were taken into account: dust ingestion, inhalation (gaseous and particulate phases) and dermal contact with the gaseous phase of air. Contamination levels were preferentially retrieved from large, nationwide representative datasets. A two-dimensional probabilistic approach {{was used to assess}} parametric uncertainty and identify the most influential factors. For children aged 2 to 3 years, ADD estimates spanned orders of magnitude, with median values ranging from 8. 7 pg/kg-bw/d for 2, 2 ′, 3, 4, 4 ′-pentabromodiphenylether (BDE 85) to 1. 3 μg/kg-bw/d for <b>di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DiBP). Inhalation, ingestion and dermal pathway contributed at varying levels, and depending on compound, air was the dominant medium for 28 of the 32 compounds (either by inhalation or dermal contact). Indoor exposure estimate variance was mainly driven by indoor contamination variability, and secondarily by uncertainty in physical and chemical parameters.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although urinary {{concentrations}} of phthalate metabolites are frequently used as biomarkers in epidemiologic studies, variability during pregnancy {{has not been}} characterized. METHODS: We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in spot urine samples collected from 246 pregnant Dominican and African-American women. Twenty-eight women had repeat urine samples collected over a 6 -week period. We also analyzed 48 -hr personal air samples (n = 96 women) and repeated indoor air samples (n = 32 homes) for five phthalate diesters. Mixed-effects models were fit to evaluate reproducibility via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of using a single specimen versus repeat samples to classify a woman’s exposure in the low or high category. RESULTS: Phthalates were detected in 85 – 100 % of air and urine samples. ICCs for the unadjusted urinary metabolite concentrations ranged from 0. 30 for mono-ethyl phthalate to 0. 66 for monobenzyl phthalate. For indoor air, ICCs ranged from 0. 48 [di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) ] to 0. 83 [butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) ].

30|$|The {{current study}} evaluates the {{migration}} of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) and phthalates into artificial saliva from natural rubber latex (NRL) balloons available for sale in Sri Lanka. It was discovered {{that at least one}} BTEX compound migrated from almost all the brands. The migration of four phthalates; diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, <b>di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and butyl benzyl phthalate were also observed. Migratory levels of BTEX and phthalates in most of the balloon brands were above the permissible levels set by the European Union. Assessment of factors affecting the migratory levels indicated migration under active mouthing conditions and migration from the neck region of the balloons were significantly higher. The migratory levels were observed to decrease with storage time, and in certain brands the BTEX levels decreased below the permissible level. One-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences (p ≥  0.05) in migratory levels of each individual compound within the same brand for both BTEX and phthalates. When compared among different brands, BTEX levels indicated significant differences (p ≤  0.05), while phthalate levels were observed to not be significantly different (p ≥  0.05). A significant difference was also observed (p ≤  0.05) among the migratory levels of compounds under each test condition evaluated as factors affecting the migratory level. Furthermore, the solvent based colorants added to color the latex were found to be the source of BTEX and phthalates in the NRL balloons.|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{phthalates}} from {{bottled water}} by GC-MS. Phthalates are ubiquitous pollutants in the environment, {{due to their}} widespread use in the last years. These compounds are used principally as plasticizers, to impact flexibility, workability and durability to polymers {{but they can also}} be found in products such as paints, adhesives, inks and cosmetics. Phthalates are not chemically bounded to polymers; hence they are easily released and migrate into foods, beverages and drinking water from the packaging or bottling materials or manufacturing processes. This process accelerates as plastic products age and break down. With respect to their endocrine disrupting potential, phthalates such as benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-butyl phthalate (DBP) and <b>di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DIBP) have been found to elicit estrogenic responses in in vitro assays. It is possible that phthalates are a contributory factor to endocrine-mediated adverse effects observed in wildlife and humans over the past few decades.

Determination by gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry detector (GC–MS) in electronic ionization mode (EI) with selected-ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition method (GC–MS (EI–SIM)) has been carried out.

The highest median levels of phthalate metabolites were for mono-isobutyl phthalate in all participants except schoolchildren, where the highest levels were for mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP). Comparing the schoolchildren with their parents, the schoolchildren had significantly higher urinary metabolites for MEOHP, mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate, and EDEHP. Regarding daily intakes, the schoolchildren had significantly higher daily intakes of DnBP, BBzP, and EDEHP. All phthalate metabolite and sums of metabolite levels in the schoolchildren were positively correlated with their mothers' levels, except for MEHP, whereas fathers were less correlated with their children. The DEHP intake {{in this study was}} higher than that of most other studies. Moreover, 10 % of the children and 3 % of the adults exceeded the Reference Dose (RfD) value (20 mu g/kg/day) of the U. S.

Due to developmental effects, PAE infants' exposure via human milk has been subjected to a number of analytical studies. These previous studies, however, revealed that normal laboratory blank values are in the range of or even higher than human milk levels due to the presence of PAE in laboratory environments. In order to provide more reliable data on PAE exposure via human milk, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate a robust and sensitive analytical method. This should be capable of removing matrix components efficiently and guarantee limits of quantification in the low ppb range. The method development took into account liquid-liquid extraction and selective pressurised fluid extraction (sPFE) as well as chromatography-based clean-up steps. The final method consisted of a liquid–liquid extraction followed by an automated chromatographic clean-up by an sPFE device.

Spot urine samples were collected during the same 48 -hr period from the New York women (n = 25). The following four phthalates or their metabolites were measured in both personal air and urine: diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP).

40|$|AbstractThe German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) {{continuously}} collects 24 -h urine samples {{since the}} early 1980 s in Germany. In this study we analyzed 300 urine samples from the years 2007 to 2015 for 21 phthalate metabolites (representing exposure to 11 parent phthalates) and combined the data with two previous retrospective measurement campaigns (1988 to 2003 and 2002 to 2008). The combined dataset comprised 1162 24 -h urine samples spanning the years 1988 to 2015. With this detailed set of human biomonitoring data we describe {{the time course of}} phthalate exposure in Germany over a time frame of 27 years. For the metabolites of the endocrine disrupting phthalates di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) we observed a roughly ten-fold decline in median metabolite levels from their peak levels in the late 1980 s/early 1990 s compared to most recent levels from 2015. Probably, bans (first enacted in 1999) and classifications/labelings (enacted in 2001 and 2004) in the European Union lead to this drop. A decline in <b>di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DiBP) metabolite levels set in only quite recently, possibly due to its later classification as a reproductive toxicant in the EU in 2009. In a considerable number of samples collected before 2002 health based guidance values (BE, HBM I) have been exceeded for DnBP (27. 2 %) and DEHP (2. 3 %) but also in recent samples some individual exceedances can still be observed (DEHP 1. 0 %). A decrease in concentration for all low molecular weight phthalates, labelled or not, was seen in the most recent years of sampling. For the high molecular weight phthalates, DEHP seems to have been substituted in part by di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), but DiNP metabolite levels have also been declining in the last years. Probably, non-phthalate alternatives increasingly take over for the phthalates in Germany. A comparison with NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from the United States covering the years 1999 to 2012 revealed both similarities and differences in phthalate exposure between Germany and the US. Exposure to critical phthalates has decreased in both countries with metabolite levels more and more aligning with each other, but high molecular weight phthalates substituting DEHP (such as DiNP) seem to become more important in the US than in Germany...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSystemic {{absorption}} of phthalates and parabens {{has been demonstrated}} after dermal application of body lotion, and medical devices such as intravenous bags and tubing {{have been identified as}} a source of exposure to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). However, use of products during medical procedures such as aqueous gel applied during obstetrical ultrasound in pregnancy has not been investigated as a potential source of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure. Human studies have associated EDCs with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to identify sources of inadvertent exposure to EDCs especially during vulnerable developmental periods such as pregnancy. ObjectivesWe conducted a pilot study to determine whether use of gel during routine obstetrical ultrasound increased urinary concentrations of phthalate and phenol biomarkers. MethodsWe recruited 13 women from the Massachusetts General Hospital who provided spot urine samples {{at the time of their}} second trimester anatomic survey. The first sample was collected prior to the procedure (pre-exposure, time 1), and two additional samples were obtained at approximately 12 ̆ 0132 hours (time 2) and 72 ̆ 01312 hours (time 3) post-exposure following the scan. ResultsUrinary concentrations of several DEHP metabolites and metabolite of diisononyl cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH) increased across time. For example, the geometric mean concentrations of mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate increased from 3. 1 ng/ml to 7. 1 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 03) between time 1 and time 3. We also observed significant differences in concentrations of metabolites of butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and <b>di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DiBP). For example, mono-n-butyl phthalate (metabolite of DnBP) decreased from 3. 5 ng/ml to 1. 8 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 04) between time 1 and time 2, but then increased to 6. 6 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 002) at time 3. Propylparaben concentrations increased from 8. 9 ng/ml to 33. 6 ng/ml between time 1 and time 2 (p-value= 0. 005), followed by a decrease to 12. 9 ng/ml at time 3 (p-value= 0. 01). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed differences are due to other sources of exposure to these compounds. ConclusionsWhile additional research is needed, this pilot study potentially identifies a previously unknown source of phthalate and paraben exposure among pregnant women undergoing routine ultrasound examination.

40|$|Dialkyl- and monoalkyl benzyl {{phthalate}} esters, briefly phthalates, {{are widely}} used as plasticizers. In food packaging, phthalate use is mainly restricted to adhesives, coatings and printing inks. Phthalates are not covalently bound in the products {{in which they are}} incorporated and so may leach from them during manufacture, storage, use and after disposal. Due to their widespread use, some phthalates are ubiquitous in the environment. Human exposure to phthalates occurs predominantly via dietary intake. Some phthalates are thought to be toxic to reproduction. In this study, the presence and concentration of phthalates in 600 food products available on the Belgian market were determined and the various contamination pathways were explored. In aqueous beverages such as soft drinks, fruit juices and beer, phthalate levels were mostly very low (< 6 μg/l). Also in confectionery, sauces, dairy products, ready-to-eat meals and baby food the concentrations were low. The highest phthalate concentrations were measured in the categories ‘oils’, ‘fish products’ and ‘spices’. A large variability was seen within these groups. During heating (e. g. rice cooking), phthalate concentrations decrease substantially, due to hydrolysis end volatilisation. The contamination routes that were explored were migration from packaging (including coating, inks, adhesives), influence of contact materials during production, and contamination via the environment. <b>Di-isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DiBP) and din-butyl phthalate (DBP) are used in inks and coatings and migration to food seems to increase in cans and paperboard packaging. Because of its high relevance for human intake, many bread samples were analysed. Results were diverse between bakeries; the production process might be an important contamination route. Overall, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the main measured phthalate. Contamination via the environment (e. g. during growth of vegetables and pasturing of cows) seems to be the predominant route for DEHP. Measurements of migration profiles in a number of food items and concentrations in packaging materials underpin this conclusion. Environmental transfer of DEHP and DBP to food was modelled in EUSES (European System for the Evaluation of Substances). The total DEHP and DBP intake is estimated to be 2. 3 % and 0. 14 % of the tolerable daily intake (TDI), respectively. At this moment, there is no concern for intake of phthalates via food. However, taking into account that measured concentrations in bread were sometimes very high, and the higher susceptibility of children due to a lower body weight, further research is recommended to explore the contamination routes and advice policy makers...|$|E
