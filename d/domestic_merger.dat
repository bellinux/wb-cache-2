In contrast, we obtain a <b>domestic</b> <b>merger</b> outcome whenever firms are sufficiently heterogeneous (in terms of productive efficiency and product differentiation). A <b>domestic</b> <b>merger</b> unfolds a wage-unifying effect which limits the union's ability to extract rents. When asymmetries among fims vanish, then cross-border mergers are the unique equilibrium. However, they may be either between symmetric or asymmetric firms.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of {{bilateral}} tariff reductions on the profitability of cost-reducing horizontal mergers. Given Cournot competition in a two-country world, for any positive tariff below a certain threshold, marginal trade liberalization is shown to encourage only those <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers</b> with sufficiently large cost-savings and to discourage the rest. For tariffs close to, but smaller than, the prohibitive tariff, however, marginal trade liberalization necessarily encourages all <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers.</b> Moreover, we show that for a given level of cost-savings, the impact of marginal trade liberalization may not reliably predict that of nonmarginal liberalization. Although at high tariffs, <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers</b> are shown to be unambiguously more profitable than cross-border mergers, near free trade, mergers which yield the most cost-savings become the most profitable. Thus, when comparing <b>domestic</b> and cross-border <b>mergers,</b> trade liberalization encourages the type which yields the most cost-savings.

This study seeks to examine the value implications of mergers and acquisitions by studying shareholder value creation for a 60 Malaysian firms which have been {{actively involved in the}} cross-border and domestic diversifications during the period 1996 – 2004. Our focus in this study is to compare the value effects of two broad types of mergers and acquisitions, which are cross-border and <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers.</b> The study entails several statistical tests, including Levene’s, Pearson and multiple regressions, to assess the extent of value creation of cross-border and <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers.</b> We find strong evidence that firms with cross-border mergers increase shareholder value measured by ROE. This result is proved to stay in parallel with the theoretical framework that suggested in the finance literature. By contrast, we find that firms with pure <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers</b> have no positive effect on ROE but our results indicate that some productivity results are yielded which means mergers and acquisitions enable domestic firms to improve their operational efficiency, to a certain extent. Further, arguments are presented to analyse the reasons why cross-border firms are able to outperform slightly than the domestic firms on average. Consistent with the prior research and past literature, our results show generally R 2 of 50 % - 60 % are found on cross-border firms across all sets of financial and operational independent variables. Comparatively, although firms with pure <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers</b> show higher R 2 on operational variables, overall results is biased.

The influence of different provisions on this measure has been analyzed for the case of Polish <b>domestic</b> <b>mergers.</b> Moreover, statistical reasoning has been conducted for this market showing that several recent legal amendments have shortened the legal procedure involved in consolidation.

The most important finding from matched data is that the strong ability by an acquiring company to monitor the target (measured by the knowledge embodied in human capital) is able to support mergers that occur across distant locations, other things being equal.

Thus policymakers have no cause to doubt the intentions of firms seeking to merge: when it is in the firms ’ interests then it is also in the public interest. However, at least for certain parameterisations, private gains from mergers become positive at a lower level of foreign entry than do public gains. This suggests that private firms may have an incentive to overstate the degree of foreign competition they anticipate facing – for example, after liberalising foreign investment rules – to persuade policymakers that a proposed <b>domestic</b> <b>merger</b> is in the national interest...|$|E

Regressions using data on entry by individual firms reveal that one-time sunk costs are an important engine through which heterogeneous firms respond to exchange rate risk generated by interest rate volatility.
