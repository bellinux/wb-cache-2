5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.|$|E

With the help of Payne, whom she <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E

For Kill or Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used on {{previous}} works, but removed the frame from the outside edges because he felt the full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an integral part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, {{they were told that}} an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E

5|$|On 14 December 1939, Quisling met Hitler. The German leader {{promised to}} respond to any British {{invasion}} of Norway (Plan R 4), perhaps pre-emptively, with a German counter-invasion, but found Quisling's plans for both a Norwegian coup and an Anglo-German peace unduly optimistic. Nonetheless, Quisling would still receive funds to bolster Nasjonal Samling. The two men met again four days later, and afterwards Quisling wrote a memorandum that explicitly told Hitler {{that he did not}} consider himself a National Socialist. As German machinations continued, Quisling was intentionally <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b> He was also incapacitated by a severe bout of illness, probably nephritis in both kidneys, for which he refused hospitalisation. Though he returned to work on 13 March 1940, he remained ill for several weeks. In the meantime, the Altmark Incident complicated Norway's efforts to maintain its neutrality. Hitler himself remained in two minds over whether an occupation of Norway should require an invitation from the Norwegian government. Finally, Quisling received his summons on 31 March, and reluctantly travelled to Copenhagen to meet with Nazi intelligence officers who asked him for information on Norwegian defences and defence protocols. He returned to Norway on 6 April and, on 8 April, the British Operation Wilfred commenced, bringing Norway into the war. With Allied forces in Norway, Quisling expected a characteristically swift German response.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} criticised in Israel {{as a show}} trial, {{although}} strict Israeli military censorship of the press, at the time, meant that the Israeli public was <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about {{the facts of the}} case and, in fact, were led to believe that the defendants were innocent. There were allegations that evidence had been extracted by torture.|$|E
25|$|Colin was EastEnders first {{homosexual}} character. Introduced in August 1986, Colin {{was one of}} {{the more}} popular characters {{in the early years of}} the programme.

50|$|According to Weikard, the {{treatment}} recommended was:The inattentive person {{is to be}} separated from the noise or any other objects; he is to be <b>kept</b> solitary, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> when he is too active. The easily agile fibres are to be fixated by rubbing, cold baths, steel powder, cinchona, mineral waters, horseback riding, and gymnastic exercises.|$|R
25|$|Barry was {{one half}} of Walford's first {{homosexual}} couple. His boyfriend, Colin, had already been introduced to the show several months prior to Barry's arrival and he had proven to be an extremely popular addition to the cast. Both the audience and the residents of Walford had been <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> {{about the fact that}} Colin was gay. This changed upon Barry's first scene on-screen, whereby the audience learnt that he had spent the night with Colin after picking him up the night before (off-screen) at a gay club.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May 1941, the Germans invited some Finnish {{officers}} {{to discuss the}} coordination of Operation Barbarossa. The participants met on 25–28 May in Salzburg and Berlin, and continued their meeting in Helsinki from 3 to 6 June. They agreed upon the arrival of German troops, Finnish mobilization, and a general division of operations. They also agreed that the Finnish Army would start mobilization on 15 June, but the Germans did not reveal the final date for the assault. The Finnish decisions were made by {{a small group of}} political and military leaders; the rest of the government was largely <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b> The government was not informed until 9 June that the country would start mobilization of reservists due to tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Altering the backstories {{of several}} {{supporting}} characters. In the adaptation, Jefferson Cope {{was one of}} the orphans severely abused by Lady Boynton in his youth, and he decides to take his revenge by wiping out her financial empire and ensuring that she is <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark,</b> though she dies before she realises her financial ruin. Jinny (Ginevra, in the novel) is adopted like Raymond and Carol, and she also becomes the prime motivation for the murderer, whereas in the novel she was Mrs Boynton's sole biological child. Lady Westholme, a US-born Member of Parliament, becomes the unconventional British travel writer Dame Celia Westholme in the adaptation. Dr Gerard, a French psychologist in the novel, becomes a Scottish anesthesiologist, develops a witty personality and becomes an accomplice to the murderer (whereas in the novel, he is completely innocent).|$|E

25|$|Reactor R2 went {{critical}} in 1960. In 1963, FOA halted criticality experiments, and by July 1972, even theoretical research using its acquired plutonium was shut down. Earlier, {{primarily due to}} cost, Sweden opted to use U.S.-designed light water reactors using imported enriched uranium in lieu of heavy water reactors operating on indigenous uranium. Also, the Swedish supreme commander announced that the country abandoned the nuclear option in 1965. Another key event was an electrical problem at the Ågesta that jeopardized the reactor’s cooling system. Although a meltdown was averted, the Swedish government was informed. The public, however, was <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> until 1993, as the government was afraid that such a disclosure would endanger public support for nuclear energy. The year 1974 also marked the final disassembly of all plutonium facilities and a reorganization of FOA that dispersed its nuclear expertise. The Ågesta reactor was permanently shut down. Vattenfall, the contractor responsible for the Marviken reactor, became increasingly skeptical of the project’s chances for success. Two key areas were mentioned: {{the idea of using}} superheated water and the reshuffling machine. Additionally, it became apparent that the plant would not satisfy the safety standards established by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the late 1960s. By 1969, the plans to build a superheated reactor were scrapped.|$|E
500|$|Pressured {{again by}} Manningham and Douglas (it was the latter {{who took her}} confession), she made a further {{admission}} on 8December and another on 9December, before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell, charged on a statute of Edward III as a [...] "vile cheat and imposter". [...] In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair {{on a range of}} other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. [...] She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would [...] "never want as long as I liv'd". [...] The British Journal reported that on 7January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster, charged [...] "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". [...] Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. [...] Mist's Weekly Journal of 24December 1726 reported that [...] "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others." ...|$|E
500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about the Messala character's motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. You should have seen those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E

30|$|The Neuroimaging {{examination}} {{was performed}} by a team composed by a neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon, who were <b>kept</b> completely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> as to <b>the</b> objectives of the study. This team was asked to judge if the craniocaudal and lateral extent of the laminectomy was enough, whether {{there had been a}} recurrence of LSS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previously operated levels or LSS development at the higher or lower level; possible delayed iatrogenic vertebral instability was investigated as well.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} of Cyathus fruit bodies {{has been studied}} in laboratory culture; Cyathus stercoreus has been used most often for these studies due to {{the ease with which}} it may be grown experimentally. In 1958, E. Garnett first demonstrated that the development and form of the fruit bodies is at least partially dependent on the intensity of light it receives during development. For example, exposure of the heterokaryotic mycelium to light is required for fruit to occur, and furthermore, this light needs to be at a wavelength of less than 530 nm. Continuous light is not required for fruit body development; after the mycelium has reached a certain stage of maturity, only a brief exposure to light is necessary, and fruit bodies will form if even subsequently <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark.</b> Lu suggested in 1965 that certain growing conditions—such as a shortage in available nutrients—shifts the fungus' metabolism to produce a hypothetical [...] "photoreceptive precursor" [...] that enables the growth of the fruit bodies to be stimulated and affected by light. The fungi is also positively phototrophic, that is, it will orient its fruit bodies {{in the direction of the}} light source. The time required to develop fruit bodies depends on a number of factors, such as the temperature, or the availability and type of nutrients, but in general [...] "most species that do fruit in laboratory culture do so best at about 25 °C, in from 18 to 40 days." ...|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
2500|$|In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Poirot {{operates}} as a fairly conventional, clue-based and logical detective; reflected in his vocabulary by two common phrases: his use of [...] "the little grey cells" [...] and [...] "order and method". Hastings is irritated {{by the fact that}} Poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans, as in The Big Four. In this novel, Hastings is <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> throughout the climax. This aspect of Poirot is less evident in the later novels, partly because there is rarely a narrator to mislead.|$|E
