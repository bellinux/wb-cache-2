Egypt has its pyramids; Zimbabwe and Zambia share the Victoria Falls and Malawi has its great lake. But according to Dr Jackie Hughes, who is Deputy Director-General for Research at the World Vegetable Centre, {{every country in}} the world has national treasures which are both nutritional and known for helping fight off disease. They are the plants that were once an important part of our diets but have fallen out of favour as other crops have taken over. Talking with Lazarus Laiser, it is clear how much Dr Hughes wants us all to realise what we could lose if we don?t take a fresh a look at what we have. Lazarus Laiser began by asking whether the world is neglecting many useful crops. Track 1 In	?Has the world neglected? Out	?your indigenous vegetables. ? Duration	 2 ? 54 ? Suggested closing announcement: That was Lazarus Laiser talking to Dr Jackie Hughes, Deputy Director-General for Research at the World Vegetable Centre. What can you do to bring our traditional cereals and grains back on to the kitchen table? Contact details: Dr Jackie Hughes AVRDC, The World Vegetable Center, P. O. Box 42, Shanhua, Tainan 74199 Taiwan Email: kiluther@netra. avrdc. org. tw; jhughes@netra. avrdc. org. tw Transcript Laiser	Has the world neglected a lot of crops? Hughes	Yes, the world has neglected many crops. They are the underutilised crops of the world and for vegetables, there are many thousands of underutilised vegetables around the world, particularly in Africa, which are with local people in poor areas. Laiser	Is that <b>a</b> problem? Hughes	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it?s</b> <b>an</b> opportunity. Because poor people do have access to the foods, but in the urban and peri-urban areas those neglected vegetables are not found because people want tomatoes and cabbage and carrots, not the leafy greens and African eggplants which are a part of traditional diets. Laiser	Now there is a movement to bring back into fashion those neglected crops. Why is that? Hughes	In particular because they are very good for nutrition, they have a lot of nutritional benefits plus they grow in marginal areas. So if the policy makers are considering climate change and an expansion of droughts or severe weather effects, those indigenous vegetables are much more resilient. Laiser	How is that done? Hughes	In environments such as this symposium, we try and sensitise policy makers and the scientists to work on particular indigenous crops which are of benefit to people, not just of scientific interest. Many of them have very interesting characteristics, but most of them are good for certain uses and we need to sensitise not only scientists but governments and other institutions on that. Laiser	What could be the benefits for that? Hughes	The benefits of indigenous vegetables are one, nutrition, and you get the micro-nutrients from those vegetables which are good for all of us so fewer people will die of iron deficiency, vitamin A and iodine deficiency. But in addition to that, markets - opportunities for alleviating poverty. If you can grow indigenous vegetables you eat it yourself, you can also sell it. And then there is the processing before you sell, post-harvest processing. So you add value, and that added value comes back to those poor people who are putting their time and energy into that. Laiser	Can you give some examples of that? Hughes	Well if you look at something like the nightshade in Tanzania, that is something which had gone off the tables, out of the meals in the urban areas, but in the villages people still ate it. So now, you can actually go and buy nightshade in Arusha and Dar es Salaam, so everybody can eat it, they get their minerals. But to do that you also need to increase the seed sector. That has to be stronger because without seeds you can?t plant it, grow it and sell it. So it is a way of increasing the whole economy through your national treasures, your indigenous vegetables. End of trackEvery country has its national treasures. In this interview, Jackie Hughes of the World Vegetable Centre highlights the value of some food plant species, which she believes are treasures, but which have been neglected. These include plants such as amaranth, which can grow in marginal areas but which is also very nutritious. If more widely grown, these neglected crops could play a role in improving diets among the resource poor, and raising their income. They could also help to maintain farm production in the face of climate change...|$|R

For instance, Maria Rosa, Berardos mother, says Berardos {{not a bad}} man, but he was born under an unlucky star, poor fellow. What a hard destiny is his. Religious references are used to foreshadow what will come, for example Donna Clorinda prays to Saint Antonio and believes her prayers are answered when she sees Baldissera in Sulmona. Nazzarena, Elviras mother, had a dream when Elvira was born that the Virgin Mary said to her I give you the most beautiful of my doves but {{you and your husband}} will pay for it with great suffering. Nazzarena herself dies and her husband is very ill. Elvira goes on a pilgrimage to the Madonna to take her life and to help Berardo in return and her prayers are granted and she dies in bed from a high fever.There are also signs of the cross in the book, for example an insect appears when Cav. Pelino is persuading them to sign the petition. Marietta claims <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> new kind. Darker, longer and with a cross on its back. Zompa explains that God decided that a new kind of louse should appear after every big revolution and then goes on to explain a dream he had. Priest don Abbachio had forbidden him to tell anyone. In the dream Jesus is talking to the Pope and requesting the Fucino be given to the cafoni,that the cafoni be exempt from taxes and that they enjoy an abundant harvest whilst the Pope takes the view of the authorities that Prince Torlonia, nor the government would agree and that an abundant harvest would cause food prices to fall. The Pope releases a cloud of lice on the houses of the poor so that in moments of idleness you have something to distract your thoughts from sin Moreover, when Berardo is being tortured, and fighting back they dragged him back to the cell by his legs and shoulders like Christ when He was taken down from the cross. Berardo, in sacrificing himself for others, could be interpreted as a Christ-like figure.It is interesting that the story of San Giuseppe da Copertino, told by don Abbachio, a story they had heard many times before, shows they think Jesus has a different attitude to rich and poor. In the church there is a picture of the Eucharist with Jesus holding a piece of white bread.Jesus was not talking of the dark bread that the cafoni eat, or the tasteless substitute for bread that is the consecrated wafer of the priests. Jesus had in His hand a piece of real white bread and was saying [...] "This (white) bread is My body" ...|$|E
40|$|Domesticating {{wild fruit}} trees Cue: In Cameroon, {{as in other}} parts of Africa, people derive many {{benefits}} from wild, or indigenous, tree species. They are an important source of food and medicines for farming families, and can also be a source of income. However many forest fruit trees are being lost through deforestation and farmers are having to walk farther and farther from their homes to harvest them. One solution to this problem is for farmers to plant wild fruit species near their homes, a process called domestication. Ann Degrande, who works for ICRAF, the World Agroforestry Centre, in Cameroon, has been part of a programme to support fruit tree domestication. She spoke to Martha Chindong about the benefits indigenous fruit trees can offer, both to farmers and to the environment, and about the challenges facing farmers who want to earn income from their fruit. Martha began by asking whether the programme itself was supplying farmers with tree seedlings to plant. IN:		?The technology we are developing now is tree domestication. ? OUT:		?. will get him a more diverse package of income. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ann Degrande of the World Agroforestry Centre on how planting indigenous fruit trees benefits both farmers and the environment. Transcript Degrande	The technology we are developing now is tree domestication and we want people to select their own trees. So the best trees they can find in their environment. We teach them how to multiply, how to propagate those best trees that they can find in their environment. However, sometimes farmers in a particular village are asking for new species, for new trees that they can?t find in their environment. And then we try to link them up with other communities, with other farmers in other areas that have those trees on their farms. And we try to develop a kind of exchange of seeds or vegetative material. Chindong	What are the environmental aspects of it, are they really achieving anything? Degrande	That is a very interesting question, and the great advantage of agroforestry is that it can combine poverty alleviation and environmental protection. Because we are talking here of planting more trees to help farmers to get more income but by planting those trees we are also protecting the environment. Chindong	You talked of fruit trees or domestication. I wanted to find out whether these trees they plant only help for environmental protection or they have other benefits from the trees? Degrande	Trees usually have a lot of benefits. Trees can give fruits that can be sold on the market that can give income. The same fruits can also be eaten, consumed by the household and that has advantages for everybody in the household to have a more balanced diet, to have more vitamins, to have more minerals in their diet. The other benefit that trees have is that they can provide firewood, they can give shade, they can also protect against wind. Trees have many benefits and that?s the good thing about trees. Chindong	Ann, if I can get you well, it means that as of now you don?t have any problem with farmers accepting the new techniques of agroforestry, your problem is only to extend the technique? Degrande	No, that would be too much said. There are always problems when you introduce a new technology. First of all there is the problem of sensitising people. People need to be sensitised and informed about the new technique and the benefits of trees and the benefits of tree domestication. That is the first thing. The second thing is adopting new techniques and especially vegetative propagation needs some initial investment. You need for instance to set up a nursery, that requires some financial means, that sometimes individual farmers cannot have. Sometimes farmers group themselves and try to generate the necessary means to set up a nursery. But sometimes they need some help, they need financial support, maybe in the form of credit from NGO?s or the government. And then another thing is about the marketing, the commercialisation of the tree products. In Cameroon a lot of tree products are consumed widely, they are in the markets. But {{there are a lot of}} problems for farmers to get to those markets. There is for instance bad infrastructure, the roads are not good and that means that a lot of this fruit especially the perishable fruit remain in the village and cannot generate income for farmers although they are demanded in the market. So there is a whole issue of infrastructure and even support to farmer groups to commercialise their tree products. And that needs some attention I think from support organisations and even from government. Chindong	Considering the villages that you work with can you picture your farmers with hectares of agroforestry gardens? Degrande	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it?s</b> <b>a</b> progressive thing. What we first try to promote is that at least every farmer has some fruit trees or some beneficial trees on his farm or her farm. So we don?t exclude that some of the more enterprising farmers, they can go for hectares and hectares of fruit trees. There will be some farmers who will do that but the majority of farmers they will integrate trees in their cocoa farms, they will plant more trees on the boundaries of their farm, they will plant better trees in their home garden and that?s how they will get more out of these trees. Another thing is that we are also developing approaches to help to assist farmer groups to market their products as a group so that they get more bargaining power. So those are the kind of things we are looking at and we want to make small changes but that will mean something to the farmer that will get him a more diverse package of income.
