40|$|This article proposes an {{attribute}} chart for variables (AFV chart) that employs {{an attribute}} <b>inspection</b> (<b>checking</b> whether a unit is conforming or nonconforming) to monitor {{not only the}} mean but also the variance of a variable x. The salient feature of the AFV chart {{is its ability to}} determine the process status (i. e. in control or out of control) by applying the very simple attribute inspection to a single unit. By selecting its inspection limits appropriately, the AFV chart usually outperforms the joint & R and & S charts from an overall viewpoint under different circumstances. The AFV chart has the advantage of being extremely simple in design and implementation, and having a very low cost for operation. In particular, the AFV chart uses a single-attribute inspection for each sample, works as a leading indicator of trouble and allows operators to take the proper corrective action before any defective is actually produced. Since the AFV chart is simpler, more effective and less costly than the & R and & S charts, it may be highly preferred for many statistical process control applications, in which both the mean and variance of a variable need to be monitored.

5000|$|Inspection is a {{verification}} method {{that is used}} to compare how true the conceptual model matches the executable model. Teams of experts, developers, and testers will thoroughly scan the content (algorithms, programming code, documents, equations) in the original conceptual model, and compare with the appropriate counterpart to verify how closely the executable model matches. [...] One of the main purposes of this method of verification is to see what original goals have been overlooked. By doing an <b>inspection</b> <b>check</b> on the model, the team can not only see what issues might have been overlooked, but also catch any potential flaws that can become an issue later in the project.|$|R

Furthermore, the buyer also should check the mortgages records and the maritime lien records to prevent any damages or loss subject to the legal issue of the ship which occurred before the delivery of the ship.

An example is given to show how this mechanism can be used to achieve confidentiality goals in situations where a single system call serves callers of differing confidentiality levels and dynamic access control prevents release of high information to low callers. A novel static analysis is given which applies to such examples. The analysis is shown to ensure a noninterference property formalizing confidentiality. 1...|$|R
