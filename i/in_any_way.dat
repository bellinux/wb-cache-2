5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{the understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way).</b> This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.|$|E

5|$|Wright rarely played {{live outside}} of Pink Floyd {{compared}} to the other members.

He guested at a concert by Sutherland Brothers & Quiver in 1974 at Newcastle Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. Though it was a low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E

5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> he could.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way,</b> but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: as expected, the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in their assigned military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> caused difficulties for both the government and the COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E
5|$|For Constantine's {{last years}} as king {{there is only}} the meagre record of the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of Dubacan, mormaer of Angus or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this {{occasion}} the title mormaer {{is attached to a}} geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.|$|E

5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> that would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
