5|$|Onions have {{particularly}} large {{cells that}} are readily observed under low magnification. Forming a single layer of cells, the bulb epidermis <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> separate for educational, experimental, and breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} anhydrous form, and if water has been absorbed it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and his fastball <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
50|$|With the Cartesian {{equation}} it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> check {{whether a}} point {{lies on the}} circle or not. With the parametric version it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain points on a plot.|$|R
5|$|Another {{advantage}} of digital systems over analog {{is that their}} output <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> store than a continuous range of states.|$|R
30|$|Findings from Table  7 {{suggest that}} {{students}} {{agreed that they}} enjoyed using the haptics device for learning and the technology <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> interact with. On average, the students agreed that they enjoyed learning physics with haptic devices, haptic devices <b>were</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and the force feedback <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interpreted. Also, they unanimously disagreed that interacting with haptic devices or interpreting force feedback required a lot of mental effort.|$|R
5|$|This {{interpretation}} <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> visualize, {{with little}} danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics; for the rigorous definition it inspires, see Natural numbers below. However, {{it is not}} obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.|$|E
5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications leading from v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5000|$|It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> change {{behavior}} by practicing {{it rather than}} knowing about it. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> act your way into {{a new way of}} thinking than think your way into a new way of acting".|$|R
50|$|It's a small {{library with}} lots of functionality, {{accurately}} documented and thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed {{on the principle that}} common operations should always <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write and code should always <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> read.|$|R
50|$|Some {{argue that}} the {{explicit}} if/then statement <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> read and that it may compile to more efficient code than the ternary operator, while others argue that concise expressions <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> read than statements spread over several lines.|$|R
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
2500|$|As well, rental {{systems for}} non-professionals need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> use and set up, {{and they must}} <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> repair and {{maintain}} for the renting company. From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made. [...] Some rental companies often rent powered amplifier-mixers, mixers with onboard effects, and powered subwoofers for use by non-professionals, which <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> set up and use.|$|R
40|$|This {{pilot study}} aims to {{investigate}} the degrees of Pidgin comprehension by Japanese learners of English, and find out whether Pidgin <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> listen to and understand than Standard English. Also, it intends to examine {{the validity of the}} testing materials. Four Japanese learners of English were recruited, and they were asked to do a cloze-dictation test and a comprehension test about the listening materials. The test score analysis showed that Standard English <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> listen to and to seek the word-sound correspondence, while Hawaiian Pidgin English <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> listen to and identify the content. Further discussion of results and issues in testing materials will follow...|$|R

5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and {{planted in the}} fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grow {{both from}} seeds and from cuttings, {{although}} named cultivars only grow true from cuttings. Plants benefit from pruning of old growth in winter {{to allow for}} new growth in spring. Dead-heading, or pruning off old flower heads, promotes the production of more flowers. Fresh seeds germinate in 3 to 20days and require no special treatment. Plants grow best in acid, well-aerated soils of pH5.5 to 6.3, {{with low levels of}} phosphorus. They are sensitive to iron deficiency, which presents as yellowing (chlorosis) of the youngest leaves while the leaf veins remain green.|$|E
5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E

We also clarified why transitions <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> obtain for hysteresis-loop bursters than for slow-wave ones.|$|R
50|$|The lateral {{tensioner}} has {{the advantage}} that the clutch cover <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> mount but the disadvantage {{that it is more}} difficult to reach nearby the bar. Tensioners through the clutch cover <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> operate, but the clutch cover is more difficult to attach.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
