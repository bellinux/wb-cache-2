Cardozo, {{who was born in}} 1870 in New York City, and was renowned for his integrity, social consciousness, and {{important}} opinions. Cardozo studied law at Columbia Law School from 1889–91 and subsequently rose to prominence during 23 years of private practice, becoming known as a lawyer’s lawyer before appointment to the New York State Court of Appeals in 1914. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. He became the nation’s best-known and most admired state court judge. He added to his reputation through highly acclaimed off-the-bench writings, of which the most important is The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). Shortly thereafter, Cardozo {{became a member of the}} group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. By asking, and answering, the monumentally simple question, [...] "What is it that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decide a case?", he helped many see the judicial role with greater clarity. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. on the Supreme Court. In his six years as an Associate Justice, he handed down opinions that stressed the necessity for the law to adapt to the realities and needs of modern life. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that [...] "seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended." [...] Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is curious, for <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{was half}} asleep fancy that I heard {{something}} of the sort. I waited quite a time, {{but there was no}} more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can get them. There's {{not many}} newsboys crying the evening {{paper in the}} trenches.

6000|$|... "Thanks!" [...] said Austin. [...] "I suppose in {{one respect}} that's a compliment. Still, I almost think, or, at least, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first went down there, that if I'd known what {{was in front of}} me I'd have stayed in Grand Canary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Crosbie," [...] he said, as {{he entered}} the room cheerily, [...] "I congratulate you with all my heart. <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> indeed.

This is a second room of mine. There were three together, you see, and as my rank is that of a colonel, I was able to get them, and it is handy, if a friend comes to see me, to have a room for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have to be}} born to love horses, maybe," [...] she answered. [...] "Maybe it's because I {{always think}} of my father on his roan war-horse that makes me love horses. But, anyway, <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{was a little girl}} I was drawing horses all the time. My mother always {{encouraged}} me. I've a scrapbook mostly filled with horses I drew when I was little. Do you know, Billy, sometimes I dream I actually own a horse, all my own. And lots of times I dream I'm on a horse's back, or driving him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Why,’ urged Mr. Parsons, {{pursuing}} his objections, ‘what {{on earth}} {{is the use of}} giving a man coals who has nothing to cook, or giving him blankets when he hasn’t a bed, or giving him soup when he requires substantial food?—“like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt.” Why not give ’em a trifle of money, as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think they deserve it, and let them purchase what they think best? Why?—because your subscribers wouldn’t see their names flourishing in print on the church-door—that’s the reason.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That has {{certainly}} done me {{a world of}} good," [...] the farmer said when he had dressed himself. [...] "I don't say the stiffness has all gone, but I certainly don't feel any worse than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to your camp. I should never have thought of it myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not in the least,' said he.

6000|$|... "You'll {{find our}} host {{a much more}} simple kind of fellow in his own house. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> visited him <b>when</b> {{he lived in the}} cabin at Yarmouth, and again in the loft at the city warehouse. He's really a very good fellow. But his {{greatest}} virtue remains what I said originally." ...|$|R
