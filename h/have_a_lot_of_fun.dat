So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places – seeing how it works." [...] Kanno is considering bringing the title to newer consoles, but would want to be able to include multiplayer features and having a time cycle within the game that would affect passengers' attitudes and the environment of the game.|$|E
500|$|For {{the lead}} single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, Polydor {{presented}} the band four singles choices, including [...] "The Show", [...] "Wake Me Up", [...] "Graffiti My Soul", and [...] "Androgynous Girls". Although [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] was the preferred choice, and also Sarah Harding's favorite from the album, it was deemed as sounding too harsh {{and the record}} company didn't {{want to take the}} risk. They also added [...] "Androgynous Girls" [...] as a b-side to the album's second single three months later. [...] "The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense.

[...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, {{and in the middle of}} the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|However, {{despite an}} [...] "embarrassing" [...] {{meeting between the}} label and the girls, [...] "Love Machine" [...] was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, being {{released}} on 13 September 2004. [...] "The pressure {{to come up with}} singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio," [...] Higgins said.

The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of [...] "The Show". For the sleeve of the second CD, Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines, one for each member, and used [...] "Love Machine" [...] lyrics as the headlines. The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b-side entitled [...] "Androgynous Girls", which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album. The Gravitas Disco Mix of [...] "Love Machine" [...] was also included. The maxi-CD also included a task-based game, created by design agency Holler.

500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players {{who do not want}} to use the pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able to}} appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E
500|$|On 24 August 1992, Mexican {{newspaper}} El Siglo de Torreón {{reported that}} Miguel had begun collaborating with David Foster and Juan Carlos Calderón on some compositions, along with English-speaking composers, and selecting cover versions for the album. He also received assistance from Cuban composer Rudy Pérez and Dominican singer-songwriter Juan Luis Guerra with the songwriting. Recording began on 4 July 1992. Miguel had difficulty finding a suitable producer for the record; he initially worked with American audio engineer Bruce Swedien, {{but decided to}} re-record the whole album after disagreements with Swedien's direction. Unable to find a producer, he decided to co-produce the album with his long-time associate Kiko Cibrian. Recording the album took almost a year and was affected by several complications, including its high budget of over US$1.5 million, his father's death, and an appendectomy. Miguel announced that {{the name of the}} album would be Aries during a presentation at the 1993 Festival Acapulco. About the naming of the album he said, [...] "This album expresses my personal self. I had a lot to do.

500|$|Following a brief hiatus, Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania {{to produce}} Girls Aloud's second album in its entirety, {{following}} {{the success of}} their debut album. Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group's contract unless he produced songs for the album. He continued, saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs, however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted. [...] The album was recorded from April to September 2004.

2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I can’t see an Academy Award in either diva’s future — but it’s {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. There’s a lot of big hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it".

2500|$|Bogart met Lauren Bacall while filming To Have and Have Not (1944), a loose {{adaptation}} of the Ernest Hemingway novel. The movie has many similarities with Casablanca—the same enemies, {{the same kind of}} hero, even a piano player sidekick (played by Hoagy Carmichael). When they met, Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44. He nicknamed her [...] "Baby." [...] She had been a model since 16 and had acted in two failed plays. Bogart was drawn to Bacall's high cheekbones, green eyes, tawny blond hair, and lean body, as well as her maturity, poise and earthy, outspoken honesty. [...] Reportedly he said, [...] "I just saw your test. We'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> together". Their physical and emotional rapport was very strong from the start, their age difference and disparity in acting experience allowing the dynamic of a mentor-student relationship to emerge. Quite contrary to Hollywood norm, their affair was Bogart's first with a leading lady. He was still married and his early meetings with Bacall were discreet and brief, their separations bridged by ardent love letters. [...] The relationship made it much easier for the newcomer to make her first film, and Bogart did his best to put her at ease with jokes and quiet coaching. He let her steal scenes and even encouraged it. Howard Hawks, for his part, also did his best to boost her performance and highlight her role, and found Bogart easy to direct.|$|E
2500|$|In another storyline Nancy became romantically {{involved}} with both Kris Fisher and Ravi Roy, who also begin a relationship unbeknownst to Nancy. Fox {{said that when}} series producer Bryan Kirkwood told her of the storyline she was initially pleased as she had always felt that Kris and Nancy [...] "would go well together" [...] but when he revealed the full details, that Nancy would also be {{involved with}} Ravi {{at the same time}} she was [...] "quite shocked". She expanded on this, saying: [...] "Nancy's never cheated on anyone in her life because that's not who she is. But Bryan said to me 'we're going to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> with this and I want it to be like a Carry on with loads of door-shutting and times when you don't know who's going to get caught'. So that's what we went for in the end". Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would [...] "be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts". She added that Nancy is [...] "speechless" [...] which is different for her as [...] "she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything". Fox said that Nancy has [...] "no right" [...] to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: [...] "No words could describe how I felt when I read it for the first time!" [...] The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with [...] "someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long".|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
