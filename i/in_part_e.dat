40|$|One {{consistent}} {{finding in}} senile dementia of the Alzheimer’s type {{is that the}} brain has reduced ability to synthesize acetyl-choline. This has been related, in part, to memory dysfunctions. Although a cholinergic deficit is not singularly responsible for symptoms of dementia, treatment strategies have been de-signed to facilitate cholinergic activity by inhibiting acetylcho-linesterase (AChE). To minimize toxicity, however, a cholinest-erase inhibitor selective for only AChE would be an ideal treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the selectivity of physostigmine, metrifonate, methanesulfonyl flu-oride and tetrahydroaminoacndine (tacnne) toward AChE as compared with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in human cortex. The results show that methanesulfonyl fluoride is selective as an inhibitor of AChE as compared with BChE. Physostigmine inhibited AChE more than BChE. Metrifonate was found to inhibit BChE more than AChE. Tetrahydroaminoacridine inhib-ited both enzymes in a complex way. Treatments for senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) facilitating cholinergic function in the central ner-vous system assume that a reduction in cholinergic function is one of the causes of dementia, at least <b>in</b> <b>part</b> (<b>e.</b> g., Davies, 1981; Drachman and Glossar, 1981).

40|$|This paper posits a (very British!) call to arms, {{and does}} so in five steps. In part A we address the need for {{constitutional}} fictions by which the many surrender political power to the few, in the same of stability, order and security. In part B, however, we seek to show that conflict is both a necessary and core principle of political constitutionalism – {{that it is the}} latent possibility of conflict, the (re) awakening of the many where the few abuse that power, that acts as the final check on government. In part C, we trace the steps by which recent re-interpretations of the work of J. A. G. Griffith – with a focus on the work of Tomkins and Bellamy - have reduced politics to its parliamentary form, thereby closing (rather than “enlarging”) the “areas for argument and discussion” (a narrow view of the constitution to which, admittedly, Griffith himself might have subscribed) and in so doing closing off the very possibility of a constitutional conflict between the rulers and the ruled out outwith existing institutional channels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The modest {{efficacy}} of available therapies for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) indicates {{the need to}} develop novel therapeutic approaches. For the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BZB), potentially attractive for HCC treatment, the mechanism of action is largely unknown. The BZB effect on E 2 Fs and the E 2 Fs control on the peptidylproline cis-trans isomerase (Pin 1), prompted us to explore the BZB effect on the Pin 1 -E 2 F 1 axis. METHODS: The tumorigenic cell line HuH 7 together with the non-tumorigenic cells IHH and the human pluripotent stem cell derived hepatocytes (hPSC-H), were used as cellular models of HCC and normal liver cells, respectively. RESULTS: BZB reduces HuH 7 growth as shown by cell counting, cell vitality test and cell cycle analysis; this is paralleled by the decrease of Pin 1, E 2 F 1, cyclin A 2 and of the hyper-phosphorylated pRB. Pin 1 -E 2 F 1 axis impairment justifies the anti-proliferative effect since Pin-E 2 F 1 depletion decreases HuH 7 growth while the over-expression rescues BZB-induced inhibition of proliferation. Moreover, Pin 1 -E 2 F 1 promote HuH 7 growth via the up-regulation of cyclin D 1, cyclin E, cyclin A 2, E 2 F 2 and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>E</b> 2 F 3. Finally, in the control cells IHH and hPSC-H, BZB effect on cell vitality is not irrelevant, a fact correlated to the cellular proliferation rate. Thus, BZB effect on healthy liver tissue may not be entirely negligible hence caution should be exercised in its use in liver regeneration processes. CONCLUSION: For the first time we prove the functional involvement of the Pin 1 -E 2 F 1 axis in the anti-proliferative effect of BZB indicating Pin 1 -E 2 F as an attractive target to control HCC cell growth...|$|E
40|$|Three polypeptides are {{produced}} {{from the major}} immediate-early (IE) region of human cytomegalovirus by alternative splicing. The IE gene products regulate subsequent viral and cellular gene expression. We previously reported that cotransfection of a genomic clone of the major IE region stimulated transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase driven by the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) promoter and that an intact E 2 F site was required for the trans activation (M. Wade, T. F. Kowalik, M. Mudryj, E. -S. Huang, and J. C. Azizkhan, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12 : 4364 - 4374, 1992). With the availability of cDNA clones for the individual major IE proteins, we sought to determine which of these proteins exerted this effect and whether the IE protein(s) interacted with E 2 F. In this study, we use cotransfection {{to demonstrate that the}} 55 - and 86 -kDa major IE proteins from the IE 2 region can each moderately trans activate the DHFR promoter and that the 72 -kDa IE 1 protein stimulates DHFR transcription to a much higher level.

We also demonstrate by in vitro pull-down assays that the 72 -kDa IE 1 protein can specifically interact with the DNA binding domain of E 2 F 1 (amino acids 88 to 191) in the presence of nuclear extract. Moreover, antibodies to either E 2 F 1 or IE 72 will immunoprecipitate both E 2 F and IE 72 from cells that stably express IE 72, and antibody to E 2 F 1 will immunoprecipitate IE 72 from normal human fibroblast cells infected with human cytomegalovirus...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is entitled}} Knowledge and curiosity: Remarkable readings of three Norwegian text-montages {{for children and}} adolescent, and is divided into five equal parts and one appendix. The link between knowledge and curiosity can be traced in the span between the known and the unknown, the usual or ordinary and the unusual and extraordinary. What is unknown, unusual and extraordinary is called a curiosity. A curiosity is something remarkable, something strange, odd, and peculiar that has awaken our inquisitiveness. In Latin the noun cura means care, concern, carefulness. From cura the adjective curiosus is derived meaning careful, observant and concerned (as in cura-tor). The noun curiosum is probably a newer, scholarly variant of the word and means ‘something that makes us curious’. While knowledge is something known, something already there, a curiosity is something we find by employing a curious and observant gaze, and something {{we want to take}} care of, to care about and to collect. Part A introduces the three text-montages that are the focus of the dissertation: Einar Økland’s epistles Ingenting meir (1976, trans. Nothing more), Svein Nyhus’ picture book Verden har ingen hjørner (1999 / 2002, trans. The world has no corners) and Ragnar Hovland’s encyclopaedia-like Verdt å vite [trur eg] (2002, trans. Worth knowing [I think]). It also introduces the works of Walter Benjamin, which provide the thematic, methodical and theoretical guidelines of the dissertation. Secondly, Part A presents the notion of montage, provides examples and argues for its use as a method both for reading the three text-montages and for structuring the dissertation itself. Finally, an outline is provides of the main perspectives from which the three text-montages are viewed: those of the collector, of the collections and collecting; those of topography and topology; those of the biography; and those of knowledge and curiosity. Part B focuses on the montages of Økland, Nyhus and Hovland as text collections and on the authors as collector. There are three guiding questions: how do the collectors collect, how are the collections ordered, and what is collected? These questions are related to relevant texts by Benjamin, such as “The Collector”, “ The Cultural History of Toys” (my trans.), “Russian Toys” (my trans.), “Toy wandering in Berlin” I and II (my trans.) and Berlin Childhood Around 1900. The questions of how to order a collection and how to order a text are closely related {{to the ways in which}} one orientates oneself to different guidelines and follows these. Part C, therefore, studies various texts by Benjamin, Økland, Nyhus and Hovland that demonstrate the link between geography and geometry, and the link between topography and topology: i. e. the relationship between being able to read a map or a landscape and being able to read a literary text. If one can claim that topographic texts are spatial texts, one can also claim that biographies are linear texts. It is the meeting point between biography and topography in which I am interested, on the grounds that to write about someone’s life also means to map that person’s life. Part D of the dissertation challenges traditional patterns of biographical writing using examples from texts by Benjamin, Økland, Nyhus and Hovland. The analysis in Parts C and D conclude with the suggestion that one should view these three text-montages as an opportunity to learn how to lose one’s way and the value of going astray. Getting lost or going astray situates the readers outside the system, thereby enabling them to understand or orient themselves from a new or different point of view. According to Benjamin: ”Not to find one’s way around a city does not mean much. But to lose one’s way in a city, as one loses one’s way in a forest, requires some schooling” (Benjamin 2006, 53). The examinations of the various topographical and biographical texts are linked to different questions about knowledge: “Where is knowledge?”, “How is knowledge collected and ordered?” and “What is the value of knowledge?”. These questions are the focal point <b>in</b> <b>Part</b> <b>E.</b> The first question is answered on the basis of a text by Økland which maintains that knowledge can also be sought in remote corners and on the periphery. In answer to the second question, Nyhus’ illustrations and texts demonstrate that knowledge can be gathered and systemized in reliquaries, drawers and boxes. This understanding of knowledge may be read as a parallel to the epistemological value of the ‘Wunderkammer’ or ‘Raritäten- Kabinett’. The final question, regarding the value of knowledge, is adressed in relation to Hovland’s Verdt å vite [trur eg] and the science of pataphysics. One definition of pataphysics is that it is the science of exceptions. For Hovland, as well as for Økland and Nyhus, it is the exceptions, the particular and the curious details that are of epistemological value. In the appendix of my dissertation, five future fields of investigation arising from my analysis are indicated: “The activity of collecting in modern, Norwegian picture books”, “Topographical children’s literature”, “Biographies for children and adolescent”, “Animal’s significance in children’s literature” and “Children’s encyclopaedia”. This study demonstrates that the concept of the montage is a useful analytic tool. The dissertation Knowledge and curiosity: Remarkable readings of three Norwegian textmontages for children and adolescent offers experimental readings of three important Norwegian authors, and traces the connection between the way a text is organized and the way knowledge is understood...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} related theoretical studies of pyrochlore titanate oxides, boron nitride nanotubes, and multiferroic bismuth ferrite. We have investigated these systems at high pressures and at low temperatures using Raman spectroscopy. Below, we furnish a synoptic presentation {{of our work}} on these three systems. In Chapter 1, we introduce the systems studied in this thesis, viz. pyrochlores, boron nitride nanotubes, and multiferroic BiFeO 3, with {{a review of the}} literature pertaining to their structural, electronic, vibrational, and mechanical properties. We also bring out our interests in these systems. Chapter 2 includes a brief description of the theory of Raman scattering and infrared absorption. This is followed by a short account of the experimental setups used for Raman and infrared measurements. We also present the technical details of high pressure technique including the alignment of diamond anvil cells, gasket preparation, calibration of the pressure, etc. Chapter 3 furnishes the results of our pressure-and temperature-dependent studies of pyrochlore oxides which has been divided into eight different parts. In recent years, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of pyrochlores have received a lot of attention. However, not much work has been reported to address the quasiparticle excitations, e. g., phonons and crystal-field excitations in these materials. A material that shows exotic magnetic behavior and high degree of degenerate ground states can be expected to have low-lying excitations with possible couplings with phonons, thereby, finger-printing various novel properties of the system. Raman and infrared absorption spectroscopies can, therefore, be used to comprehend the novel role of phonons and their role in various phenomena of frustrated magnetic pyrochlores. Recently, there have been reports on various novel properties of these systems; for example, Raman and absorption studies [Phys. Rev. B 77, 214310 (2008) ] have revealed a loss of inversion symmetry in Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 at low temperatures which has been suggested as the key reason for this frustrated magnet to remain in spin-liquid state down to 70 mK. Powder neutron-diffraction experiments [Nature 420, 54 (2002) ] have shown that an application of isostatic pressure of about 8. 6 GPa in spin-liquid Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 induces a long-range magnetic order of the Tb 3 + spins coexisting with the spin-liquid phase ascribing this transition to the breakdown of the delicate balance among the various fundamental interactions. Moreover, Raman and x-ray studies have shown that Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7,Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7,and Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 undergo a structural transition followed by an irreversible amorphization at very high pressures (~ 40 GPa or above) [Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 031903 (2006) ]. In this chapter, therefore, we present our temperature-and pressure-dependent Raman studies of A 2 Ti 2 O 7 pyrochlores, where ‘A’ is a trivalent rare-earth element (A = Sm, Gd,Tb, Dy,Ho, Er,Yb, and Lu; and also Y). Since all the group theoretically predicted Raman modes of this cubic lattice are due to oxygen vibrations only, in Part (A), we revisit the phonon assignments of pyrochlore titanates by performing Raman measurements on the O 16 /O 18 − isotope based Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Lu 2 Ti 2 O 7 and find that the vibrations with frequencies below 250 cm− 1 do not involve oxygen atoms. Our results lead to a reassignment of the pyrochlore Raman phonons thus proposing that the mode with frequency ~ 200 cm− 1, which has earlier been known as an F 2 g phonon due to oxygen vibration, is a vibration of Ti 4 + ions. Moreover, we have performed lattice dynamical calculations using Shell model that help us to assign the Raman phonons. In Part (B), we have explored the temperature dependence of the Raman phonons of spin-ice Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 and compared with the results of two non-magnetic pyrochlores, Lu 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Y 2 Ti 2 O 7. Our results reveal anomalous red-shift of some of the phonons in both magnetic and non-magnetic pyrochlores as the temperature is lowered. The phonon anomalies can not be understood in terms of spin-phonon and crystal field transition-phonon couplings, thus attributing them to phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions. We also find that the anomaly of the disorder activated Ti 4 + Raman vibration (~ 200 cm− 1) is unusually high compared to other phonons due to the large vibrational amplitudes of Ti 4 +-ions rendered by the vacant Wyckoff sites in their neighborhood. Later, we have quantified the anharmonicity in Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7. We have extended our studies on spin-ice compound Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 by performing simultaneous pressure-and temperature-dependent Raman measurements, presented in Part (C). We show that a new Raman mode appears at low temperatures below TC ~ 110 K, suggesting a structural transition, also supported by our x-ray measurements. There are reports [Phys. Rev. B 77, 214310 (2008), Phys. Rev. B 79, 214437 (2009) ] in the literature where the new mode in Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 at low temperatures has been assigned to a crystal field transition. Here, we put forward evidences that suggest that the “new” mode is a phonon and not a crystal field transition. Moreover, the TC is found to depend on pressure with a positive coefficient. In Part (D), we have presented our results of temperature-and pressure-dependent Raman and x-ray measurements of spin-frustrated pyrochlores Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7, Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7,and Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7. Here, we have estimated the quasiharmonic and anharmonic contributions to the anomalous change in phonon frequencies with temperature. Moreover, we find that Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 undergo a subtle structural transition at a pressure of ~ 9 GPa which is absent in Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7. The implication of this structural transition in the context of a long-range magnetically ordered state coexisting with the spin-liquid phase in Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 at high pressure (8. 6 GPa) and low temperature (1. 5 K), observed by Mirebeau et al. [Nature 420, 54 (2002) ], has been discussed. As we have established in the previous parts that the anomalous behavior of pyrochlore phonons is due to phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions, we have tuned the anharmonicity in the first pyrochlore of the A 2 Ti 2 O 7 series, i. e., Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7,by replacing Ti 4 +-ions with bigger Zr 4 +-ions, presented <b>in</b> <b>Part</b> (<b>E).</b> Our results suggest that the phonon anomalies have a very strong dependence on the ionic size and mass of the transition element (i. e., the B 4 +-ion in A 2 B 2 O 7 pyrochlores). We have also observed signatures of coupling between a phonon and crystal-field transitions in Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7. In Part (F), we have studied spin-ice compound Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 and compared the phonon anomalies with the stuffed spin-ice compounds, Ho 2 +xTi 2 −xO 7 −x/ 2 by stuffing Ho 3 + ions into the sites of Ti 4 + with appropriate oxygen stoichiometry. We find that as more and more Ho 3 +-ions are stuffed, there is an increase in the structural disorder of the pyrochlore lattice and the phonon anomalies gradually disappear with increasing Ho 3 +-ions. Moreover, a coupling between phonon and crystal field transition has also been observed. In Part (G), we have examined the temperature dependence of phonons of “dynamical spin-ice” compound Pr 2 Sn 2 O 7 and compared with its non-pyrochlore (monoclinic) counterpart Pr 2 Ti 2 O 7. Our results conclude that the anomalous behavior of phonons is an intrinsic property of pyrochlore structure having inherent vacant sites. We also find a coupling between phonon and crystal-field transitions in Pr 2 Sn 2 O 7. In the last part of this chapter, Part (H), we present our Raman studies of Er 2 Ti 2 O 7. Here, we show that in addition to the anomalous phonons, there are modes that originate from photoluminescence transitions and some of these luminescence lines show anomalous temperature dependence which have been understood using the theory of optical dephasing in crystals, developed by Hsu and Skinner [J. Chem. Phys. 81, 1604 (1984) ]. Temperature dependence of a few Raman modes and photoluminescence bands suggest a phase transition at 130 K. In Chapter 4, we furnish our pressure-dependent Raman studies of boron nitride multi-walled nanotubes (BNNT) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and compare the results with those of their carbon counterparts. Using Raman spectroscopy, we show that BNNT undergo an irreversible transition at ~ 12 GPa while the carbon counterpart, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, show a similar transition at a much higher pressure of ~ 51 GPa. In sharp contrast, the layered form of both the systems (i. e. h-BN and graphite) undergo a hexagonal to wurtzite phase at nearly similar pressure (~ 13 GPa of h-BN and ~ 15 GPa for graphite). A molecular dynamical simulation on boron nitride single-walled nanotubes has also been undertaken that suggests that the polar nature of the B−N bonds may be responsible for the irreversibility of the pressure-induced transformations. It is interesting to see that in hexagonal phase both the systems have almost similar mechanical property, but once they are rolled up to make nanotubes, the property becomes quite different. Chapter 5 presents the temperature dependence of the Raman modes of multiferroic thin films of BiFeO 3 and Bi 0. 7 Tb 0. 2 La 0. 1 O 3. Though there have been several Raman investigations of BiFeO 3 in literature, here we emphasize the observation of unusually intense second order Raman phonons. Our results have motivated Waghmare et al. to suggest a theoretical model to explain the anomalously large second order Raman tensor of BiFeO 3 in terms of an incipient metal-insulator transition. In Chapter 6, we summarize our findings on the three different systems, namely, pyrochlores, boron nitride nanotubes, and BiFeO 3 and highlight a few possible experiments that may be undertaken in future to have a better understanding of these systems...|$|E

The proposed model minimizes total transportation and installation costs of a mixed fleet dispatching system combining relay network and point-to-point dispatching. Operational constraints such as maximum driver tour length and load circuity are considered within the variable definition using predefined templates to generate feasible routes. High quality solutions for largely-sized problem instances are obtained in reasonable times. Computational results are analyzed to develop insights about the mixed fleet dispatching system and quantify its benefits over relay network-only and point-to-point dispatching...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: High {{coverage}} of conventional and long-lasting insecticide treated nets (ITNs and LLINs) <b>in</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>E</b> Africa {{are associated with}} reductions in local malaria burdens. Shifts in malaria vector species ratio have coincided with the scaleup suggesting that some species are being controlled by ITNs/LLINs better than others. Methods: Between 2005 – 2006 six experimental hut trials of ITNs and LLINs were conducted in parallel at two field stations in northeastern Tanzania; the first station was in Lower Moshi Rice Irrigation Zone, an area where An. arabiensi...|$|R
40|$|This {{invaluable}} monograph {{has arisen}} <b>in</b> <b>part</b> from <b>E</b> Witten's lectures on topological {{quantum field theory}} {{in the spring of}} 1989 at Princeton University. At that time Witten unified several important mathematical works in terms of quantum field theory, most notably the Donaldson polynomial, the Gromov-Floer homology and the Jones polynomials. In his lectures, among other things, Witten explained his intrinsic three-dimensional construction of Jones polynomials via Chern-Simons gauge theory. He provided both a rigorous proof of the geometric quantization of the Chern-Simons action and a very il...|$|R
