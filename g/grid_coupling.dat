Each grid was able to accept one of the incoming signals, and the non-linearity of the device produced the sum and difference frequencies. The valve would have been very inefficient, but, most importantly, the capacitive coupling between the two grids would have been very large.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on the power {{electronic}} converter system challenges associated with the grid integration of variable-renewable-energy (VRE) sources like wave, marine current, tidal, wind, solar etc. Wave energy conversion with grid integration is used as the key reference, considering its high energy potential to support the future clean energy requirements and due {{the availability of a}} test facility at Uppsala University. The emphasis is on the DC-link power conditioning and <b>grid</b> <b>coupling</b> of direct driven wave energy converters (DDWECs). The DDWEC reflects the random nature of its input energy to its output voltage wave shape. Thereby, it demands for intelligent power conversion techniques to facilitate the grid connection. One option is to improve and adapt an already existing, simple and reliable multilevel power converter technology, using smart control strategies. The proposed WECs to grid interconnection system consists of uncontrolled three-phase rectifiers, three-level boost converter(TLBC) or three-level buck-boost converter (TLBBC) and a three-level neutral point clamped (TLNPC) inverter. A new method for pulse delay control for the active balancing of DC-link capacitor voltages by using TLBC/TLBBC is presented. Duty-ratio and pulse delay control methods are combined for obtaining better voltage regulation at the DC-link and for achieving higher controllability range. The classic voltage balancing problem of the NPC inverter input, is solved efficiently using the above technique. A synchronous current compensator is used for the NPC inverter based <b>grid</b> <b>coupling.</b> Various results from both simulation and hardware testing show that the required power conditioning and power flow control can be obtained from the proposed multilevel multistage converter system.

The productivity of a computer user is direcLly related to this turnaround time. In a timesharing environment, the improvement in this speed is achieved when multiple processors are used efficiently to execute an algorithm. We apply the concept of multiple instructions and multiple data (MIMD) through multit_sking via a strategy which requires relatively minor modifications to an existing code fl_r a single processor.

The main goal is to define the best sizing for a hybrid power plant to serve the micro <b>grid,</b> <b>coupling</b> a solar PV array with a storage system and a diesel genset. The first step of the study case consists of defining the energy needs of the village in order to draw its consumption curve and assume its evolution over time. Then a model of the hybrid power plant was built in Matlab and Simulink. It simulates the behavior of the power plant components – mainly the solar power plant, the storage system, the genset and the energy management system – and the interactions between these elements. The model is then used in order to run simulations according to four scenarios corresponding to four different power plant configurations: genset standalone power plant, genset & solar power plant, genset & solar & storage automatically operated, and genset & solar & storage manually operated. For each one of these scenarios, simulations were run and the optimal sizing and settings were defined according to different criteria related mainly to the fuel consumption, the genset penetration and the cost of electricity. The different scenarios and consequently the related hybrid plant configurations were compared according to the abovementioned criteria and an optimal design was selected, allowing the best trade-off between the cost of electricity and the genset penetration. This solution should guarantee a reliable and affordable access to electricity for this village over the assumed lifetime of ten years. ...|$|E

By con-struction of surface freshwater and heat fluxes, the model multi-year ensemble mean annual cycle surface layer temperature and salinity converge to the climatological cycle. Hellerman annual cycle wind forcing is used. The duo grid resolutions are: 1 / 2 ◦ east of 60 ◦ W; 1 / 6 ◦ west of 60 ◦ W; 30 z-levels. Upwind-based fluxes across 60 ◦ W give nearly seamless <b>grid</b> <b>coupling.</b> Open boundary conditions derived from a one degree resolution global model are applied at 10 ◦ N.

40|$|With large {{wind energy}} {{integration}} into power systems, wind farms begin to influence power systems {{in a much}} more significant manner. As wind energy systems utilize different generator technologies from the one utilized in the conventional power plants, the steady-state, transient and small-signal dynamics, as well as, power system stability will thus be significantly affected. The impact of wind energy systems on the power system dynamics and stability is thus of practical importance. As there is a significant increase in installation of wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) in recent years, a dynamic model of the DFIG wind turbine is firstly developed in this thesis. The model is validated against field measurement data, and the validation gives confidence about the accuracy and applicability of the developed model. DFIG wind farms consist of tens to hundreds of identical DFIG wind turbines increasing the complexity of the wind farm model and simulation time. A novel aggregation technique is developed in this thesis that incorporates a multiplication factor, namely mechanical torque compensation factor (MTCF), to the mechanical torque of the full aggregated wind farm model. The MTCF is initially constructed to approximate a Gaussian function by using fuzzy logic method. By optimizing the MTCF on a trial and error basis, less than 10 percent discrepancy is then achieved between the proposed aggregated model and the complete model. The proposed aggregation technique is then applied to a 120 MVA offshore wind farm comprising of 72 DFIG wind turbines and shows higher accuracy in approximating the wind farm dynamics as it appears at the point of common coupling (PCC) as compared to the full aggregated model. The proposed aggregated model computes faster than the complete wind farm model by 90. 3 percent during normal operations and 87 percent during grid disturbances. To overcome the adverse effects due to the fluctuating nature of wind, two wind power smoothing methods are proposed using a fuzzy logic pitch angle controller for a smooth performance with a minimum drop in output power. One method performs partial smoothing with only 4. 74 percent drop in the output power while the other method offers complete smoothing with a 8. 28 percent drop in output power. The impact of wind energy integration on power system transient stability (PSTS) is studied quantitatively with the transient energy margin (TEM), which is calculated through the evaluation of the transient energy function (TEF). This study is carried out in two ways in the thesis. One is to analyse the impact of transient fault on the DFIG wind turbine as compared to SGs for different factors, like the fault clearing time, the <b>grid</b> <b>coupling,</b> the inertia constant and the voltage sag. The study reveals that transient stability of the DFIG wind turbine is hardly affected by the <b>grid</b> <b>coupling,</b> the inertia constant and the generator terminal voltage sag variations indicating its consistent transient performance within a wide range of these factors. The fault clearing time should be almost 11 percent faster for the system with the DFIG than the synchronous generator (SG). The other is to investigate the impact of the DFIG wind farm on the PSTS with the variation of different factors, which are the voltage sag, the fault clearing time, the load and the wind power penetration level. The study reveals that power systems integrated with DFIG wind farms are sensitive to transient events with high voltage sag, high fault clearing time, low load operation and high wind power penetration level. Machines at different locations individually possess distinct fault response and suffer from a large-scale power imbalance. As a result, reliable operation of DFIG wind farm integrated power systems demands upgraded equipment, such as advanced switchgear, fast breakers/isolators, efficient power reserve systems and advanced reactive power compensating device, etc...|$|E

With respect to the hybrid energy characteristics, both demonstration sites are quite distinct. At the demonstration site in Sweden, the reduction of vertical production (driven unsustainable with fossil fuel) is in the centre of the targeted control strategies.
