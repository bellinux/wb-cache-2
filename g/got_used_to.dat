Most small scale FARC attacks during this period were intended to gain captured military equipment of diverse origin. Later on, the FARC gradually <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> newer weapons and equipment such as Russian made AK-47 assault rifle and eventually also obtained some advanced communication technology, systems which are very useful in warfare for coordination among guerrilla fighting units.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the fact that it did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

In fact, they were simply palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters.

He {{eventually}} was racing at several different tracks in his home area: GSR Kartway near Clintonville, Wisconsin, Hi-Go Raceway in Cecil, Wisconsin and Meadowview Kartway by Hilbert, Wisconsin. Between 2005 and 2009, he had won five track titles and 84 features. By {{the time that he}} was 15 year old, he had won a national championship in the Mid-American National Series. In karting, he had won six national championships, three state championships, and five track titles. In 2009, Majeski took second overall in the National Indoor Championship at Batesville, Mississippi; he won three of five events which caught the attention of Bobby Waltrip, the brother of Darrell and Michael Waltrip.

500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E

Natives of the Philippines are {{reported}} to have a tendency to [...] "sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations". Thomeczeck stated, [...] "The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance. Whatever they are in a natural way, they can continue that habit in prison." [...] Despite other colleagues' enthusiasm about the dancing, chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology was worried about the volume of inmates dancing, as CPDRC was undermanned. Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center's Operations Manual, Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen. [...] "As a jail officer, I got worried when I saw it", Rubio commented. The inmates were not fond of the idea either, pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison. Prisoners eventually agreed to dance, but admitted that the routines took awhile to master. [...] "It was difficult at first, but eventually we inmates <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it", inmate Mario Benito revealed.

500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E
500|$|Goater's trial {{resulted}} in the offer of a professional contract, {{but he did not}} break into the first team. In 1989, Goater signed for Rotherham United in order to play first team football. At this time, Goater suffered homesickness, finding it difficult to adapt to the English climate: [...] "It took me a good two years to get used to life in England. At first I thought the sun never shone and it wasn't for me." [...] However, he gradually <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> living in England, and over the course of seven seasons at Rotherham he gained a reputation as a reliable lower division striker, scoring 86 goals in 262 appearances, with a winner's medal for the 1996 Auto Windscreens Shield the highlight. A 1992 League Cup tie against Everton gave Goater his first experience of playing against a Premier League team. In the first leg, Goater scored the only goal of the game as Rotherham won 1–0. However, Everton won the return leg 3–0 and Rotherham were eliminated. In 1993, Goater also had a brief loan spell at Notts County, though he made only one appearance for the Nottingham club due to a work permit problem. Towards the end of the 1995–96 season, Goater had a disagreement with Rotherham manager Archie Gemmill, and decided his future lay elsewhere.|$|E

After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because [...] "there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing." [...] In the episode [...] "Normandy", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted {{in the form of a}} female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality).|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on.

500|$|According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote {{more than half of the}} album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases. Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with three songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Penny Lane". The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron, the keys of which triggered tape-recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using those voices. McCartney performed the introduction to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] using the flute setting. The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of Revolver, [...] "we had <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary." [...] In Martin's opinion, Sgt. Pepper [...] "grew naturally out of Revolver", marking [...] "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".|$|E
