40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and REM sleep {{behavior}} disorder (RBD) show mostly unimpaired motor {{behavior during}} REM sleep, which contrasts strongly to coexistent nocturnal bradykinesia. The {{reason for this}} sudden amelioration of motor control in REM sleep is unknown, however. We set out to determine whether movements during REM sleep are processed by different motor networks than movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state. We recorded local field potentials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subthalamic nucleus (STN) and scalp EEG (modified 10 / 20 montage) during sleep in humans with PD and RBD. Time-locked event-related β band oscillations were calculated during movements in REM sleep compared with movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state and during NREM sleep. Spectral analysis of STN local field potentials revealed elevated β power during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep and β power in REM sleep reached levels similar as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state. Event-related analysis showed time-locked β desynchronization during WAKE movements. In contrast, we found significantly elevated β activity before and during movements in REM sleep and NREM sleep. Corticosubthalamic coherence was reduced during REM and NREM movements. We conclude that sleep-related movements are not processed by the same corticobasal ganglia network as movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state. Therefore, <b>the</b> well-known seemingly normal motor performance during RBD in PD patients might be generated by activating alternative motor networks for movement initiation. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} pathological movement-inhibiting basal ganglia networks in PD patients are bypassed during sleep. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study provides evidence that nocturnal movements during REM sleep in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are not processed by the same corticobasal ganglia network as movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state. This implicates the existence of an alternative motor network that does not depend directly on the availability of l-Dopa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basal ganglia. These findings further indicate that some PD patients are able to perform movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dopamine depleted state, possibly by bypassing the pathological basal ganglia network. The existence and direct activation of such alternative motor networks might finally have potential therapeutic effects for PD patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the effects of lesions of the septohippocampal system on hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) and large amplitude irregular activity (LIA). Slow wave activity was recorded from rat hippocampus during waking behaviors and following the administration of atropine or urethane after either an intraseptal injection of ibotenic acid, an intracerebroventricular injection of ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF 64 A) or control solutions. Hippocampal activity was also investigated during quiet and active sleep following ibotenic acid or control treatment.;Ibotenic acid selectively abolished the atropine-sensitive form of RSA normally seen during tonic periods of active sleep and during urethane anesthesia. LIA and RSA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state were somewhat reduced in amplitude but clear RSA persisted during Type 1 behavior (walking, struggling) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state and during phasic muscle twitches in active sleep. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state, <b>the</b> surviving RSA was resistant to atropine, as in normal rats. Analysis of brain sections (Nissl or acetylcholinesterase stains) indicated that ibotenic acid produced cell loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dorsal lateral septal and the septohippocampal nuclei. Cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medial septal and diagonal band nuclei appeared to be resistant to the ibotenic acid. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> and <b>the</b> sleeping state, RSA can be produced by either of two distinctive inputs to the hippocampus. Furthermore, intrinsic septal circuitry appears to be critically involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generation of atropoine-sensitive (presumably cholinergic) RSA. No support was found for the idea that RSA during active sleep has a different basis than RSA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waking</b> state.;AF 64 A treated rats showed a significantly smaller increase in 6 - 12 Hz hippocampal activity during struggling than did control rats. However, AF 64 A did not abolish the presumed cholinergic form of RSA present during urethane anesthesia. Atropine did not alter <b>the</b> RSA seen <b>in</b> <b>waking</b> AF 64 A treated rats. Analysis of brain sections revealed extensive damage to the fimbria, fornix, corpus callosum, CA 3 of the hippocampus, neocortex and striatum. Hippocampal acetylcholinesterase staining appeared normal following AF 64 A. These data suggest that AF 64 A is not a selective cholinotoxin since it produces considerable damage to noncholinergic tissue. The apparent selective reduction in hippocampal cholinergic markers suggested by biochemical studies of AF 64 A may reflect its ability to damage the fimbria and fornix, the major route by which cholinergic septohippocampal neurons reach the hippocampus...|$|R
