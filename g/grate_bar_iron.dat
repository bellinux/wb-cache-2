60|$|The Lords of Burgundy retired, much {{pleased with}} the grace of Louis's manner, and the artful {{distribution}} of his attentions; and the King was left with {{only one or two}} of his own personal followers, under the archway of the base court of the Castle of Peronne, looking on the huge tower which occupied one of the angles, being in fact the Donjon, or principal Keep, of the palace. This tall, dark, massive building was seen clearly by the same moon which was lighting Quentin Durward betwixt Charleroi and Peronne, which, as the reader is aware, shone with peculiar lustre. The great Keep was in form nearly resembling the White Tower in the Citadel of London, but still more ancient in its architecture, deriving its date, as was affirmed, from the days of Charlemagne. The walls were of a tremendous thickness, the windows very small, and <b>grated</b> with <b>bars</b> of <b>iron,</b> and the huge clumsy bulk of the building cast a dark and portentous shadow over the whole of the courtyard.|$|R
60|$|Up {{and down}} {{the height of the}} tower were {{scattered}} three or four windows, the lower ones <b>grated</b> with <b>iron</b> <b>bars,</b> the upper ones vacant both of window frames and glass. Besides these larger openings, there were several loopholes and little square apertures, which might be supposed to light the staircase, that doubtless climbed the interior towards the battlemented and machicolated summit. With this last-mentioned warlike garniture upon its stern old head and brow, the tower seemed evidently a stronghold of times long past. Many a crossbowman had shot his shafts from those windows and loop-holes, and from the vantage height of those gray battlements; many a flight of arrows, too, had hit all round about the embrasures above, or the apertures below, where the helmet of a defender had momentarily glimmered. On festal nights, moreover, a hundred lamps had often gleamed afar over the valley, suspended from the iron hooks that were ranged for the purpose beneath the battlements and every window.|$|R

The paper discusses the conditions of the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> of conveyor roasting and sintering machines wear, depending on the adopted loading schemes. The materials to be processed can be loaded directly from the hopper (direct download) or through the use of a feeder (drum-type feeder, roller, etc.). A simplified method to predict the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> surface wear on the strength of a number of assumptions has been developed: normal reaction of the pallet surface to the impact of the batch is assumed constant, equal to the maximum of its value when the pallet is in horizontal position; a layer of the batch moves as a rigid body; surface batch layer sliding velocity as related to the pallet surface is taken medium during the relative motion of the layer and equal to the linear velocity of the pallets; the side faces of the <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> wear is related to related to the surface wear by linear dependence. The dependence of the wear on the friction forces and the steel wear resistance coefficient has been found ou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The as-cast {{structure}} of <b>grate</b> <b>bar</b> used in sintering trolley is primarily comprised of austenite and eutectic (eutectic austenite and eutectic carbide). The austenite is dendrite, while the carbide is reticular and chrysanthemum-like. The <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> were {{quenched and tempered}} under various temperature (one set of samples: quenching (975 ~ 1050 °C); the other: quenching (1000 °C) + tempering (240 ~ 600 °C)). With rise in quenching temperature, the content of martensite increases and gradually stabilizes, and the hardness increases and then decreases (the maximum is 61. 5 HRC). For the tempered simple, the strip-like carbides gradually become smaller, shorter and homogenized; the resistance to temper softening is high and the maximum hardness is 58 HRC; the wear resistance gradually decreases and is {{lower than that of}} as-cast one when the temperature is higher than 480 °C. The heat treatment process to improve the service properties of <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> is: quenching (1000 °C, 2. 5 h, and air-cooling) + tempering (300 ~ 420 °C, 2. 5 h, and air-cooling) ...|$|R

50|$|Many inlets have {{gratings}} or grids {{to prevent}} people, vehicles, large objects or debris from {{falling into the}} storm drain. <b>Grate</b> <b>bars</b> are spaced so that {{the flow of water}} is not impeded, but sediment and many small objects can also fall through. However, if <b>grate</b> <b>bars</b> are too far apart, the openings may present a risk to pedestrians, bicyclists, and others in the vicinity. Grates with long narrow slots parallel to traffic flow are of particular concern to cyclists, as the front tire of a bicycle may become stuck, causing the cyclist to go over the handlebars or lose control and fall. Storm drains in streets and parking areas must be strong enough to support the weight of vehicles, and are often made of cast iron or reinforced concrete.|$|R

The project was concerned {{with the role of}} international commerce and mercantile networks in the early phases of British industrialisation. Specifically, it was concerned with the operation of the market for malleable <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> Between 1650 and 1800 domestic ironmasters were unable to meet the growing demand for <b>bar</b> <b>iron.</b> The shortfall was made good by imports from the Baltic, first from Sweden, then from Russia. The objective of the project was to uncover the links in the global commodity chain that stretched from the mining district of central Sweden to Britain and beyond. By doing so, the destination of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> imports can be plotted, allowing regional markets and specialised production zones to be detected, illuminating the operation {{of one of the most}} important industrial commodity markets of the era. As a further step, the role of mercantile networks in Britain in developing new patterns of metalware manufacture, orientated upon export markets in the Atlantic world, is brought to light. Main Topics : The data collection comprises a complete record of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> sales by the Bristol iron merchant Graffin Prankard between 1732 and 1739. The date of the transaction, the name of the buyer, his or her location, the type of <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> sold, its weight, and its price (per ton) have been recorded. Each buyer is allotted a code to facilitate the sorting of this data by region...|$|R

50|$|Puddling was {{one step}} {{in one of}} the most {{important}} processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high-grade <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> (malleable wrought iron) during the Industrial Revolution. In the original puddling technique, molten iron in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods, which were consumed in the process. It was one of the first processes for making <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> without charcoal in Europe, although much earlier coal-based processes had existed in China. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of specialty steels.|$|R

50|$|The {{limitation}} of imported <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> to London and the dockyards was partly repealed in 1757 by 30 Geo. II c.16, duty-free imports to {{any part of}} Great Britain being permitted. A clause requiring <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> to be marked was similarly repealed as unnecessary. A part of the act was also repealed by the American dominions (Trade with) Act 1765, (5 Geo. III c.45). The whole Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1867, due to the replacement of colonial rule with the Dominion of Canada.|$|R

50|$|Dannemora is the {{location}} of an important iron ore mine, the Dannemora mine, which {{formed the basis of}} the iron industry in Uppland. It provided the raw material for about 20 finery forges that produced <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> for export. In England, iron produced from Dannemora ore, was known as oregrounds iron, after the port town of Öregrund. <b>Bar</b> <b>iron</b> from these forges was considered the best raw material for producing blister steel by the cementation process, owing mainly to the extremely low levels of sulphur and phosphorus in the ores but also to the relatively high manganese content.|$|R
5000|$|In the 16th {{century and}} the early 17th century, the Weald was {{a major source of}} iron for {{manufacture}} in London, peaking at over 9000 tons per year in the 1590s. [...] However, after 1650, Wealden production became increasingly focused on the production of cannon; and <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> was only produced for local consumption. This decline may have begun as early as the 1610s, when Midland ironware began to be sold in London. Certainly after Swedish iron began to be imported in large quantities after the Restoration, Wealden <b>bar</b> <b>iron</b> seems to have been unable to compete in the London market.|$|R
