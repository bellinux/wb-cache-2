50|$|Gerda Alexander (February 15, 1908 - February 21, 1994) was a Danish {{teacher who}} devised {{a method of}} {{self-development}} called <b>Eutony.</b> She was born in Wuppertal, Germany, but moved to Denmark in 1929.|$|E
40|$|Twenty six {{patients}} with dysphonia (different etiologies) were {{submitted to a}} voice therapy program involving the use of <b>Eutony.</b> In order to assess its efficacy, pre and post-treatment audio recordings were analysed and submitted to perceptual rating using GRBAS-I scale and acoustical analysis of fundamental frequency, jitter and shimmer. Aerodynamic data (Maximum Phonation Time & Estimated Subglottic Pressure) were {{also included in the}} voice quality assessment protocol. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to all patients to collect self-evaluation of voice quality and therapy outcomes. The study revealed a significant improvement lasting in time for two acoustic parameters : Jitter and Shimmer and five perceptual parameters : Grade, Roughness, Breath, Asthenia and Strain. Aerodynamic data showed slight improvements but no significant changes. Self evaluation questionnaires also tend to strengthen positive effects of therapy. Thus, this study supports the use of <b>Eutony</b> in vocal therapy for dysphonia. Its effects were shown to be measurable with both acoustical analysis and perceptual rating of voice quality.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review and}} {{summarize}} the methodological challenges {{in clinical trials}} of bodywork or handson mind-body therapies such as Feldenkrais Method, Alexander Technique, Trager Work, <b>Eutony,</b> Body Awareness Therapy, Breath Therapy, and Rolfing, and to discuss ways these challenges can be addressed. DESIGN: Review and commentary. METHODS: Search of databases PubMed and EMBASE and screening of bibliographies. Published clinical studies were included if they used individual hands-on approaches and a focus on body awareness, and were not based on technical devices. RESULTS: Of the 53 studies identified, 20 fulfilled inclusion criteria. No studies blinded subject to the treatment being given, but 5 used an alternative treatment and blinded participants to differential investigator expectations of efficacy. No study used a credible placebo intervention. No studies reported measures of patient expectations. Patient expectations have been measured in studies of other modalities but not of hands-on mind-body therapies. Options are presented for minimizing investigator and therapist bias and bias from differential patient expectations, and for maintaining some control for nonspecific treatment effects. Practical issues with recruitment and attrition resulting from volunteer bias are addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous clinical trials of hands-on complementary and alternative therapy interventions are scarce, needed, and feasible. Difficulties with blinding, placebo, and recruitment can be systematically addressed by various methods that minimize the respective biases. The methods suggested here may enhance the rigor of further explanatory trials...|$|E
