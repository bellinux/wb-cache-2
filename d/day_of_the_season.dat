5|$|Arsenal's {{dominance}} of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves on the final <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> to cap off a highly successful decade.|$|E

5|$|As {{the rivalry}} has {{intensified}} in recent years, the teams have battled more often for playoff position.

5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball {{at the end of}} the season.

On the last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players.|$|E

Match attendances were the highest they had ever been at Turf Moor, with an average gate of over 30,000. The highest attendance of the campaign was a crowd of 42,653, who saw Burnley beat Bolton Wanderers 3–1 on 26February 1921; the lowest was 22,000, for the match against Sunderland on the final <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|City {{reached the}} FA Cup final {{for the first}} time in their history in 1949, losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> ensured {{survival}} in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club's most prolific strikers. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, their longest period ever in the top flight.|$|E
5|$|Fahey {{started the}} first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> in the 1–1 away draw against Cork City.

He started the return leg in Tallaght, Pats lost 5–0. Fahey scored his first goal of the season against UCD in a 3–2 win.

They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated Crewe Alexandra in the semi-final by drawing the away tie and winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{featured}} {{rarely in}} his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against Sheffield United. One of these was in the away game on the opening <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> {{and the other two}} in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Benítez's squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain {{for the first time since}} his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4–3 win.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} {{to manage and}} change {{every aspect of the}} club, and took the decision to disassemble the club's scouting network to instead focus on local talent in Northumberland and Durham. His only major new signing of the 1974–75 season was Terry Cooper, a former Leeds United teammate. They adapted well to the First Division, finishing in seventh place, but would have finished fourth and qualified for Europe had Derby County not scored a last second goal against them on the last <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|He spent £200,000 on striker Andy Preece, {{and also}} brought in young defender Jason Lydiate and goalkeeper Steve Banks for the 1995–96 campaign.

They had won 2–0 away at Valley Parade, only to lose 3–0 in the return leg at Bloomfield Road. Chairman Owen Oyston, {{while he was in}} a prison cell, sacked Allardyce shortly after the play-off defeat. Allardyce then had a brief spell on the coaching staff under Peter Reid at Sunderland, working as director of the academy.|$|E
