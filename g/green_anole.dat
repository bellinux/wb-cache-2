50|$|The brown anole is {{normally}} a light brown color with darker brown to black markings on its back, and several tan to light color lines on its sides. Like other anoles, it can change color, {{in this case}} a darker brown to black. Its dewlap ranges from yellow to orange-red. The males can grow as large as their <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> male counterparts, around 17.8 - 20.3 cm long, with some individuals topping 22.9 cm. The females are also around the size of female green anoles: 7.6 - 15 cm. The male brown anole's head is smaller than that of the male <b>green</b> <b>anole.</b> Also, the brown anole's tail has a ridge that travels {{all the way up to}} behind the head, a feature the <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> lacks.|$|E

5000|$|The Hispaniolan <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> (Anolis chlorocyanus [...] ) is {{a species}} of anole endemic to the island of Hispaniola. It {{is very similar to}} the North American species, the <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> (Anolis carolinensis), but males have a light blue throat flap, instead of red. Females and juveniles may have darker green stripes lining the sides of their bodies, but males are often a pure bright green color. This species was {{introduced}} into the Florida Everglades and is considered invasive.|$|E
50|$|The Neotropical <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> (Anolis biporcatus) is {{a species}} of Anolis lizard, native to Central America and {{northern}} South America, from Mexico to Ecuador and Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|The Cuban <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> (Anolis porcatus) is {{a species}} of anole endemic to Cuba, though {{introduced}} populations exist in Florida and on Hispaniola. It {{is part of the}} A. carolinensis clade of anoles.|$|E
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} are accepted, Anolis carolinensis carolinensis and Anolis carolinensis seminolus, {{found in}} {{the northern and southern}} reaches of the species distribution respectively, and hence are also known as the northern and southern <b>green</b> <b>anoles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The typical {{breeding}} season for <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> starts {{as early as}} April and ends in late September, gonadal activity being largely regulated by photoperiod, enlarging in spring as the weather warms up and days lengthen, and then regressing in late summer.|$|R
40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>anoles</b> {{are small}} lizards of the Southeastern United States. They possess an {{extensible}} throat-fan called a dewlap. Males have larger dewlaps and display them {{more often than}} females. Displays occur during courtship, during agonistic interaction, and during encounters with potential predators. The size of the dewlap of male <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> is positively correlated with maximum bite force capacity. Bite force capacity, in turn, is predictive of the winner during agonistic interactions. The correlation between these traits suggests that dewlap size {{may be used as}} a reliable signal of maximum bite force capacity. In this dissertation, I address three components of this system. First, I manipulate dewlap size and stage interactions between male <b>green</b> <b>anoles.</b> By removing the correlation between dewlap size and bite force, I was able to show that during staged encounters, bite force is predictive of the winner, but dewlap size is not. In the second chapter, I test for potential costs due to an increased predation risk as a result of dewlap displays. I observed no difference in recapture rates between animals that were experimentally prevented from extending their dewlaps and control counterparts. However, other data suggest that the presence of a pink dewlap may increase risk of predation. These results suggest that though there may be a predation-based cost to dewlap displays, <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> use behavioral means to ameliorate this risk. Finally, I use a castration and hormone-replacement experiment to test whether testosterone mediates seasonal changes in dewlap size and bite force. I hypothesized that testosterone would mediate changes in both traits {{in order to maintain the}} correlation between them. However, I found no effect of testosterone on change in dewlap size or bite force performance. Another trait, sprint speed performance, was affected by hormone treatment in the breeding season such that animals with high levels of testosterone ran faster than animals from the other treatment groups. My results corroborate other research showing that hormones regulate plasticity in some systems, while other systems are insensitive. However, the mechanisms that regulate changes in the two components of the reliable signaling system in <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> remain unknown. ...|$|R

5000|$|Anolis allisoni {{is part of}} the carolinensis {{group of}} anoles, a clade of mid-sized trunk-crown anoles thought to have {{originated}} in Cuba.

50|$|A lack {{in one of}} {{the pigment}} genes causes color exceptions. These color {{mutations}} are also called phases. The rare blue-phased <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> lacks xanthophores, which results in a blue, rather than red, often pastel blue, anole. These specimens have become popular recently in the pet trade market. When the anole is completely lacking xanthophores, it is said to be axanthic and the animal will have a completely pastel- or baby-blue hue. They are extremely rare—usually produced in one of every 20,000 individual anoles in the wild. Another phase is the yellow-phased <b>green</b> <b>anole,</b> which lacks cyanophores. Colonies of these rare color-phased anoles have been reported, but anoles with these color mutations rarely live for long, since the green color provides camouflage for hunting down prey, as well as hiding from predators.|$|E
50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>anoles</b> {{may or may}} not adapt {{readily to}} cage life. Care must be used to make them happy to the best of one’s ability to {{compensate}} and aid them in adapting. Green anoles' nervous natures makes it advisable not to attempt to handle them very often.|$|R
50|$|Anolis cuvieri (Vernacular Spanish: lagarto verde, lagarto chipojo; Vernacular English: Puerto Rican giant <b>anole,</b> Cuvier's <b>anole,</b> <b>green</b> giant <b>anole.)</b> is {{a species}} of lizard endemic to Puerto Rico in the Dactyloidae family of the Squamata order. This reptile is common in the Toro Negro State Forest.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} anoles exhibit sexual dimorphism, which {{allows one to}} discern {{between males and females}} fairly easily with the naked eye. In <b>green</b> <b>anoles,</b> the female is {{characterized}} by a pale dorsal stripe extending from the neck to the tail, a generally smaller body, and a smaller head with a shorter snout. Female brown anoles share these characteristics, although their dorsal stripes are often wider, with diamond-shaped or squiggly edges. This stripe may be present sometimes in males, especially young ones not yet fully grown, but it is always fainter with less-defined edges. Some females have small dewlaps (pale and much smaller than those of the males).|$|R
50|$|Brown anoles feed {{on small}} {{arthropods}} such as crickets, moths, ants, grasshoppers, cockroaches, mealworms, spiders, and waxworms.They may also eat other lizards, {{such as the}} <b>green</b> <b>anole,</b> lizard eggs, and their own molted skin and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small fish - nearly anything that will fit in their mouths.|$|E
50|$|While {{nearly all}} anoles can change their color, {{the extent and}} {{variations}} of this ability differ widely throughout the individual species. For example, the <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> can change its color from a bright, leafy green to a dull brown color, while the Cuban brown can only change its shade of brown, along with the patterns on its back.|$|E
5000|$|Anoles {{are small}} and common lizards {{that can be found}} {{throughout}} the southeastern United States and at least as far west as San Antonio and Texas Hill Country, the Caribbean, Mexico, and various other warm regions of the Western world. A large majority of them sport a green coloration, including the only species native to the United States, the aptly named <b>green</b> <b>anole.</b> The <b>green</b> <b>anole</b> (and many other anoles) can change its color based on stress level, sun/light exposure and its surrounding. Although their color changing ability is very limited, often anoles are only able to change one color. Anoles are a very diverse and plentiful group of lizards, and about 372 species are known. The knight, green, bark, Jamaican giant, and Cuban brown anoles can all be found in the United States, primarily in Florida. The most prevalent of these species by far is the Cuban brown anole, which has pushed the native green (or [...] "Carolina") anole population farther north.|$|E
50|$|Females of {{the species}} are the most {{commonly}} seen in gardens. Their webs are usually characterized by a zigzag shaped stabilimentum (an extra thick line of silk) in the middle extending vertically. The spiders {{spend most of their}} time in their webs, waiting for prey to become ensnared. When prey becomes caught in the web, the spider may undulate the web back and forth to further trap the insect. When the prey is secure, the spider kills it by injecting its venom and then wraps the prey in a cocoon of silk for later consumption (typically 1-4 hours later). Prey includes small vertebrates, such as geckos and <b>green</b> <b>anoles,</b> as well as insects.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The copulatory {{system of}} <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> is highly sexually dimorphic. Males possess {{bilateral}} copulatory organs called hemipenes, each independently controlled by two muscles: the transversus penis (TPN) and retractor penis magnus (RPM). The TPN everts the hemipene through the cloaca and the RPM retracts it. Adult females {{do not possess}} hemipenes or either of these two muscles. The spinal nucleus projecting to the TPN and RPM contains more and larger motoneurons in males than females. Because anoles breed seasonally, two experiments were designed to test whether adult copulatory morphology varies with environmental condition, and if so, whether the effect is mediated by testicular androgens. Three groups of adult males were used in each experiment: males from breeding environmenta...|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} colour and morphology, Allison's anole is superficially {{similar to the}} better-known American <b>green</b> <b>anole.</b> While females are overall green with paler underparts, similar to the <b>green</b> <b>anole,</b> males have a reddish dewlap, and {{typically}} have bright blue heads, forelegs, and frontal half of the body (in specimens from Honduras, only the head is blue and the neck, limbs and lower body are bright green). In all specimens the throat is usually white. Both sexes are able to rapidly change their colour to brown. Females reach about 7.5 cm in snout-vent length and males about 10 cm. [...] It {{is one of the}} larger species in the carolinensis subgroup. Allison's anole is a typical trunk-crown anole. Like other anoles in the carolinensis subgroup, it has a large, conspicuously triangular-shaped head, and males have a prominent nuchal crest. This lizard has large subdigital toepads, which help facilitate climbing and clinging to vertical surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Threat {{displays}} {{are used}} to settle {{the vast majority of}} contests between <b>green</b> <b>anoles</b> (Anolis carolinensis). While these displays {{have been the subject of}} a number of studies, very little is understood about the information they convey. Theoretical models divide displays into several types of signals, based on the mechanism that stabilizes their use: 1) performance signals, 2) handicapping signals, or 3) conventional displays. The existence of performance displays has excellent empirical support, as do models of their use. Handicapped signalling models, especially those relating to mate-choice, have been highly influential, though little evidence suggests that threat displays are, in fact, handicapping. Most threat displays appear to be conventional, but little empirical work documents conventional signalling systems. This study investigated the use of headbob, pushup, and lateral compression displays, and concluded that headbob cadence, a discrete signal with three alternative rhythms, is a conventional display indicating impending escalation. Pushups and lateral compression displays appear not to be handicaps, since neither indicates impending escalation, and they do not correlate with fighting abilit...|$|R
40|$|Adult <b>green</b> <b>anoles,</b> Anolis carolinensis, exhibit {{numerous}} {{sex differences}} resulting from divergent strategies for maximizing reproductive success. I {{focused on the}} ontogeny of sex differences in behavior in juveniles, in relation to adult sex differences, by documenting the behavior of free-ranging juveniles, examining the structure and use of headbobbing displays, and determining {{the role of the}} androgen testosterone (T) in producing behavioral sex differences. Field observations indicated that juvenile males eat and forage actively more often than juvenile females. This divergent feeding behavior may result from sexual selection, given that body size is a major factor in determining the reproductive success of males. Analyses of headbobbing displays, used by adults in aggressive and sexual interactions, revealed that juvenile males and females each give the same three A, B, and C display types described for adults. However, there may be a maturational component to display structure, as juvenile displays differ from those of adults in within-display temporal structure, and are not as stereotyped. Concerning display use, social context affects neither the types of display interactions observed nor the rates of displays and related behaviors. However, size affects nearly every aspect of display behavior. Bot...|$|R
