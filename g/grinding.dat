50|$|Yields depend {{primarily}} on temperature, brew time, and <b>grind</b> size, {{and in a}} complex way on method. Yield is inverse to <b>grind</b> size (smaller <b>grinds</b> have more surface area, so extract faster) and increases roughly linear with time, as the extraction proceeds. Thus for a given temperature and <b>grind</b> size, there is an ideal brew time, with larger <b>grinds</b> requiring longer brewing. French press features the largest <b>grinds</b> of conventional methods, hence the longest brewing, {{on the order of}} 3-4 minutes, while filter coffee has smaller <b>grinds</b> and shorter brewing, and espresso has yet smaller <b>grinds</b> and shorter brewing, on the order of 20-30 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Whether a <b>grind</b> is back-side (BS) or front-side (FS) {{depends on}} how rider {{approaches}} the rail or edge. If the skater approaches the rail {{with his back to}} it, the <b>grind</b> is a back-side <b>grind.</b> If the skater approaches the rail with the front of his body to the rail, the <b>grind</b> is a front-side <b>grind.</b>|$|R

5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. <b>Grinding</b> tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and <b>grinding</b> capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, the two {{brothers}} joined with their younger brother Stephen to buy Acadia Plantation near Thibodaux. Within two years, they had established the first steam mill in Louisiana {{to be used for}} <b>grinding</b> sugar cane. The plantation became known as a model estate, but on February 12, 1831, they sold it and 65slaves for $90,000. With their profits, James and Rezin bought a plantation in Arkansas.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the <b>grind</b> percentage over mechanical properties, obtained by mold injection of various articles in the automotive industry, made of polyamide 6. 6. The specimens were made with the following composition: 100 % new material, new material 80 % + <b>grind</b> 20 %, new material 60 % + <b>grind</b> 40 %, new material 40 % + <b>grind</b> 60 %, new material 20 % + <b>grind</b> 80 % and <b>grind</b> 100 %. Mechanical properties were carried out using the methods of determining the tensile properties and determining the Izod impact properties. It was found that shock resistances decrease with increasing of <b>grind</b> percentage and tensile strength increases with increasing of <b>grind</b> percentage...|$|R

5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as <b>grinding,</b> honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (<b>grinding</b> of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E
5|$|Most lead ores {{contain a}} low {{percentage}} of lead (rich ores have a typical content of 3–8%) {{which must be}} concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium separation, <b>grinding,</b> froth flotation, and drying. The resulting concentrate, which has a lead content of 30–80% by mass (regularly 50–60%), is then turned into (impure) lead metal.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} {{broaching}} {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first applications used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form <b>grinding</b> and broaching machines.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, <b>grinding,</b> and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in <b>grinding</b> and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E

5|$|A large deer park, {{owned by}} the Crown, was {{established}} around the castle to provide hunting grounds. The castle was carefully positioned next to the park, which was overlooked by the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside the castle.
