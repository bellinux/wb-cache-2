After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

5|$|In the 12th and 13th centuries, Europe {{produced}} {{economic growth}} and <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> methods of production.

5|$|<b>Innovations</b> <b>in</b> Ottawa {{morphology}} {{contribute to}} differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes and word stems; {{the loss of}} final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes; a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating doubt; and a distinctive form for the verbal suffix indicating plurality on intransitive verbs with grammatically inanimate subjects.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a pervasive pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> pronunciation, in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E

For the relationship between self-efficacy and <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> IT, r[*]=[*] 0.363. For the relationship between hope and <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> IT, r[*]=[*] 0.414. For the relationship between optimism and <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> IT, r[*]=[*] 0.386. For the relationship between resilience and <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> IT, r[*]=[*] 0.432. Therefore, all of the relations are significant at the Alpha level of 0.05.

5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion picture with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades passed before sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. <b>Innovations</b> <b>in</b> sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E
5|$|A {{year into}} development, Activision {{proposed}} that Black Lotus be made {{part of an}} existing franchise and highlighted similarities to the True Crime series; both games were set in open worlds with plots centred on an undercover cop in a criminal organization. Sales of previous True Crime games had been disappointing, but Activision felt the <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> Black Lotus could revitalize the franchise and make the game successful in its own right. Activision attached the game to the series and revealed {{it to the public}} as True Crime: Hong Kong in November 2009. They delayed the game until 2010 to allow further refinement. During this period Hollywood action editor Tony Ciccone was hired to consult on the game's visual identity and animations.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> emergency medicine.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter a {{long period}} of {{disregard}} and underestimation, the issue of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services is now being taken seriously in economic theory, as well as in public policy.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a reinterpretation of the literature on <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services in the light of public services. Building on the interpretative framework of assimilation, demarcation, inversion and integration perspectives often used to analyze <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> market services, we review how the major studies conducted during two decades of research on <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services explicitly address or can be extrapolated to address <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> public services.

We propose a reclassification of the literature on <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services according to whether it has been mainly assimilated or differentiated with respect to the more traditional consideration of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing sector. We also review the integrative (or synthesizing) contributions, and suggest a taxonomy for the modes of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services, based on the Lancasterian characteristics-based approach to product definition.

5|$|Before 1914, Lenin's {{views were}} largely in {{accordance}} with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, {{including those of the}} Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> Marxist thought.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this began to change. Early <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

40|$|A well-functioning {{service sector}} {{is a key}} to the overall {{economic}} performance of any country and to the welfare of its citizens, but the role of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services has been underappreciated for a long time. In the common view the service sector is perceived as less innovative compared to the manufacturing sector and, therefore, characterized as being of a lower level of technological development. Indeed, the service sector accounts for much less technological innovation because for its organisational and mar-keting innovations are of greater importance for this sector. The aim of the paper is to discuss the character of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services, to identify the determinants and difficulties of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> services as well as <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> tourism. It is much more difficult to analyse <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> tourism and the types of innovation applied. It has been shown that the level of <b>innovation</b> <b>in</b> tourism is underestimated. ...|$|R
5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E

One of its <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out with active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, average {{temperatures}} began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting {{the extent of}} arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster.

5|$|Looking Glass' {{products}} were praised for <b>innovations</b> <b>in</b> video game technology and design. Several of their successes, such as Flight Unlimited and , sold {{over half a}} million copies each. Poor sales of their final two self-published games— (1996) and British Open Championship Golf (1997)—left the company in financial turmoil, however. This, combined with multiple failed business deals, including a temporary merger with Intermetrics to become Intermetrics Entertainment Software from 1997–99, led the company to close on May 24, 2000 and cancel several projects in development. Its final project, Jane's Attack Squadron, was completed by Mad Doc Software and released by Xicat Interactive in 2002. In total, Looking Glass Studios released 12original games in its 10years of activity, alongside several ports and other spin-offs.|$|E
