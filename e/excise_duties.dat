40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco {{products}} in the Czech Republic since 1993 {{up to the present}} time, especially the development of rates and revenues. <b>Excise</b> <b>duty</b> is imposed on tobacco products in the Czech Republic and also in the other European Union countries. Harmonisation efforts in the European Union and also fiscal need of Czech Republic cause frequent changes in tobacco <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, which conduces not only to change of tax collection, but can also bring some other related effects. In the theoretical part I first characterize the tax theory with a detailed focus on <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products. Subsequently I define the meaning of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products, the principles and the mechanisms of the tax collection. In the practical part of the thesis I aim at analyse the evolution of the legal framework that affects <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products and significantly affects the thesis in other sections. Further, I analyse the relationship between the rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products and tax collection and find out that the higher rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> not always led to higher tax yields. Finally I assess the effectiveness of the increase of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> on tobacco products {{and its impact on the}} consumption of tobacco products, illegal market and the public budgets...|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{selective}} nature, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> {{is one of}} themost effective {{sources of}} the state budget revenues. A fundamental influence on the receipts from this source is exercised by: the kinds and number of articles recognized as excisable and the volume of their sales {{in the country and}} of their imports, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, the extent of granted allowances and exemptions, as well as the efficiency in collecting the revenues from this duty. The range of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> applicability is very large and covers a great number of articles, many of them of no significant fiscal importance. At the same time, the list of allowances and exemptions introduced both by acts of Parliament or by ordinances of government bodies is excessively extended. The bulk of revenues obtained from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> comes from taxation of alcoholic beverages, tobacco articles and fuels, while the source of greatest importance is the duty on domestic sales of goods that, in 1994 - 2001, provided on average 87. 7 % of the total <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> revenues. The taxation of imports played a much smaller role. The rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> burden are relatively high and since the start of their functioning have been many times modified. However, in recent years a trend towards stabilizing the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, and even towards reducing some of them, can be observed. Excessive <b>excise</b> rate <b>duties</b> led to deterioration in the condition of the spirits, wine and tobacco branches. Financial difficulties of some firms, especially those producing alcoholic beverages, led to accumulation of arrears in the discharge of their <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> liabilities and to remission of a part of their indebtedness on that score. The <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> is a flexible source of budget revenues and it is the Minister of Finance who plays the role of the main author of the state's policy in this area. He has broad powers in shaping the rates and introducing the allowances and exemptions and, consequently, in shaping the revenues from the <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> The excessive authority of the Minister of Finance and the use of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> as a source of additional revenue whenever the budget is in critical situation is often subject for criticism. ...|$|R
40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R

25|$|Another factor which {{continues}} to {{play a significant role}} in the sales of Proton cars is the National Automotive Policy (NAP), enforced by the Malaysian government in the interests of Proton, Perodua, Naza and foreign brands with manufacturing plants in Malaysia. Under the NAP, imported vehicles are subjected to varying degrees of import and <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> depending on the vehicle's origin of manufacture and engine displacement, with excise duty imposed at 60 to 105 percent being the highest component in the duty structure. Vehicles imported from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, such as Thailand and Indonesia, are subject to the least import duties, whereas those from Europe suffer the worst. However, imported hybrid vehicles and cars purchased in duty-free Langkawi are exempted from the import and <b>excise</b> <b>duties.</b> The NAP ensures the survival of Proton and other Malaysian-made vehicles under a biased playing field in the Malaysian market. Nonetheless, the import duties of the NAP have been progressively revised and reduced in line with the eventual liberation of the market, but <b>excise</b> <b>duties,</b> the larger component of tariffs, continues to be high and opaquely applied, with non-tariff barriers effectively reducing the rate for Malaysian made vehicles. In March 2013, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Malaysia) announced that vehicles manufactured in Australia and Japan will face a gradual reduction of import duties in stages to zero by 2016. Proton however responded positively to the announcement, citing their recent positive developments such as the 5-star ANCAP safety recognition of the Proton Prevé as part of its commitment to progress.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The thesis {{analyses}} {{effects of}} <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> increase, effective from 1 st January 2010. The thesis concentrates on spirits, {{beer and wine}} market. Based on the Czech Statistical Bureau study of spirits market, all the significant declines of consumption took place whenever Czech government raised rates of <b>excise</b> <b>duty.</b> In comparison with selected European countries, the Czech nominal rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> of spirits is rather average. Our <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> of beer {{is one of the}} lowest rates in Europe. When correlating GDP, unemployment rate and alcohol consumption in Czech Republic, the thesis does not prove declines in GDP cause higher alcohol consumption nor rising unemployment results in higher alcohol consumption. However, results of correlation analysis are distorted by a short period on which data are available for the Czech Republic. Data available from both Board of Customs and Ministry of Finance proved that expectation of higher national tax revenue after rise of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rate has been incorrect. The national tax revenue in 2010 was by almost 1 billion CZK lower than the government expected...|$|R
25|$|An {{excise duty}} is an {{indirect}} tax imposed upon goods {{during the process}} of their manufacture, production or distribution, and is usually proportionate to their quantity or value. <b>Excise</b> <b>duties</b> were first introduced into England in the year 1643, as part of a scheme of revenue and taxation devised by parliamentarian John Pym and approved by the Long Parliament. These duties consisted of charges on beer, ale, cider, cherry wine and tobacco, to which list were afterwards added paper, soap, candles, malt, hops, and sweets. The basic principle of <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> was that they were taxes on the production, manufacture or distribution of articles which could not be taxed through the customs house, and revenue derived from that source is called excise revenue proper. The fundamental conception of the term is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles (a customs duty).|$|E

From 1920-1937, most roads in the United Kingdom were funded from the Road Fund using taxes raised from fuel duty and Vehicle Excise Duty. Since 1937, roads have been funded from general taxation with all motoring duties, including VAT, being paid directly to the Treasury.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{continued}} to deteriorate during 1663 and early 1664. Charles faced {{the same problem}} {{that his father had}} faced: financial arrangements that kept hm short of money. Parliament had voted him a seemingly generous grant from the customs and <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> for life, but his financial needs were greater, and he consequently constantly sought additional sources of income. The chartered companies, like the EIC and the RAC, looked promising in this respect, but their profitability depended on a rather predatory method of doing business that brought them in conflict with (especially) their Dutch competitors, the VOC and the WIC. The EIC was no match for the VOC, but the WIC was in its turn weaker than the RAC. The latter company managed in 1664 to conquer most of the trading posts of the WIC in West Africa, while in the same year an English expedition, outfitted by the Duke of York, Charles' brother, captured the WIC colony of New Netherland. These acts of war happened in peacetime. The English were confident that the Dutch, because of their supposed internal divisions, would not react forcefully. Again this was a miscalculation. De Witt ordered Vice-Admiral De Ruyter, who was at the time cruising in the Mediterranean, to retake the WIC forts (even though the WIC was supposed to handle its own affairs; in a way by involving the Dutch navy, De Witt was therefore raising the stakes in the conflict).|$|E
25|$|The Peace of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559 {{concluded}} {{the war with}} France, leaving Spain at a considerable advantage. However, the government was in enormous debt and declared bankruptcy that year. Most of the government's revenues came from taxes and <b>excise</b> <b>duties,</b> not imported silver and other goods. The Ottoman Empire had long menaced {{the fringes of the}} Habsburg dominions in Austria and northwest Africa, and in response Ferdinand and Isabella had sent expeditions to North Africa, capturing Melilla in 1497 and Oran in 1509. Charles had preferred to combat the Ottomans through a considerably more maritime strategy, hampering Ottoman landings on the Venetian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only in response to raids on the eastern coast of Spain did Charles personally lead attacks against holdings in North Africa (1545). In 1560, the Ottomans battled the Spanish navy off the coast of Tunisia, but in 1565 Ottoman troops landing on the strategically vital island of Malta, defended by the Knights of St. John, were defeated. The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by Selim the Sot emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the Ottoman homelands. In 1571, a mixed naval expedition of Spanish, Venetian, and papal ships led by Charles' illegitimate son Don John of Austria annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, in the largest naval battle fought in European waters since Actium in 31 BC. The fleet included Miguel de Cervantes, future author of the historic Spanish novel Don Quixote. The victory curbed the Ottoman naval threat against European territory, particularly in the western Mediterranean, and the loss of experienced sailors was to be a major handicap in facing Christian fleets. Yet the Turks succeeded in rebuilding their navy in a year, using it handily to consolidate Ottoman dominance over most of the Mediterranean's African coast and eastern islands. Philip lacked the resources to fight both the Netherlands and the Ottoman Empire at the same time, and the stalemate in the Mediterranean continued until Spain agreed to a truce in 1580.|$|E
