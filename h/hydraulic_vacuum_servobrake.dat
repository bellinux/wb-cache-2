5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a [...] ZMZ-24D engine, an {{evolution}} of the ZMZ-21A. Retaining the basic OHV configuration, it now ran on 92 RON gasoline (while the ZMZ 24-01 could use commonly available 76 octane, and the 24-07 could use liquid propane). The cylinder block was die cast, instead of the slower coquille for the 21A. The engine featured a twin-choke carburettor, with a higher compression ratio, producing [...] at 4500 rpm and an even more impressive [...] of torque at 2200-2400 RPM. Transmission was now fully synchronised four on floor layout. The brakes were improved, with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vacuum</b> servo unit (a licence-built Girling PowerStop), {{as well as an}} independent parking brake (rather than transmission brake of the GAZ-21). At the same time, certain features were retained for their proven reliability, like the kingpin front suspension and recirculating ball steering.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Diffusion bonding {{has been}} widely used within microlamination {{architectures}} for the fabrication of Micro Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS). MECS are microsystems {{with the ability to}} process bulk amounts of fluid within highly-parallel microchannel arrays capable of accelerated heat and mass transfer. Thus far, diffusion bonding of microchannel arrays is commonly done in a vacuum hot press system. The use of the hot press greatly restricts the production rate due to vacuum pump-down time and heating-up and cooling-down periods. Furthermore, larger substrates are gaining interest in the system design of MECS devices and it is not apparent that uniaxial pressing within a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>vacuum</b> hot press will provide the bonding pressure uniformity necessary for large substrate bonding. This thesis presents a novel fabrication approach for the high-volume thermal bonding of large substrate MECS devices with the use of controlled thermal expansion. A large substrate thermal bonding clamp based on the principle of differential thermal expansion was developed with focus on controlling the bonding pressure magnitude, timing, sensitivity and uniformity...|$|R

50|$|The CCKW had {{a ladder}} frame chassis with three driven beam axles, the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. There were two wheelbases, the short Model 352 {{and the long}} Model 353. The short, 145 in (Measurements are from the centerline of the front axle to the centerline of rear bogie) was used with a short cargo bed as an artillery prime mover for 75mm and 105mm howitzers. All other models used the long 164 in wheelbase. Tires were 7.50-20, brakes were <b>hydraulic</b> with <b>vacuum</b> assist.|$|R
5000|$|In {{passenger}} cars, {{the most}} common use of hydraulic power has been the steering system. Convertible tops may be raised and lowered using hydraulics. Windshield wipers were sometimes hydraulically driven, although this use mostly ceased after the late 1960s. On vehicles {{with little or no}} engine <b>vacuum,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> systems are generally adopted in place of vacuum systems.|$|R
5000|$|The G506 had {{a ladder}} frame with two live beam axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs.

There were three {{wheelbase}}s, 125 in extra short wheelbase used only on the G7128 Bomb servicer, 145 in short wheelbase, and the 175 in long wheelbase. All models had <b>hydraulic</b> brakes with <b>vacuum</b> boost, 7.50-20” tires and dual rear tires.|$|R
50|$|During the {{holographic}} mastering {{process for}} large format rainbow transmission holograms {{the strip of}} holographic film that becomes the H1 hologram master must be positioned {{in front of the}} subject (3D model) {{in such a way that}} it is bathed in diffused laser light, but importantly, must be held rigidly and firmly flat against a sheet of glass. Typically, elaborate <b>hydraulic</b> or <b>vacuum</b> systems have been employed to compress holographic film during the exposure process. However this function was achieved at Australian Holographics by the construction of what was referred to as 'the camera'. In fact the camera was a very long and narrow glass box, approximately 2.2 metres long, about 12 cm high and about 6 cm deep. Inside this 'camera' was a loose piece of glass slightly shorter than the length of the camera, but around the same height.|$|R
25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>vacuum</b> pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|R
50|$|Suspension was {{as on the}} Primula. At {{the front}} it {{consisted}} of A-arms and an upper transverse leaf spring, which doubled both as upper link and an anti-roll bar, {{as well as providing}} the attachment point for double-acting hydraulic dampers; at the rear there was a beam axle on longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs, plus double-acting hydraulic dampers.Steering was by means of a rack and pinion mechanism positioned beneath the transverse leaf spring and behind the engine.The braking system comprised four disk brakes, front-rear split <b>hydraulic</b> circuits, a <b>vacuum</b> servo and proportioning valve on the rear axle.|$|R

40|$|Metal-oxygen cells exhibit highest {{theoretical}} energy densities. State-of-the-art metal-oxygen cells mainly {{suffer from}} severe cyclic aging and low Coulombic efficiency. One {{of the major}} challenges {{is the development of}} suitable electrolytes and electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction and gas evolution reactions. One of the major limiting factors on performance and round-trip efficiency is the catalyst used. Today´s metal-air batteries still suffer from high charge- and discharge overpotentials caused by insufficient catalytic activity of the used electrode active mass. The major goal is to reduce overpotentials by using bifunctional catalysts catalyzing both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and to improve the porous electrode structure increasing the electrochemical active surface using different electrode production techniques like <b>hydraulic</b> hot pressing, <b>vacuum</b> plasma spraying or reactive rolling and mixing (RMR) technique...|$|R
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or <b>hydraulic</b> pressure or <b>vacuum</b> into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the impact of}} the use of mechanised equipment on physical load and workers' health among road workers and floor layers by comparing the traditional manual work method with frequently occurring scenarios of use of this new equipment. Continuous direct measurements of postures were linked to real-time observations of tasks and external forces applied during manual materials handling. A self-administered questionnaire on musculoskeletal complaints was used. The introduction of a <b>hydraulic</b> clamp or <b>vacuum</b> lift to assist roadmakers while laying a brick-paved road reduced the team's work time in a kneeling/squatting position with 43 - 52 % and frequency of lifting loads of 5 - 15 kg and above 15 kg with 46 - 59 % and 84 - 88 %, respectively. The introduction of a mixing machine with a pump system during pouring of sand-cement floors reduced the frequency of lifting loads with 66 % for 5 - 15 kg and 15 % for over 15 kg, but had no discernable effect oil awkward back postures. The use of a silo/truck with automated pump system also reduced the frequency of lifting with 32 % and 38 %, respectively, but increased the duration in awkward back postures with 13 %, primarily due to the hodman partly working as floor layer. Floor layers and hodmen using the mechanical equipment reported a lower prevalence of low back pain in the past 6 months and also less associated sick leave. The introduction of new mechanised equipment resulted in changes in physical load per task within jobs, changes in task distribution within jobs, and changes in work. organisation and jobs within a team. The judgement of experts on the impact of new devices on physical load should be corroborated in field studies on the average exposure to physical load per work day and per tea...|$|R

A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.Power operated handbrakes are fitted to heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These usually are spring applied, with air pressure being used to hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking brake cylinders to release the parking brake, or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking brake being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system is that if a vehicle requires towing and can not provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking brake to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{properties}} of liquid {{must be taken}} into consideration in the engineering design of hydraulic machines and hydro devices when {{there is a possibility that}} in their operation an absolute pressure in the liquid drops below atmospheric one, and for a certain time the liquid is in depression state. Cold boiling, which occurs at a comparatively low temperature under a reduced absolute pressure within or on the surface of the liquid is regarded as hydrostatic cavitation if the liquid is stationary or as hydrodynamic cavitation, if the liquid falls into conditions when in the flow cross-section there is a sharply increasing dynamic pressure and a dropping absolute pressure. In accordance with the theory of cavitation, the first phase of cavitation occurs when the absolute pressure of the degassed liquid drops to the saturated vapour pressure, and the air dissolved in the liquid, leaving the intermolecular space, is converted into micro-bubbles of combined air and becomes a generator of cavitation “nuclei”. A quantitative estimate of the minimum allowable absolute pressure in a real, fully or partially degassed liquid at which a hydrostatic cavitation occurs is of practical interest. Since the pressure of saturated vapour of a liquid is, to a certain extent, related to the forces of intermolecular interaction, it is necessary to have information on the cavitation {{properties of}} technical solutions, including air solution in a liquid, as a solute may weaken intermolecular bonds and affect the pressure value of the saturated solvent vapour. In the experiment to carry out vacuum degassing of liquids was used a <b>hydraulic</b> air driven <b>vacuum</b> pump. The paper presents hydrostatic and hydrodynamic degassing liquid processes used in the experiment. The experimental studies of the cavitation properties of technical liquids (sea and distilled water, saturated NaCl solution, and pure glycerol and as a 49 / 51 % solution in water, mineral oil and jet fuel) enabled us to have an quantitative estimate of the absolute pressure in the allowable technical liquids and solutions, its dependence on the saturated vapour pressure, as well as to define the influence of a degree of the hydrodynamic degassing of liquid and the amount of its solute on the liquid tensile strength. The paper gives a comparative assessment of cavitation properties of liquids. When studying the cavitation properties of solutions it has been found that a level of the allowable absolute pressure in a solution exceeds that of in the solvent. It is suggested that the dissolved solid, liquid or gaseous substances weaken the intermolecular bonds of the solvent and increase the pressure of its saturated vapour. </p...|$|R
