The latest revision, described in this Master’s Thesis, incorporates new capabilities like EMI shielding, an inert <b>gas</b> <b>purge</b> <b>system,</b> and an electrical interface to the CubeSats after they are integrated into the P-POD. Additionally, some mass reduction modifications are made to the P-POD, while its overall strength is increased. The P-POD inert <b>gas</b> <b>purge</b> <b>system</b> successfully flew, on a previous revision P-POD.

40|$|Electrocatalysts play an {{important}} role in sustainable energy-related fields. As these catalysts still require improvement on activity and stability, a lot of effort is invested in developing new materials. Due to the enormous parameter space spanned by material composition and experimental conditions, there is a great demand for high-throughput screening of the material performance. To address this issue, a scanning flow cell (SFC) has been developed and is utilized for catalyst research for the first time. The adaptation of a homemade LabVIEW program to the SFC setup enables fully automated, computer-controlled high-throughput measurements. A <b>gas</b> <b>purging</b> <b>system</b> is introduced to saturate the electrolyte with gases in a timeframe comparable to typical rotating disk electrode (RDE) systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of the setup, the oxygen reduction reaction on polycrystalline platinum is investigated as a sample system. The cyclic voltammograms are consistent with those expected from investigations in conventional electrochemical cells. Repetitive measurements show high reproducibility. Considering the potential of the system toward improvements and extensions, the SFC will be a valuable screening tool for electrocatalyst research...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{systems in}} high {{precision}} equipment become increasingly more complex {{due to the}} raising number of optical mounts used for mounting and positioning of optical components. Additional, the installation of electronics and inert <b>gas</b> <b>purging</b> <b>systems</b> to protect the optics against the abrasive optical beam extends the amount of components in the optical system, while keeping the surface area of the overall optical system as small as possible. Recent developments in optical systems lead to innovations of optical flexure mounts towards a more compact, accessible and user-specific system with integrated functionality at consistently high standards of optical stability. Additive manufacturing, commonly named 3 D printing, offers new possibilities of designing optical flexure mounts, since the layer-wise manufacturing approach allows the production of highly complex parts compared to traditional processes. Topology optimization is a mathematical design tool that can help to design these increasingly complex parts, such as the optical mount, by computing optimal material distributions for a given objective with a determined set of constraints and boundary conditions. The thesis objective is bilateral: The first research objective investigates the design of compliant mechanisms for industrial optical mounts by means of additive manufacturing. The second research objective investigates the suitability of Topology Optimization for designing compliant mechanisms for optical mounts. This research is providing insights into the working principles of optical mounts and compliant mechanisms as well as topology optimization and additive manufacturing. The present case studies demonstrate and evaluate topology optimization design techniques for compliant structures and mechanisms. Further, the use of additive manufacturing for compliant optical mounts mechanisms designs is evaluated.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the present work is to perform a heat balance study for type-I waste tank {{to assess the impact}} of using submersible mixer pumps during waste removal.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityThree topics {{related to}} the {{degradation}} of hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds in percarbonate systems were studied. The first chapter provides a literature review and {{a brief description of}} the three treatment systems used in the present research: catalyzed hydrogen peroxide propagations (CHP), sodium percarbonate (PC), and base-activated persulfate (BAP) treatment systems. The second chapter presents a study of the degradation of contaminants by superoxide generated in PC systems, and further investigates the relationship between type of halogen and degree of halogenation in superoxide degradation rate for halogenated contaminants. Superoxide was responsible for the degradation of chlorinated compounds; and the rate of degradation by superoxide increased with greater degree of halogenation. Moreover, compounds with higher electronegativity were degraded more rapidly than those with lower electronegativity. Degradation of hydrophobic contaminants sorbed onto silica gel in PC, CHP, and BAP treatments are discussed in chapter three. The results demonstrate that chloroalkene and chloroalkane compounds were effectively degraded in CHP and PC systems, but not in BAP systems. Organochlorine insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls were degraded in the CHP and BAP systems, but not in the PC systems. The hydrophobic herbicides diuron, bentazon, 2, 4 -D, and 2, 4, 5 -T were degraded in CHP, BAP, and PC treatment systems with a degradation rate above the desorption rate of <b>gas</b> <b>purge</b> (GP) <b>systems.</b> However, atrazine was degraded only in CHP and BAP systems, indicating that superoxide does not react with atrazine. The fourth chapter covers changes in superoxide reactivity in aqueous systems with the addition of solids and minerals. The effects of 14 minerals and solids on the reactivity of superoxide in PC systems were investigated. The results showed increased superoxide reactivity in aqueous superoxide systems with the addition of solids or minerals due to increased surface area in the system. The results indicate that increased surface area—not the nature of the solid or mineral—is responsible for the increase in superoxide reactivity in aqueous PC systems. The linear relationship between the rate constants for HCA degradation and the actual solid or mineral surface areas demonstrates that providing surfaces in superoxide systems enhances its reactivity.

50|$|VSA {{differs from}} {{cryogenic}} distillation techniques of gas separation {{as well as}} pressure swing adsorption (PSA) techniques because it operates at near-ambient temperatures and pressures. VSA may actually be best described as {{a subset of the}} larger category of PSA. It differs primarily from PSA in that PSA typically vents to atmospheric pressures, and uses a pressurized gas feed into the separation process. VSA typically draws the gas through the separation process with a vacuum. For oxygen and nitrogen VSA systems, the vacuum is typically generated by a blower. Hybrid VPSA systems also exist. VPSA systems apply pressurized gas to the separation process and also apply a vacuum to the <b>purge</b> <b>gas.</b> VPSA <b>systems,</b> like one of the portable oxygen concentrators, are among the most efficient systems, measured on customary industry indices, such as recovery (product gas out/product gas in), productivity (product gas out/mass of sieve material). Generally, higher recovery leads to a smaller compressor, blower, or other compressed gas or vacuum source and lower power consumption. Higher productivity leads to smaller sieve beds. The consumer will most likely consider indices which have a more directly measurable difference in the overall system, like the amount of product gas divided by the system weight and size, the system initial and maintenance costs, the system power consumption or other operational costs, and reliability.|$|R
