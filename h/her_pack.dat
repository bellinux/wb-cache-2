5|$|For a while, Red and <b>her</b> <b>pack</b> are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} {{is upset}} by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs.

500|$|The {{earliest}} Norse people venerated {{the horse}} {{as a symbol}} of fertility, and white horses were slaughtered at sacrificial feasts and ceremonies. When these settlers arrived in Iceland, they brought their beliefs, and their horses, with them. Horses played a significant part in Norse mythology, and several horses played major roles in the Norse myths, among them the eight-footed pacer named Sleipnir, owned by Odin, chief of the Norse gods. Skalm, a mare who is the first Icelandic horse known by name, appeared in the Book of Settlements from the 12th century. According to the book, a chieftain named Seal-Thorir founded a settlement at the place where Skalm stopped and lay down with <b>her</b> <b>pack.</b> Horses also play key roles in the Icelandic sagas Hrafnkel's Saga, Njal's Saga and Grettir's Saga. Although written in the 13th century, these three sagas are set {{as far back as the}} 9th century. This early literature has an influence today, with many riding clubs and horse herds in modern Iceland still bearing the [...]|$|E
500|$|When not on {{the front}} lines, Reckless packed other items for the platoon, and was {{particularly}} useful for stringing telephone wire. Carrying reels of wire on <b>her</b> <b>pack</b> that were played out as she walked, she could string as much wire as twelve men on foot. She became the first horse in the Marine Corps known to have participated in an amphibious landing when the 5th moved from Camp Casey to Inchon, planning to participate in amphibious landings hundreds of miles south of Inchon. The commanding officer of the transport halted loading operations {{when he saw the}} platoon on the dock with Reckless. He refused to take her on board his clean ship, which had won an award for being the cleanest ship in the previous two years. She was allowed on board after the Marines produced the loading plan, approved by him, which specifically listed Reckless and her equipment. Once the ship was underway, she became sick, making a mess on the ship's decks during {{the first part of the}} voyage. She could not be disembarked due to a storm, but soon became accustomed to the motion of the ship at sea and had no more problems. The 1st Marine Division was moved to a rest area soon after the move, and while there some platoon members posed with Reckless and a sign challenging the Thoroughbred Native Dancer to a race. They called their race the [...] "Paddy Derby", the field [...] "Upsan Downs", and the conditions differed from a typical horse race: 1.5 miles over paddies and hills, carrying 192 pounds of ammunition, and no riders. The Marines never received a reply; Native Dancer came in second in the Kentucky Derby, and went on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.|$|E
