50|$|In the {{mechanical}} example, {{to declare that}} dx is not a <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> because it ignores the dynamic relationship between displacement, force, and energy is not correct. Displacement, as a concept in geometry, {{does not require the}} concepts of energy and force for its definition, and so one might expect that entropy may not require the concepts of energy and temperature for its definition. The situation is not that simple, however. In classical thermodynamics, which is the study of thermodynamics from a purely empirical, or measurement point of view, thermodynamic entropy can only be measured by considering energy and temperature. Clausius' statement dS= δQ/T, or, equivalently, when all other effective displacements are zero, dS=dU/T, {{is the only way to}} actually measure thermodynamic entropy. It is only with the introduction of statistical mechanics, the viewpoint that a thermodynamic system consists of a collection of particles and which explains classical thermodynamics in terms of probability distributions, that the entropy can be considered separately from temperature and energy. This is expressed in Boltzmann's famous entropy formula S=kB ln(W). Here kB is Boltzmann's constant, and W is the number of equally probable microstates which yield a particular thermodynamic state, or macrostate.|$|E
40|$|The Lucas & Kanade (LK) {{algorithm}} is {{the method of}} choice for efficient dense image and object alignment. The approach is efficient as it attempts to model the connection between appearance and <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> through a linear relationship that assumes independence across pixel coordinates. A drawback of the approach, however, is its generative nature. Specifically, its performance is tightly coupled with how well the linear model can synthesize appearance from <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement,</b> even though the alignment task itself {{is associated with the}} inverse problem. In this paper, we present a new approach, referred to as the Conditional LK algorithm, which: (i) directly learns linear models that predict <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> as a function of appearance, and (ii) employs a novel strategy for ensuring that the generative pixel independence assumption can still be taken advantage of. We demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance to classical generative forms of the LK algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate its comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods such as the Supervised Descent Method with substantially less training examples, as well as the unique ability to "swap" geometric warp functions without having to retrain from scratch. Finally, from a theoretical perspective, our approach hints at possible redundancies that exist in current state-of-the-art methods for alignment that could be leveraged in vision systems of the future.

In addition, relations of pump flow property {{and its influence}} factors are also inves-tigated. During that, only the pumps with transverse contact ratios of not less than one are discussed. First, using the involute property, an analytic representation for flowrates is deduced, by which displacements and fluctuation coefficients of helical gear pumps can be calculated accurately and efficiently. Then, by incorporating several design considerations, optimization problems formaximum <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> are formulated and solved integrally by an opti-mization code, Multifunctional Optimization System Tool, with which various types of design variables including real, integer, and discrete can be simultaneously dealt with. Finally, the desired pumps with optimal displacement can be obtained. The proposed approach facilitates the design optimization of helical gear pumps. Moreover, influences of design parameters on the displacement and flow characteristics of the optimal pumps by assigning individual param-eters are investigated. The result also concludes that the pump with a larger module, larger face width, or smaller tooth number has bigger displacement but may cause more severe flowrate fluctuation...|$|E

Adaptive wing technology, and shape morphing airfoils in particular, represents a promising way forward. The aerodynamic {{performance of the}} morphing profiles {{is an important issue}} affecting the overall aerodynamic performance of an adaptive wing. A new concept of active flow, the Active Camber concept has been investigated. The actuator is integrated into the aerofoil and aerofoil morphing is realized via camber deformation. In order to identify the most aerodynamically efficient designs, an optimisation study has been performed using high resolution methods in conjunction with a two equation eddy viscosity model. Several different types of previously proposed compressible filters, including monotone upstream-centered schemes for conservation laws (MUSCL) and weighted essential non-oscillatory (WENO) filters, are incorporated and investigated in the present research. The newly developed CFD solver is validated and the effect that high resolution methods have on turbulent flow simulations is highlighted. The outermost goal is the development of a robust high resolution CFD method that will efficiently and accurately simulate various phenomena, such as shock/boundary layer interaction, flow separation and turbulence and thus provide the numerical framework for analysis and aerodynamic aerofoil design. With respect to the latter a multi-objective integrated design system (MOBID) has been developed that incorporates the CFD solver and a state-of-the-art heuristic optimisation algorithm, along with an efficient parametrization technique and a fast and robust method of propagating <b>geometric</b> <b>displacements.</b> The methodologies in the MOBID system resulted in the identification of the design vectors that revealed aerodynamic performance gains over the datum aerofoil design.

We {{investigate}} the long-term {{evolution of the}} Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF) in the spectrum of the binary X-ray pulsar Her X- 1 and present evidence of a true long-term decrease in the centroid energy Ecyc of the cyclotron line in the pulse phase averaged spectra from 1996 to 2012. Methods. Our results are based on repeated observations of Her X- 1 by those X-ray observatories capable of measuring clearly beyond the cyclotron line energy of about 40 keV. Results. The historical evolution of the pulse phase averaged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized by an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about 40 keV between 1990 and 1994, and an apparent decay thereafter. Much of this decay, however, {{was found to be}} due to an artifact, namely a correlation between Ecyc and the X-ray luminosity Lx discovered in 2007. In observations after 2006, however, we now find a statistically significant true decrease in the cyclotron line energy. At the same time, the dependence of Ecyc on X-ray luminosity is still valid with an increase of about 5 % in energy for a factor of two increase in luminosity. A decrease in Ecyc by 4. 2 keV over the 16 years from 1996 to 2012 can either be modeled by a linear decay, or by a slow decay until 2006 followed by a more abrupt decrease thereafter. Conclusions. We speculate that the physical reason could be connected to a <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> of the cyclotron resonant scattering region in the polar field or to a true physical change in the magnetic field configuration at the polar cap by the continued accretion.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{formulation}} {{of a class}} of elements that are immune to mesh distortion effects is proposed here. The simple three-noded bar element with an offset of the internal node from the element center is employed here to demonstrate the method and the principles on which it is founded upon. Using the function space approach, the modified formulation is shown here to be superior to the conventional isoparametric version of the element since it satisfies the completeness requirement as the metric formulation, {{and yet it is}} in agreement with the best-fit paradigm in both the metric and the parametric domains. Furthermore, the element error is limited to only those that are permissible by the classical projection theorem of strains and stresses. Unlike its conventional counterpart, the modified element is thus not prone to any errors from mesh distortion. The element formulation is symmetric and thus satisfies the requirement of the conservative nature of problems associated with all self-adjoint differential operators.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many {{problems}} in structural mechanics are solved using the {{finite element method}} (FEM), wherein {{a model for a}} mechanical system is constructed by discretising the structure into a finite set of structural elements, connected at nodes, leading to a system of equations to be solved. In the case of linearised <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> equations and linear elastic material behaviour, a system of linear equations is obtained. There may be uncertainty in {{some or all of the}} physical model parameters, caused for example by measurement and fabrication imprecision, round-off errors, and various other kinds of inexact knowledge. Intervals can be used to model such parameters when their values are known to lie within certain bounds. In this case, we obtain a system of equations involving interval parameters. However, a naive solution of this system, using interval arithmetic, will typically lead to a solution with result intervals that are hopelessly wide. Previous work has dealt with models where the parameters for uncertain material values (e. g. the Young’s modulus and elements’ cross-sectional areas) are intervals. However a mechanical frame or truss structure will typically be constructed so that the node positions, before loading, are only known to a tolerance of several millimetres. In this work, we therefore consider not only uncertain material parameters but also uncertain node locations and correspondingly uncertain element lengths, as well as uncertain loading forces. In our approach, firstly guaranteed starting interval enclosures for the node displacements which are relatively wide are computed. These solution intervals are then iteratively tightenend by performing a monotonicity analysis of all the parameters coupled with a solver for interval systems of linear equations. In this way it is possible to provide tight guaranteed enclosures for the node displacements of the model. A simple truss model is presented by way of illustration. ...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigated}} the physical behaviour {{and the effectiveness}} of a nonlinear dynamic vibration absorber (NDVA), which was designed to possess hardening stiffness characteristics. Two types of external force excitation were considered (harmonic and random input) applied to a primary system, with attached NDVA, and the response compared. For harmonic excitation, the governing equations of motion for the entire vibrating system and the expressions for the solution were derived using the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM). Mathematical expressions for the frequency response curves of the structural system were subsequently determined. The bifurcation and stability characteristics of the identified periodic steady state solutions were obtained. The effect of the NDVA parameters (e. g., nonlinear stiffness, damping ratio, mass ratio and frequency ratio) on the vibration reduction were studied. From the numerical results it was observed that the NDVA had a much wider effective vibration reduction bandwidth compared to a linear absorber. The frequency response curve of the NDVA had the effect of moving the second resonance peak to a higher frequency away from the tuned frequency, so that the device is robust to mistuning. For random excitation, time and frequency domain techniques were used and the effect of the nonlinear absorber parameters on the vibration reduction have been determined. The experimental validation, for the nonlinear absorber considered, involved a nonlinear hardening spring supporting a mass which was designed and attached to a cantilever beam excited by a shaker. The absorber nonlinearity that occurred was due to large <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> and in-plane effects. The cantilever beam, at low frequencies, acted as a linear single degree-of-freedom system. The nonlinear absorber was designed to behave as a hardening Duffing oscillator.

It does not only show a large number of observable features, but has repeatedly been the first object for which fundamental discoveries were made: it was the first to show a super-orbital modulation, the first to reveal a cyclotron line in its spectrum and the first in which systematic variations of the cyclotron line energy were detected, namely variations with pulse phase (by ∼ 25 %) and a positive correlation with X-ray luminosity (∼ 5 % increase for a factor of two increase in luminosity). Now we have found another 'first': a long-term decrease of the pulse phase averaged cyclotron line energy E_ cyc by ∼ 5 keV in 20 years. At the time of the discovery of the cyclotron line in 1976, its energy was ∼ 35 keV, remeasured around a similar energy by various instruments until 1990. Between 1990 and 1994 a jump upwards beyond 41 keV occurred, we are now back at ∼ 37 keV With respect to the physical cause of the discovered effect, we suggest it to be connected to a <b>geometric</b> <b>displacement</b> of the cyclotron resonant scattering region in the polar magnetic field or due to to a true physical change in the field configuration at the accretion mound or column by the continued accretion. The variation with time might be due to a non-perfect equilibrium between the rate at which material is accreted and the rate at which material is lost at the base of the accretion mound, allowing for a variation of the configuration of the accretion mound (height, total mass, field distribution). We do believe that we see the signature of a local change in the field configuration, rather than a decay of the global magnetic field, since the observed timescale of a few decades is very short.

It was found that the free dynamics excited by a blast load and the forced dynamics excited by a harmonic force posses POD modes which are localized in space and time. The processing of the simulated dynamics by the Time Discrete Proper Transform forms a means to study the nonlinear coupled dynamics of sandwich structures in the context of nonlinear normal modes of vibration and reduced order models.

40|$|Springback in {{sheet metal}} product makes {{difficulties}} in die design because small strain causes large displacement. Especially for the sheet metal product having small <b>geometric</b> constraints, springback <b>displacement</b> may become severe. After {{first stage of}} stamping of outer case of washing machine, {{a large amount of}} springback is observed. The stamping depth of the outer case is small while stamping area is very large compared to the stamping depth, and therefore, there exists small geometric constraints in the formed part. Also, a compressive instability during the elastic recovery takes place and this instability enlarged the elastic recovery and dimensional error. In this paper, the compressive instability during the elastic recovery is analyzed using bifurcation theory. The final deformed shape after springback is obtained by bifurcating the solution path from primary to secondary. The deformed shapes obtained by the finite element analysis are in good agreement with the experimental data. The bifurcation behavior and the springback displacement for different forming depth are investigated...|$|R
