40|$|Using {{the density}} of food left in a patch after {{foraging}} - i. e. the giving-up density (GUD) - as a behavioural indicator, short-term foraging studies on birds in the dry and wet <b>fringing</b> <b>forests</b> and savanna habitats of the Amurum Forest Reserve, Laminga, Nigeria, were used to evaluate whether widespread food abundance will affect their behaviour in these apparently-different habitats. The effect of the dry season on feeding activity {{and the effects of}} temperature within, and between, days were also investigated. Results showed that GUDs were highest in dry <b>fringing</b> <b>forests,</b> intermediate in wet <b>fringing</b> <b>forests,</b> and lowest in savanna. This difference may have been {{as a result of a}} difference in food abundance between habitats. The availability of water in the wet <b>fringing</b> <b>forests</b> may have affected the feeding behaviour of the birds in the wet gully habitat compared with those of the dry gully. The behaviour of birds in response to time of day was affected by temperature, as there was no difference between GUDs in open and covered habitats in the mornings at lower temperatures, but lower GUDs were recorded in cover (at higher temperatures) in the afternoon when birds may - due to thermoregulatory costs - retreat to cover more often. However, temperature had no effect on GUDs over season. A reduction in GUDs towards the end of the dry season, as food resources deplete, gives further credence to the observation that food abundance affects behaviour...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores and {{analyzes}} {{the demand for}} and supply of forests in and near urban areas from a social perspective. Specific focus is directed towards recreational qualities of forests located just outside urban borders, that is, urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forests.</b> To this end, the thesis is based on four empirical research papers. Papers I and II explore the demand component, while Paper III focuses on the supply component. Finally, Paper IV integrates issues of both demand and supply. In Paper I, a survey directed {{to the general public}} in urban areas is used to address differences between public attitudes to the forest in general and to the urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forest</b> more specifically. Paper II builds upon interviews with municipal planners with responsibility for green space issues in nine Swedish cities. In Paper III, spatial forest data is analyzed in a GIS to examine how urbanization and population developments influence the supply of urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forests</b> over time. Spatial analysis is further used in Paper IV to quantify forest attractiveness and accessibility in a single measure of urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forest</b> demand and supply. In Paper I it is shown that urban residents associate the urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forest</b> with a variety of design characteristics, as people’s opinions do not solely concern social qualities but also ecological and functional qualities. It is concluded that the overall influence of socioeconomic and demographic attributes is modest in comparison to the basic values and beliefs people hold about life, the environment, and the forest in general. In Paper II it is demonstrated that it is imperative for municipalities to own forest, since this allows them to secure sufficient provisions of recreational forests for future residents and from urban land developments. However, as private citizens do generally not take part of local planning and management decision-making there is an obvious risk for decisions biased towards the interests of social organizations, with specific activity and structural demands that do not necessarily reflect the interests of the general public. From Paper III it is evident that urbanization and population developments do not necessarily lead to a reduced supply of urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forests</b> over time; forest management practices are equally important to consider with regards to people’s opportunities to visit attractive forests for recreation. Finally, in Paper IV it is shown that more attractive forests are generally less accessible to urban residents, regardless of mode of transportation, and that the accessibility to urban <b>fringe</b> <b>forests</b> is generally lower in more deprived neighborhoods. The research for Paper I of this thesis was conducted in collaboration with Future Forests, a multidisciplinary research program, and its sponsors: the Strategic Foundation for Environmental Research (Mistra), the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Umeå University, the Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk), and the Forestry Industry in Sweden.

40|$|The {{colonization}} o f the Siyai Lagoon on {{the north}} coast of Natal by Phragmites australis was studied by means of  air photo interpretation. It was possible to locate and estimate P. australis areas for 1957 (0, 74 ha), 1965 (1, 65 ha), 1969 (1, 93 ha) and 1976 (2, 94 ha). Phragmites australis first inhabited {{the shores of the}} middle section o f the lagoon followed by rapid expansion in the lower section. The upper section was colonized only at its lower end by expansion from the middle section. It is suggested that P. australis was unsuccessful in this section because of competition by the  Hibiscus tiliaceus—Barringtonia racemosa  Lagoon <b>Fringe</b> <b>Forest.</b> This same community is shading out  P. australis in some places. The notable increase in the rate of advance of land and littoral vegetation into the Siyai Lagoon was caused by sugar farming activities leading to erosion and sedimentation in the lagoon.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy in AgricultureThis thesis {{examines}} the key requirements of and influences on recruitment of Melaleuca quinquenervia in a narrow, lake-fringe forest habitat within the Myall Lakes National Park. Seed production and dispersal, germination and seedling establishment were investigated {{and a model}} was developed for Paperbark recruitment within the <b>fringing</b> <b>forest.</b> Seed viability, seed fall, seed longevity and seedling emergence were examined as was optimum temperature for germination. The requirement for light for germination of M. quinquenervia is demonstrated conclusively in this study. M. quinquenervia seeds are shown {{to have a high}} tolerance to salinity levels up to 10 deci Siemens per metre (dS/m). Casuarina leachate was found to have a slight inhibitory effect on Paperbark seedling germination. During January and February of 2006 and 2007, drought conditions, causing all-time low lake levels, provided the optimum conditions for germination. Germination appears to be seasonal, but highly dependent on the provision of a moist, preferably non-saline microsite. Survival and mortality of several natural seedling populations at lake foreshore sites was monitored. The seedling establishment stage was shown to be the most limiting process in the recruitment cycle and previous suggestions of recruitment being episodic are confirmed. Hence, protection of the foreshore areas where young seedlings are most likely to establish is paramount {{in order to protect the}} integrity of the <b>fringing</b> <b>forest,</b> as this study has shown that the chance of seedlings surviving to become juvenile trees is very slim...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{investigated}} the carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry of mangrove island of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (Twin Cays, Belize). The C:N:P of abiotic and biotic components of this oligotrophic ecosystem was measured and served to build networks of nutrient flows for three distinct mangrove forest zones (tall seaward <b>fringing</b> <b>forest,</b> inland dwarf forests and a transitional zone). Between forest zones, the stoichiometry of primary producers, heterotrophs and abiotic components did not change significantly, {{but there was a}} significant difference in C:N:P, and C, N, and P biomass, between the functional groups mangrove trees, other primary producers, heterotrophs, and abiotic components. C:N:P decreased with increasing trophic level. Nutrient recycling in the food webs was highest for P, and high transfer efficiencies between trophic levels of P and N also indicated an overall shortage of these nutrients when compared to C. Heterotrophs were sometimes, but not always, limited by the same nutrient as the primary producers. Mangrove trees and the primary tree consumers were P limited, whereas the invertebrates consuming leaf litter and detritus were N limited. Most compartments were limited by P or N (not by C), and the relative depletion rate of food sources was fastest for P. P transfers thus constituted a bottleneck of nutrient transfer on Twin Cays. This is the first comprehensive ecosystem study of nutrient transfers in a mangrove ecosystem, illustrating some mechanisms (e. g. recycling rates, transfer efficiencies) which oligotrophic systems use in order to build up biomass and food webs spanning various trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|Using the Web of Science® {{database}} (Institute of Science Information – ISI, Philadelphia, PA, USA) we analysed pre- (1972 - 2004) and post-tsunami (2005) {{clues about}} the protective buffer offered by mangroves and other coastal vegetation in peer-reviewed ISI-rated scientific literature. Apart from providing a literature review on the above topic, this study reveals that papers dealing with or suggesting the protective function of mangroves have been well represented in scientific literature since the 1970 s. However, high-profile journals and their associated media engine tremendously failed {{to pick up the}} importance of the scientific findings related to mangrove ecosystems. Apparently, the tsunami strike of 26 December 2004 raised the status of mangrove research overnight, and to a level that was of immediate interest to researchers in a broad range of other disciplines, and thus fit for high-profile journals. However, the database showed a highly significant inverse relationship between the impact factor of the journals in which posttsunami mangrove papers were published and the pre-tsunami mangrove expertise of the authors. While suggesting that the above trend is worrying, we present a research framework that should receive much more attention in research in the future by many journals of low and high impact factor. In the light of mangroves and protection against a wide range of water-related impacts - not only tsunamis but also cyclones, sea-level rise, daily tidal action and heavy El-Niño rains - it should be investigated which type of mangrove formation or coast-geomorphological settings has which effect. Root type, vegetation structure and species composition are categories with a lot of variation within, and may be considered in parallel with for instance a lagoon setting with a <b>fringing</b> <b>forest.</b> Detangling the effect of such complexity under various water-related impacts will allow fully exploring and understanding the power of mangroves and other coastal vegetation as protective buffers. These priorities in fundamental research should be considered in parallel with research and policy measures on the conservation and restoration of mangroves, taking into account links with the socio-economic reality of local communities...|$|E
40|$|There are few {{detailed}} carbon (C) {{budgets of}} mangrove forests, yet {{these are important}} for understanding C sequestration in mangrove forests, how they support the productivity of the coast and their vulnerability to environmental change. Here, we develop C budgets for mangroves on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We consider seaward <b>fringing</b> <b>forests</b> and interior scrub forests that have been fertilized with phosphorus (P), which severely limits growth of trees in the scrub forests. We found that respiration of the aboveground biomass accounted for 60 %– 80 % of the fixed C and that respiration of the canopy and aboveground roots were important components of respiration. Soil respiration accounted for only 7 %– 11 % of total gross primary production (GPP) while burial of C in soils was ~ 4 % of GPP. Respiration by roots can account {{for the majority of}} soil respiration in <b>fringing</b> <b>forests,</b> while microbial processes may account 80 % of respiration in scrub forests. Fertilization of scrub forests with P enhanced GPP but the proportion of C buried declined to ~ 2 % of GPP. Net ecosystem production was 17 %– 27 % of GPP similar to that reported for other mangrove forests. Carbon isotope signatures of adjacent seagrass suggest that dissolved C from mangroves is exported into the adjacent ecosystems. Our data indicate that C budgets can vary among mangrove forest types and with nutrient enrichment and that low productivity mangroves provide a disproportionate share of exported C...|$|R

40|$|Mangrove {{forests in}} {{subtropical}} areas are highly heterogeneous environments, influenced by diverse physical structures and tidal flushing regimes. An {{important component of}} tidal water is the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), as it affects aquatic organisms such as fish (directly: respiration and behaviour) and immature mosquitoes (directly: trigger for egg-hatch; indirectly: fish predation of larvae). Changes in DO may be important over relatively small time scales such as minutes and days, but, at such scales it has received little investigation. The {{aim of this study}} was to address this knowledge gap, monitoring DO at small time intervals (1 min) over tidal flooding events (hours – days) in two contrasting subtropical mangrove systems. These represented a range of mangrove tidal hydrology: a well-connected fringing mangrove forest in south-east Queensland and a more complex mangrove basin forest in northern New South Wales with impeded tidal connections. The results indicated that patterns of DO varied diurnally and by mangrove system. In the <b>fringing</b> <b>forest,</b> where the substrate was exposed before and after flooding, the highest mean DO concentration was during the day, followed by evening, with pre-dawn the lowest (6. 8, 6. 5 and 6. 1 mg/l, respectively). DO patterns differed by tide stage and time of day with falling DO especially during late evening and pre-dawn as tides ebbed. In the mangrove basin forest the pattern was reversed, but also depended on the distance the tide had travelled across the basin. Before tidal incursion, standing water in the basin was anoxic (DO 0 mg/l). As tidal water flooded into the systems there was a greater increase in DO closer to the tide source than further away, with a DO concentration of 7. 6 mg/l compared to 5. 4 mg/l. The observations were interpreted in the light of processes and potential impacts on aquatic organisms (fish and immature mosquitoes). The most significant observation was that in the mangrove basin DO concentrations suitable for aquatic organisms (such as fish) persisted for only a relatively small period during the tide (∼ 1 h), with hypoxic conditions for the remainder. This combination of conditions is favourable to immature mosquitoes...|$|E

40|$|Wetlands, {{including}} mangroves, perform diverse functions, {{besides the}} production {{of goods and services}} on an ecosystem and landscape scale. The combination of functions, goods and ecological services has a fundamental importance for society. The study of physiographic types is intended to help in dealing with and understanding the function of a complex system. Complex systems are those that share four attributes: diversity of constituents, interdependence between parts, connectedness and adaptation. This study was carried out in the Cananéia region, located in the southern coast of the São Paulo State (25 °S), Brazil. Data from the 1980 ’s to 2009 on the structural development of mangrove forests of two physiographic types, fringe and basin, were analyzed to discern patterns of spatial and structural organization. The <b>fringe</b> <b>forests</b> studied in the region presented a predominance of Rhizophora mangle and high structural development due to the high inundation frequency in depositionally stable sites. <b>Fringe</b> <b>forests,</b> located in progradation areas with low tidal energy, were dominated by Laguncularia racemosa with low structural development. The basin forests are dominated by R. mangle or L. racemosa, presenting reduced structural development in function of the lower inundation frequency, a predominantly sandy substrate and low salinity. But some basin forests dominated by Avicennia schaueriana were better developed reflecting the growth characteristic of this species.
