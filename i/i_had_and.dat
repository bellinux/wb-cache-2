500|$|The {{murder of}} Lennon on 8 December 1980 {{disturbed}} Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about stalkers. It {{was also a}} deep personal loss, although unlike McCartney and Starr, Harrison had little contact with Lennon {{in the years before}} his death. Following the murder, Harrison commented: [...] "After all we went through together <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>and</b> still have great love and respect for John Lennon.

A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> acting was something I was good at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{released}} his fourth full-length solo album Shadows Collide with People on February 24, 2004. This featured guest appearances {{from some of}} his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea. In June 2004, {{he announced that he}} would be releasing six records over six months: The Will to Death, Ataxia's Automatic Writing, DC EP, Inside of Emptiness, A Sphere in the Heart of Silence and Curtains. With the release of Curtains Frusciante debuted his only music video of 2004, for the track [...] "The Past Recedes". He wanted to produce these records quickly and inexpensively on analog tape, avoiding modern studio and computer-assisted recording processes. Frusciante noted, [...] "These six records were recorded in a period of six months after coming home from touring with the Chili Peppers for one-and-a-half years. I made {{a list of all the}} songs <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>and</b> they totaled about seventy. My objective was to record as many songs as I could during the break that I had. In the midst of doing that, I was writing some of my best songs, so some of these albums have as many new songs as old songs. It was definitely the most productive time of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{free agent}} in 2002, Lofton signed a one-year, $1.025 million {{contract}} with the Chicago White Sox. [...] "I looked at the different opportunities that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>and</b> this was a team that won 83 games last year while they were banged up. Cleveland lost four good players from last year's team, and that's {{going to be hard}} to replace. This was an easy decision", Lofton said on signing with the White Sox. White Sox general manager Kenny Williams had stated when Lofton was healthy, like he was during the second half of the 2001 season, Chicago had obtained one of the best leadoff hitters in the game. When the White Sox were paired against the Indians in April during a three-game series at Chicago, the Indians were on a 10-game winning streak and at 111, had the best record in the majors. The White Sox ended the streak and for the series, Lofton was 6-for-14 with six runs scored. [...] "You can't say enough about him, his effort, his intensity. He's been simply amazing", said White Sox manager Jerry Manuel. Lofton appeared in 93 games with the White Sox and hit [...]259 with 42 RBIs and 22 stolen bases. On July 28 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants of the National League for minor leaguers Ryan Meaux and Félix Díaz.|$|E
500|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as [...] "very focused," [...] and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive [...] "group" [...] atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return {{the next day to}} sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that [...] "I made sure to send maybe the strangest stuff <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> it just so happened that Kanye was excited by that." [...] Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated:It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, it would all be edited by Kanye himself. In a weird way, he kind of produced it. Not only did he select it, but he stylized it. Determined to [...] "undermine the commercial," [...] several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no [...] "bass wobbles" [...] reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as [...] "very raw" [...] by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was [...] "rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually." [...] While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as [...] "the fastest record we ever made." [...] In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the [...] "final product," [...] (only later to be changed) describing the album as [...] "dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|While at Idaho, Lightfoot also {{excelled in}} the classroom, {{which was the}} {{opposite}} of what had been occurring at the high school and junior college levels. He did not miss a single class in his three years and graduated on time. Years later, he had this retrospective on the change: [...] "I was not dumb, just lazy and spoiled.

2500|$|For Frith's early {{unstructured}} music, as with Henry Kaiser on With Friends Like These, and {{his early}} table-top guitar solo performances, {{he used a}} homemade six- and eight-string double-neck guitar created by a friend, Charles Fletcher.

[...] The possibilities offered by homemade instruments prompted Frith to start creating his own guitars, basically slabs of wood on which he mounted a pickup, a bridge, and strings stretched over metal screws. [...] "The basic design of the instrument is supposed to be as rudimentary and flexible as possible," [...] Frith said, [...] "so I can use an electric drill to bore holes into the body of it to achieve certain sounds ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>and</b> she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E

The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy.

2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
