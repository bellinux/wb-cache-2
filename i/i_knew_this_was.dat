500|$|In a 1991 {{interview}} with Izvestia, Major Genadi Osipovich, pilot of the Su-15 interceptor that shot the 747 down, spoke about his recollections {{of the events}} leading up to the shootdown. Contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, he recalled telling ground controllers that there were [...] "blinking lights". He continued, saying that [...] "I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use." [...] He furthermore did not provide {{a detailed description of the}} aircraft to the ground controllers: [...] "I did not tell the ground that it was a Boeing-type plane; they did not ask me." ...|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] was {{originally}} intended for inclusion on Rihanna's fifth studio album Loud, the song's accompanying daytime video {{was used as}} part of Doritos Late Night Campaign. Jonas Åkerlund directed both daytime and nighttime versions for the song, which featured different colors and styles. The daytime video leaked onto the Internet on September 17, 2010, before it was given an official release. In a press statement given by Rihanna, the singer revealed how she was exited to work with Doritos on the project, saying: [...] "I'm really excited about 'Who's That Chick?' and {{wanted to find a}} fresh and unique way to share it with my fans... When I saw how cool the augmented reality performance Doritos created was, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> it. This was the way I wanted to make 'Who's That Chick?' available to the world, and I can't wait to see how my fans get engaged in this innovative experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 12, Tallchief {{began to}} work with Bronislava Nijinska, a renowned {{choreographer}} who had recently opened her own studio in Los Angeles, and David Lichine, a choreographer and former dancer. Nijinska [...] "was a personification of what ballet was all about", Tallchief recalled. [...] "I looked at her, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> what I wanted to do." [...] Nijinska imparted {{a strong sense of}} discipline and the belief that being a ballerina was a full-time task. [...] "We didn't concentrate only {{for an hour and a}} half a day", Tallchief recalled. [...] "We lived it". It was under Nijinska that Tallchief decided ballet was what she wanted to devote her life to. [...] "Before Nijinska, I liked ballet but believed that I was destined to become a concert pianist", she recalled. [...] "Now my goal was different." [...] Nijinska saw Tallchief was serious and began devoting great attention to her.|$|E
2500|$|From 2006–2009, Morpurgo, Lee Hall and Revel Guest {{worked on}} a {{proposed}} film version of War Horse, which Morpurgo and Hall would write and Guest produce. Lack of finances meant {{that it was an}} informal arrangement, with the film rights not formally sold by Morpurgo to Guest's production company and no one being paid for the work they undertook. In 2009, film producer Kathleen Kennedy saw the critically acclaimed production of War Horse in London's West End with her husband, fellow producer Frank Marshall and their two daughters. They were very impressed by the story and Marshall has recalled how he was amazed that no one had already bought the film rights to the book. Steven Spielberg was told about War Horse by several people, including Kennedy, who was his colleague at Amblin Entertainment. After discussions with Revel Guest, it was announced on 16 December 2009 that DreamWorks had acquired the film rights to the book, with Spielberg stating: [...] "From the moment I read Michael Morpurgo's novel War Horse, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a film I wanted DreamWorks to make ... Its heart and its message provide a story that can be felt in every country." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location {{at or near the}} San Dimas Canyon. In {{reference to}} the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for [...] "over a day" [...] before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that [...] "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> coming, so I agreed." [...] Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.|$|E

60|$|The second hut {{was easier}} to erect, for I built it against the first, and only three walls were required. But it was work, hard work, all of it. Maud and I worked from dawn till dark, to the limit of our strength, so that when night came we crawled stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like sleep exhaustion. And yet Maud {{declared}} {{that she had never}} felt better or stronger in her life. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> true of myself, but hers was such a lily strength that I feared she would break down. Often and often, her last-reserve force gone, I have seen her stretched flat on her back on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating. And then she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever. Where she obtained this strength was the marvel to me.|$|E

60|$|Lucy and I then {{talked of}} the {{approaching}} ceremony. Each {{of us was}} grave and sorrowful, but neither indulged in any outward signs of grief. We knew the last sad offices were to be performed, and had braced ourselves to the discharge of this melancholy duty. It was not customary with the females of purely New York families {{of the class of}} the Hardinges, to be present at the performance of the funeral rites; but Lucy told me she intended to be in the little church, and to share in as much of the religious offices as were performed within the building. In a population as mixed as ours has become, {{it is not easy to}} say what is and what is not now a national or state usage, on such an occasion; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> going farther than was usual for one of Lucy's habits and opinions, and I expressed a little surprise at her determination.|$|E
60|$|Carson Haldane, {{owner of}} Bonaventure, which he {{occasionally}} visited, {{sat at the}} head of the table, a clean-shaven, dark-haired man of little more than middle age, whose slightly ascetic appearance concealed a very genial disposition. He was a man of mark, a daring speculator in mills and lands and mines, and supposed to be singularly successful. Why he bought Bonaventure ranch, or what he meant to do with it, nobody seemed to know; but he acted in accordance with the customs of the place in which he found himself, and because the distinctions of caste and wealth are not greatly recognized on the prairie there was nothing incongruous in his present company. Sergeant Mackay--lean, bronzed, and saturnine when the humor seized him--now bent his grizzled head with keen gray eyes that twinkled as he chatted to the fresh-faced girl in the simple dress beside him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> Lucille Haldane, but had hardly glanced at her. Cotton had evidently forgotten that he was a police trooper, and, when he could, broke in with some boyish jest or English story told in a different idiom from that which he generally adopted. He seemed unconscious that he was recklessly betraying himself.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, {{just after}} day-break, we were {{awakened by a}} good deal of {{tramping}} about on deck, over our heads, and we turned out, sharp, to see what the matter was. Rectus wanted me to wait, after we were dressed, until he could get out his map and calculate where we were, but I couldn't stop for such nonsense, for I knew that his kind of navigation didn't amount to much, and so we scrambled up on deck. The ship was pitching and tossing worse than she had done yet. We had been practising the [...] "sea-leg" [...] business the day before, and managed to walk along pretty well; but this morning our sea-legs didn't work at all, and we couldn't take a step without hanging on to something. When we got on deck, we found that the first officer, or mate,--his name was Randall,--with three or four sailors, was throwing the lead to see how deep the water was. We hung on to a couple of stays and watched them. It was a rousing big lead, a foot long, and the line ran out over a pulley at the stern. A sailor took the lead a good way forward before he threw it, so as to give it a chance {{to get to the bottom}} before the steamer passed over it and began to tow it. When they pulled it in, we were surprised to see that it took three men to do it. Then Mr. Randall scooped out a piece of tallow that was in a hollow in the bottom of the lead, and took it to show to the captain, whose room was on deck. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> one way they had of finding out where they were, for they examined the sand or mud on the tallow, and so knew what sort of a bottom they were going over; and all the different kinds of bottom were marked out on their charts.|$|E

Why, {{it comes back to}} me like waves of fire and burns me. I remember every word, every act, every gesture. I lifted my head slowly, Jack, and looked over the screen at him. In the twilight, I saw him there--the man I called my father--holding the bottle to your face, that wicked bottle of chloroform, with his revolver in one hand, and a calm smile like a fiend's playing hatefully and cruelly round that grave-looking mouth of his. I never saw any man look so ghastly in my life. I was rooted to the spot with awe and terror. I dared hardly cry out or move. Yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> murder. He would kill you! He would kill you! He was trying to poison you before my very eyes. Oh, heaven, how I hated him! He was no father of mine. He had never been my father. And he was murdering the man I loved best in the world. For I loved you better than life, Jack! Oh, the strain of it was terrible! I see it all now. I live it all over again. With one wild bound I leapt forward, and, hardly knowing what I did, I pressed the button, turned off the current from the battery, and rushed wildly upon him. I suppose the knob I pressed not only released you, but set the photographic machine at work automatically. But I didn't know it then. At any rate, I remember now, in the seconds that followed, flash came fast after flash. There was a sudden illumination. The room was lighter than day. It grew alternately bright as noon and then dark as pitch again by contrast. And {{by the light of the}} flashes, I saw you, half-dazed with the chloroform, standing helpless there.|$|E
6000|$|The {{better part}} of one's life {{consists}} of his friendships; and, of them, mine with Mr. Edwards {{was one of the}} most cherished. I have not been false to it. At a word I could have had the office any time before the department was committed to Mr. Butterfield, at least Mr. Ewing and the President say as much. That word I forbore to speak, partly for other reasons, but chiefly for Mr. Edwards' sake, losing the office (that he might gain it) I was always for; but to lose his friendship, by the effort for him, would oppress me very much, were I not sustained by the utmost consciousness of rectitude. I first determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, on the 2nd of June; and I did so then upon being informed by a telegraphic despatch that the question was narrowed down to Mr. B and myself, and that the Cabinet had postponed the appointment three weeks, for my benefit. Not doubting that Mr. Edwards was wholly out of the question I, nevertheless, would not then have become an applicant had I supposed he would thereby be brought to suspect me of treachery to him. Two or three days afterwards a conversation with Levi Davis convinced me Mr. Edwards was dissatisfied; but I was then too far in to get out. His own letter, written on the 25th of April, after I had fully informed him of all that had passed, up to within a few days of that time, gave assurance I had that entire confidence from him which I felt my uniform and strong friendship for him entitled me to. Among other things it says, [...] "Whatever course your judgment may dictate as proper to be pursued, shall never be excepted to by me." [...] I also had had a letter from Washington, saying Chambers, of the Republic, had brought a rumor then, that Mr. E had declined in my favor, which rumor I judged came from Mr. E himself, as I had not then breathed of his letter to any living creature. In saying I had never, before the 2nd of June, determined to be an applicant, unconditionally, I mean to admit that, before then, I had said substantially I would take the office rather than it should be lost to the State, or given to one in the State whom the Whigs did not want; but I aver that in every instance in which I spoke of myself, I intended to keep, and now believe I did keep, Mr. E above myself. Mr. Edwards' first suspicion was that I had allowed Baker to overreach me, as his friend, in behalf of Don Morrison. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a mistake; and the result has proved it. I understand his view now is, that if I had gone to open war with Baker I could have ridden him down, and had the thing all my own way. I believe no such thing. With Baker and some strong man from the Military tract & elsewhere for Morrison, and we and some strong man from the Wabash & elsewhere for Mr. E, it was not possible for either to succeed. I believed this in March, and I know it now. The only thing which gave either any chance was the very thing Baker & I proposed,--an adjustment with themselves.|$|E
