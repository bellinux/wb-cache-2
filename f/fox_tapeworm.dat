40|$|Austria {{is part of}} the {{classical}} area of central Europe to which classical alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is endemic. Annual incidences in Austria were 2. 4 and 2. 8 cases/ 100, 000 population during 1991 – 2000 and 2001 – 2010, respectively. Hence, the registration of 13 new AE patients in 2011 was unexpected.

40|$|Abstract. To date, only {{a single}} proven case of {{autochthonous}} human alveolar echinococcosis has been recorded in Minnesota in 1977. At that time, echinococcal lesions removed from the patient were experimentally inoculated into voles, and the parasite materials obtained from the voles were preserved as histopathologic specimens for 30 years. In this study, retrospective genetic analysis of larval Echinococcus multilocularis originating in the human case was per-formed using the histopathologic specimens. DNA was extracted from the hematoxylin and eosin–stained specimens, and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox 1) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Subse-quently, 20 small fragments (100 ∼ 216 bp) covering almost the entire sequences (97 %) of the cox 1 were successfully amplified, and the nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the E. multilocularis isolate from Minnesota was almost identical to an isolate from South Dakota rather than isolates from contiguous Alaska.

The excised mass showed multinodular, necrotic, and spongiform appearance with small irregular pseudocystic spaces. Microscopically, the mass was composed of chronic granulomatous inflammation with extensive coagulation necrosis and parasite-like structure, which was revealed as parasitic vesicles and laminated layer delineated by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. Clinical and histologic features were consistent with AE.

40|$|In humans, larvae of the <b>fox</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Echinococcus multilocularis {{typically}} infect {{the liver}} where metastasis, calcification and necrosis cause the zoonotic disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Treatment is difficult. Early detection greatly increases patient life expectancy but under-detection is a problem. Understanding the ecological conditions that elevate AE risk would help identify at-risk communities.

Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by the metacestode stage of the <b>fox</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Echinococcus multilocularis, is a rare zoonosis in Germany, mainly occurring in the south (1). The parasite predominantly develops in the liver of the human host, where the infiltrating growth can cause serious damage (2).

E. multilocularis infection is highly endemic among foxes in Germany, and studies indicate that the parasite’s geographic range has widened in recent years (5, 6). Growing fox populations in Europe, especially in urban zones, have drawn attention to a potential increased risk for humans (7 – 9). In 2001, AE reporting became mandatory in Germany (10).

However, these factors alone are insufficient to explain the heterogeneous distribution of the parasite in Europe. Here, we analysed the spatial interrelationship of E. multilocularis with the known distribution of seven vole species in Ticino, southern Switzerland. Among 404 necropsied foxes (1990 - 2006) and 79 fox faecal samples (2010 - 2012), E. multilocularis was consistently found {{in the north of}} the investigated area.

40|$|Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} (AE) {{in humans}} is a parasitic disease characterized by severe {{damage to the}} liver and occasionally other organs.

Conventionally, human AE is chemotherapeutically treated with mebendazole or albendazole. There is, however still the need for improved chemotherapeutical options.

Disadvantages of this methodological approach include risk of injury to organs during the inoculation and, most notably, a limitation in the macroscopic (visible) assessment of treatment efficacy. Thus, in order to monitor the efficacy of chemotherapeutical treatment, animals have to be euthanized and the parasite tissue dissected.

40|$|Cestodes {{are unable}} to {{synthesize}} de novo most of their own membrane lipids, including cholesterol, and have to take them up from the host during an infection. The underlying molecular mechanisms are so far unknown. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel gene, Emabp, which is expressed by larval stages and adults of the <b>fox</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Echinococcus multilocularis. The encoded protein, EmABP, displays significant homologies to apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AI-BP) of mammalian origin and to metazoan YjeF_N domain proteins. Like mammalian AI-BP, EmABP carries an export-directing signal sequence which is absent in predicted AI-BP orthologs from the related flatworms Schistosoma japonicum and Schmidtea mediterranea. Using a specific antibody and immunoprecipitation techniques, we demonstrate that EmABP is secreted into the extraparasitic environment and into the hydatid fluid of in vitro-cultivated metacestode vesicles. Furthermore, we show that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a major constituent of cholesterol-transporting high-density lipoproteins, is present in hydatid fluid. By pulldown experiments, we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed, purified EmABP interacts with purified human apoA-I {{and is able to}} precipitate apoA-I from human serum. On the basis of these features and the suggested function of AI-BP in cholesterol transport in higher eukaryotes, we propose a role for EmABP in cholesterol and lipid uptake mechanisms of larval E. multilocularis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There are two foci of {{alveolar}} echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis in Japan. The first {{focus is on}} Rebun Island where AE patients were found from 1937, {{and the second is}} in eastern Hokkaido where patients have been found since the 1960 s. The origin of the second focus is unknown. To further investigate AE in eastern Hokkaido, wild rodents (Muridae) were captured and examined for infection on Kunashiri Island, which is located 15 km off the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. Metacestodes of E. multilocularis were isolated from two of 31 voles, all of which were identified to be Clethrionomys rufocanus. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing data of recovered cestodes showed total identity with the cestode reported from Hokkaido. These results suggest that E. multilocularis may have been introduced to Hokkaido from Kunashiri Island during or after 1965. Alveolar echinococcosis (AE), 1 which is caused by inges-tion of eggs of the <b>fox</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Echinococcus multilocularis, is the most potentially lethal parasitic infection of the non-tropical areas in the northern hemisphere because of its ten-dency to invade and proliferate in the liver and the difficulty in treatment. 1 – 3 Known endemic areas in Far East Asia in-clude China 3 – 5 and Hokkaido, Japan. 6 However, there is n...|$|E
40|$|Human {{alveolar}} echinococcosis (AE) is a lethal parasitic infectious disease which {{may lead to}} liver failure if left untreated. It {{is caused by the}} larval stage of the <b>fox</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Echinococcus multilocularis and usually develops a substantial infiltrative occupation in solid organs. During the infection, T helper subsets are known to play crucial role in crosstalk between the parasite and human host. Th 9 cells, a new member of CD 4 + T cell family which is characterized by its specific cytokine IL- 9 and transcription factors PU. 1 and IRF- 4, have been known recently to have a critical role in allergic diseases, and cancers as well as the parasitic infection. To assess the potential role of Th 9 cells during the infection, the mRNA levels of IL- 9, PU. 1, and IRF- 4 both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in liver tissues were, respectively, detected by using real-time PCR. The plasma concentration levels of IL- 9 were detected by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Th 9 related cytokine IL- 9 and transcription factors PU. 1 and IRF- 4 mRNA levels elevated both in PBMCs, and in hepatic lesion and paralesion tissues in AE patients. This may facilitate the infiltrative growth of the parasite and its persistence in human host...|$|E
