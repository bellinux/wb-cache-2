Despite efforts by Vijayabahu I and Parakramabahu I in the 13th century to renovate and resurrect the temple, its gradual destruction in the course of time could not be averted, particularly after the final transfer of the capital from Polonnaruwa in the Rajarata, or King's Country, to an alternative location in 1215 as a result of repeated Maga invasions.|$|E

25|$|However, {{some critics}} did not review the film so positively. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan criticized Max’s overtly “snooty” {{personality}} as “too off-putting to tolerate” which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} citing an issue with the film’s shift in tone in the final act, stating “the air goes out of the movie” in regards to “stage-setting and character development”. He further wrote, “Anderson and Wilson are good offbeat filmmakers … But their film seems torn between conflicting possibilities: it’s structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, and <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> wish they’d allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows”.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E

500|$|... "The Middle," [...] {{the second}} single from the album, {{includes}} a guitar solo that, according to Adkins, [...] "is {{a tribute to}} Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices". Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my head and I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> didn’t bring it to the band because I was thinking to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing.

500|$|Mérens {{horses were}} {{sold at the}} Tarascon-sur-Ariege horse fair, and were popular with merchants from the large cities. The breed was {{sometimes}} called [...] "Tarasconnais", after the town, and was famous for the high quality of its legs {{and the ability to}} survive on poor food. It was used to breed mules, and the Pyrenees mule was derived from a cross between Catalan donkeys and horses of the Breton, Mérens and other breeds. Before World War <b>I,</b> <b>almost</b> 1,000 Pyrenees mules were born annually in the Ariege department. The first breed show was organized in 1872. By the end of the 19th century, horses from the Pyrenees were known for their use as light cavalry. They were praised for their agility, sure-footedness, robust constitutions, and endurance, a result of their semi-feral existence in the Pyrenees mountains.|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't even know what colour my last opera is, and <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> don't remember it."

500|$|On February 14, 1951, Robinson and LaMotta met for {{the sixth}} time. The fight would become known as The St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Robinson won the undisputed World Middleweight title with a 13th round {{technical}} knockout. Robinson outboxed LaMotta for the first 10 rounds, then unleashed a series of savage combinations on LaMotta for three rounds, finally stopping the champion {{for the first time}} in their legendary six-bout series—and dealing LaMotta his first legitimate knockout loss in 95 professional bouts. LaMotta had lost by knockout to Billy Fox earlier in his career. However, that fight was later ruled to have been fixed and LaMotta was sanctioned for letting Fox win. That bout, and some of the other bouts in the six-fight Robinson-LaMotta rivalry, was depicted in the Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull. [...] "I fought Sugar Ray so often, <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> got diabetes", LaMotta later said. Robinson won five of his six bouts with LaMotta.|$|E
