25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a <b>facility,</b> <b>equipment</b> or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed at almost any time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E
500|$|Established in 1917 as {{a private}} corporation, the company began with a single product line of harvest straw hats. [...] By the late 1930s, the company had {{expanded}} into fiber pressed sun hats and leather harvest hats. [...] During World War II, International Hat developed and produced several models of military sun helmets, including a model with rudimentary ventilation. [...] After the war, the company became interested in plastic molding injection, moving increasingly away from pressed fiber. [...] In the 1950s, General Fibre Company, a subsidiary of International Hat, {{changed its name to}} General Moulding Company to reflect these production changes in basic materials. [...] By the 1960s, International Hat was mostly producing baseball caps, straw hats, earmuffs, plastic helmets, and plastic sun hats. [...] During this era of expansion, the company had a proclivity for building its factories in small rural cities, often becoming the largest employer and economic backbone of those communities. [...] On several occasions, International Hat donated land or <b>facility</b> <b>equipment</b> for the creation of municipal parks located adjacent to one of its factories, namely for the purpose of benefiting employees, their families, and the local community.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study seek {{to examine}} the impact of <b>facilities</b> and <b>equipment</b> as {{predicting}} effective health care delivery in selected state government hospitals in Oyo State. Four hypothese were formulated and tested at 0. 05 alpha level. A total of 1, 220 respondents were randomly selected for the study. The instruments for the study were a structured questionnaire on <b>facilities</b> and <b>equipment</b> as predictors of effective health care delivery service and checklist of items on Infrastructure and equipment. The results from the study indicated that <b>facilities,</b> <b>Equipment</b> and Adequacy of <b>facilities</b> and <b>Equipment</b> were statistically significant and predict effective health care delivery service while Availability of <b>facilities</b> and <b>equipment</b> was found not to be significant and could not predict effective health care delivery services. The implication from this finding shows that <b>facilities,</b> <b>equipment</b> and adequacy of <b>facilities</b> and <b>equipment</b> actually predicted effective health care delivery service while availability of <b>facilities</b> and <b>equipment</b> did not predict effective health care delivery services...|$|R

During 1975 and 1976, WCWM upgraded its studios and transmitter to stereophonic operation and increased its effective radiated power to 1,600 watts, according to former student John Keimig (class of 1978), who worked in the station's engineering department during that time. The whole process of procuring and installing <b>facility</b> <b>equipment</b> and submitting the necessary applications to the Federal Communications Commission was handled by student volunteers who then held leadership positions at the station. The college provided funding and administrative support. Programming in those years typically ran from 7:00 AM to 3:00 AM, with continuous operation when volunteer staff were available to fill the [...] "graveyard" [...] shift. The station's frequency changed from 89.1 MHz to 90.7 MHz before the 1985-86 academic year.|$|E
50|$|Beef {{and pork}} {{products}} sold at farmers' {{market in the}} US, like those of any other beef/pork product that are sold to the public, must originate from livestock slaughtered in a government (federal or state) inspected slaughterhouse. Since government inspected slaughterhouses purchase livestock for slaughter, many often have the facilities, equipment, and personnel to supply meat products to distributors/wholesalers. Like restaurants, such arrangements are popular with farmers’ market vendors because they allow them to avoid the overhead costs (<b>facility,</b> <b>equipment,</b> knowledge, maintenance, food safety inspections, etc.) associated with producing meat products that may be legally sold to the public. Resell vendors are in the majority at farmers’ markets while vendors that make and package their own meat products represent a very small percentage. Reselling allows vendors to minimize investment and overhead costs by purchasing their products from a commercial slaughterhouse and/or processing plant.|$|E

50|$|When Bombay {{meets the}} team, he realizes the {{children}} have no practice <b>facility,</b> <b>equipment</b> or ability to go with it. The team's first game with Bombay at the helm is against the Hawks, the team from the snooty suburb of Edina. Reilly is still head coach and remains bitter about Gordon's shortcoming in the game years earlier (even lamenting that they should take the runner-up banner down from that season despite having a wall full of first place banners from other years). District 5 gets outclassed and pummeled during the game due to Reilly demanding the Hawks run up the score; after the game, Bombay berates the team for not listening to him and the players challenge his authority. For the next game, Bombay tries to teach his team how to dive and get penalties. Meanwhile, Bombay discovers his old mentor and family friend Hans (Joss Ackland) who owns a nearby sporting goods store, was in attendance. While visiting him, Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game, and due to Reilly solely blaming Gordon for the loss. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion.|$|E
