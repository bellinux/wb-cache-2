40|$|The {{effect of}} {{conventional}} CR 39 and Fresnel prisms on {{high and low}} contrast letter acuity was studied. Visual acuity of the fully corrected better eyes of 15 subjects was measured with the high (90 %) and low (10 %) contrast logMAR letter charts, while they wore prisms of varying power. The results showed that when {{the power of the}} conventional CR 39 prism and the Fresnel prism reached 10 prism <b>dioptres</b> and 5 prism <b>dioptres,</b> respectively, significant reduction (1 tail t-test, p < 0. 05) of the high and low contrast acuity occurred.

50|$|In humans, {{the total}} optical {{power of the}} relaxed eye is {{approximately}} 60 dioptres. The cornea accounts for approximately two-thirds of this refractive power (about 40 dioptres) and the crystalline lens contributes the remaining one-third (about 20 dioptres).) In focusing, the ciliary muscle contracts to reduce the tension or stress transferred to the lens by the suspensory ligaments. This results in increased convexity of the lens which in turn increases the optical power of the eye. As humans age, the amplitude of accommodation reduces from approximately 15 to 20 dioptres in the very young, to about 10 dioptres at age 25, to around 1 <b>dioptre</b> at 50 and over.|$|E

It repeated for both eyes. Four-base-out is a distance method because suppression scotomas in micro-strabismus is usually small and by using a near target, the examiner might cause the image of the target to land outside of said suppression zone and any signs of micro-strabismus or monofixation might be masked.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} corneal astigmatism {{in patients}} {{under the age}} of 55 years with Graves' ophthalmopathy and to compare it to a control group. METHODS: Retrospective, nonrandomized comparative observational case series. A total of 109 patients with inactive Graves' ophthalmopathy and 109 age- and gender-matched control individuals without Graves' ophthalmopathy were examined with manual corneal keratometry. In the Graves' patients, 52 % had a CT scan available for review, and 41 % underwent orbital, strabismus, and/or eyelid surgery with a follow-up of keratometry over a mean period of 1. 7 years after surgery. RESULTS: For the <b>dioptres,</b> there was a statistically significant difference between the Graves' and the control eyes at 3 - 3. 25 <b>dioptres</b> in both eyes (t-test, right eyes, P= 0. 042; left eyes, P= 0. 041). For the meridians, the astigmatism was found to be greater at the meridians 95 - 100 degrees (t-test, P= 0. 044) and 105 degrees - 110 degrees (t-test, P= 0. 017) in the right eyes only. In 10 (9 %) Graves' patients, the astigmatism had caused newly acquired reduced visual acuity. Greater astigmatism in <b>dioptres</b> did not correlate with specific CT scan findings (chi(2) -test, df= 2, P= 0. 187). Following orbital, strabismus, and eyelid surgery, the <b>dioptres</b> and meridians of the astigmatism did not change in 56 (68 %) and 66 (81 %) eyes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Graves' ophthalmopathy may be associated with greater with-the-rule corneal astigmatism, which, overall, is not influenced by orbital, strabismus, or eyelid surgery. The astigmatism may possibly be caused by soft-tissue fibrosis in the superolateral orbital region. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} focus on near objects declines {{throughout}} life, from an accommodation of about 20 dioptres (ability to focus at 50 mm away) in a child, to 10 dioptres at age 25 (100 mm), and levels off at 0.5 to 1 <b>dioptre</b> at age 60 (ability to focus down to 1-2 meters only). The expected, maximum, and minimum amplitudes of accommodation in diopters (D) for a corrected patient of a given age can be estimated using Hofstetter's formulas: expected amplitude (D) = 18.5 - 0.3 × (age in years), maximum amplitude (D) = 25 - 0.4 × (age in years), minimum amplitude (D) = 15 - 0.25 × (age in years).|$|E

Thus an eye care professional, having determined that a myopic (nearsighted) person requires a basic correction of, say, −2 dioptres to restore normal distance vision, might then make a further prescription of 'add 1' for reading, to make up for lack of accommodation (ability to alter focus).
