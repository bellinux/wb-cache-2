I want to do that! When I become an author, I {{want to be able}} to do things in parentheses.' I liked the power of putting things in brackets." [...] Narnia also introduced him to literary awards, specifically the 1956 Carnegie Medal won by the concluding volume. When Gaiman won the 2010 Medal himself, the press reported him recalling, [...] "it had to be the most important literary award there ever was" [...] and observing, [...] "if you can make yourself aged seven happy, you're really doing well - it's like writing a letter to yourself aged seven."Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was another childhood favourite, and [...] "a favourite forever.

5000|$|According to band leader Bill Leeb {{there was}} no theme from which the album took form. [...] "Everyone just started doing stuff", {{he said in an}} {{interview}} with Auxiliary Magazine, emphasizing how the band was influenced by their surroundings, [...] "I don’t know if it’s just the times we live in or the stuff going on around us. Whether you read the internet or watch the news or whether you <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people. It just seems like it ended up being a theme of predominance, world issues." [...] Leeb cited travelling with the band as important inspiration, mentioning trips to Russia as example: [...] "Front Line has always liked iconic symbolism and going to countries like that really inspired me lyrically." [...] "It seemed like wherever we looked there was something for us to get into. We didn’t have to make up any stories or create anything that wasn’t already in front of us.", he concluded. Similarly, the album title arose from the band's perception of the outside world. Guitarist Jared Slingerland said in a conversation with The Rumpus, [...] "I mean, I.E.D., it's obvious what it is, but because it's still kind of a sensitive issue, Bill came up with the idea of 'electronic device.' There's obviously some overlap there." ...|$|E
