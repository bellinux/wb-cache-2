5|$|A {{prototype}} robot {{inspired by}} the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked <b>foreleg</b> to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the <b>foreleg</b> of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The <b>foreleg</b> ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|Under each <b>foreleg,</b> the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
50|$|Both sexes are morphologically similar. The male's and the female's forewing lengths {{range from}} 3.7 cm to 4.6 cm, with the mean length equaling 4.2 cm. The {{antennae}} lack scales. Although all danaids have {{two pairs of}} walking legs, the <b>forelegs,</b> the first pair located on the prothoracic segment of the abdomen, is stunted and of little use. The <b>forelegs</b> are more atrophied in the male than in the female. The female uses its short <b>forelegs</b> to scratch the surfaces of leaves to determine which ones are suitable hosts for its eggs. On both sexes, only the atrophied <b>forelegs</b> lack claws.|$|R
50|$|When female swallowtails {{decide which}} leaf to oviposit on, they {{frequently}} will drum their <b>forelegs</b> toward a leaf to identify it. Their <b>forelegs</b> have chemoreceptors {{located in the}} foretarsi that assess the chemical makeup of the leaf and use that information to decide if it is an acceptable spot. In general, females have shorter and denser sensilla on their <b>forelegs</b> than males, which may {{be a result of}} their having to sustain frequent heavy strokes.|$|R
5000|$|In the courbette, {{the horse}} raises its {{forehand}} off the ground, tucks up <b>forelegs</b> evenly, and then jumps forward, never allowing the <b>forelegs</b> to touch down, {{in a series}} of [...] "hops". Extremely strong and talented horses can perform five or more leaps forward before having to touch down with the <b>forelegs,</b> although it is more usual to see a series of three or four leaps. The courbette, like the capriole, is first introduced through the easier croupade.|$|R
5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each <b>foreleg,</b> sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock that is used to break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the <b>foreleg.</b> Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and <b>foreleg,</b> running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

50|$|The two {{subspecies}} can {{be distinguished}} by their color and their stripes. The long-lined skink is gray to light brown in color and has light stripes from the eyes extending to beyond its <b>forelegs,</b> whereas the short-lined skink is darker in color and has stripes that end before the <b>forelegs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The trait {{for which}} these {{butterflies}} are most known {{is the use}} of only four legs; the reason their <b>forelegs</b> have become vestigial is not yet completely clear. Some suggest the <b>forelegs</b> are used to amplify the sense of smell, because some species possess a brush-like set of soft hair called setae, which has led researchers to believe the <b>forelegs</b> are used to improve signaling and communication between the species, while standing in the other four. This ability proves useful in terms of reproduction and the overall health of the species, and it is the leading theory so far.|$|R
5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one <b>foreleg,</b> most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|The horse lands {{first with}} the {{trailing}} (non-leading) <b>foreleg,</b> {{and then with the}} lead <b>foreleg.</b> The hind limbs follow suit. The landing places a great deal of strain on the forelegs, which can lead to injuries or lameness over time.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with many}} other Salticidae, male L. viridis have brightly-colored and large chelicerae which are used as weapons in contests, and {{similarly}} colored <b>forelegs</b> that are waved during visual agonistic displays. [...] The corresponding appendages of females have more muted colors and have significantly lower allometric slopes than those of males. [...] When males encounter each other, they will wave their <b>forelegs</b> and often approach one another until one of them retreats, with a physical fight resulting if neither retreats. During fights, males press their chelicerae and <b>forelegs</b> against each other and push until one tires and retreats.|$|R

25|$|When {{the horse}} is on a lead, the legs on the inside front and hind, have greater {{extension}} than the outside front and hind. Therefore, a horse on the right lead will have its right hind (beat two) come slightly further under its body than the left hindleg had when it grounded (beat one), and the right <b>foreleg</b> (beat three) will reach further out from the horse's body than the left <b>foreleg</b> had extended (beat two).|$|E

25|$|A Biblical commandment {{states a}} shochet must give the <b>foreleg,</b> cheeks and maw to a Kohen {{even though he}} does not own the meat. Thus, it is {{desirable}} that the shochet refuse to perform the shechita unless the animal's owner expresses his agreement to give the gifts. Betei din (Rabbinical courts) {{have the authority to}} excommunicate a shochet who refuses to perform this commandment.|$|E
25|$|In rabbinical {{interpretation}} {{a continuing}} {{application of the}} commandment is identified. Rabbi Yosef Karo Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 61:1, rules that after the slaughter of animal by a shochet (kosher butcher), the cuts of the <b>foreleg,</b> cheek and maw {{should be given to}} a kohen freely, without the kohen paying or performing any service. This giving is required to be free of both monetary and servicial compensation (B.Bechorot 27a).|$|E

Of these 24 gifts, 10 are listed as to be given even outside the land of Israel.

25|$|Although {{their body}} shapes and {{coloring}} vary somewhat, most are shiny black or metallic and have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some species, particularly large Carabinae, rendering the beetles unable to fly. The genus Mormolyce {{is known as}} violin beetles due to their peculiarly shaped elytra. All carabids except the quite primitive flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) have a groove on their <b>foreleg</b> tibiae bearing a comb of hairs used for cleaning their antennae.|$|E

50|$|A male courts {{a female}} by dancing side-to-side, {{forequarters}} held high, displaying his elongated antennae and vibrating his elongated <b>forelegs.</b> A receptive female responds by spreading her <b>forelegs</b> {{to contact the}} male's long <b>forelegs.</b> The male somersaults over her forequarters and flips over to land {{on her back and}} lock onto her genitals. After several minutes of copulation, the female ejects {{a large part of the}} semen and swallows it. Such behaviour seems to correlate with the success of fertile egg production. Given such elaborate behavioural and morphological adaptations, waltzing flies are of interest as a model system for studying of the evolution of sexual dimorphism.|$|R
