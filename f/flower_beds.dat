5|$|After Robinson's death, Gravetye Manor {{was left}} to the Forestry Commission, who left it {{derelict}} for many years. In 1958 it was leased to a restaurateur who refurbished the gardens, replacing some of the <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> with lawn. Today, Gravetye Manor serves as a hotel and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Progress in {{clearing}} and covering the burial ground was slow, {{and it was}} not until 28 October 1880 that the churchyard was reopened as a public park. Laid out with <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> and gravel paths, the park became a popular place for local workers to spend breaks.|$|E

To {{the west of}} the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It {{consists}} of formal <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer Gardens are 1.45 {{acres of}} {{historic}} gardens {{made up of}} native Florida plants, large live oak trees, {{and a number of}} reflecting pools, fountains, ornaments and sculptures. They are split into three themed gardens and a large lawn on the St. Johns River. Many of the original trees on the property were felled in order to make room for <b>flower</b> <b>beds,</b> but those that remained grew up to 150 feet in size. Ninah Cummer adopted the lion as her personal motif, and lion details can be found all over the gardens.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double storied structure built with bricks, rising to {{the height of the}} trees in the well tended garden called Anand Mahal. The garden is laid out with octagonal <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their <b>flower</b> <b>beds.</b> Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} the focus of a Portland Development Commission urban renewal based on a 1982 master plan, {{becoming}} an urban renewal district in 1985, and expiring in July 2008. The park blocks underwent serious renovations in 1987, adding plazas, large <b>flower</b> <b>beds,</b> lighting and irrigation, and newly paved sidewalks. Several apartment complexes specifically aimed at the middle class were built, including the University Park Apartments (125 units, $10.5 million, quickly sold and converted to condos), South Park Square Apartments (184 units, $16 million, completed May 1988), and Tom Mesher's Gallery Park Apartments (31 units, $3 million). In 1987, the New Theater Building of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts was completed immediately next door to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. The South Park Blocks Association, a commercial and institutional association, was started at that time, to attract residents and consumers to the area and to address security concerns.|$|E

25|$|BMRC has {{installed}} a water harvesting system along Reach 1 {{and will be}} doing the same for Reaches 3 & 4. Installation of <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> was delayed due to garbage being dumped on the median by garbage collectors, BMRC will also set up <b>flower</b> <b>beds</b> on Reach 1 with assistance from the horticulture department. However, the work related to this has slowed down due to garbage contractors dumping garbage along the median, {{due to the lack of}} a waste management plan in the city. BMRC will rejuvenate Kengeri and Veerasandra lakes using water collected from a nearby corridor.|$|E

25|$|Roman gardens were {{influenced}} by Egyptian, Persian, and Greek gardening techniques. In Ancient Latium, a garden was part of every farm.

5000|$|In many cases, damp {{is caused}} by [...] "bridging" [...] of a {{damp-proof}} course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled {{up against the wall}} above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the <b>flower</b> <b>bed</b> to below DPC level.|$|R
