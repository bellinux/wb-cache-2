40|$|Cadmium is a nephrotoxic metal with {{increasing}} levels in arable soils. The non-smoking population {{is exposed to}} cadmium mainly from vegetable food, especially cereal products. The major part of pig feed is cereals, and accumulated cadmium in pig kidney could reflect cadmium in the local agricultural environment. In this thesis, the possibility to use pig kidney as a bioindicator {{of the availability of}} cadmium in the agricultural environment was evaluated. There were significant correlations between cadmium levels in soil and wheat, between feed and kidney and between feed and faeces. Cadmium level in feed explained 12 % of the variance of cadmium level in kidney. Cadmium levels in barley, the main ingredient in the feeds, were not correlated to feed or kidney. The non-locally produced <b>feed</b> <b>components</b> rapeseed and soybean meal, vitamin-mineral mixtures and beet fibre contributed to a large extent to the cadmium in feed. The nonlocally produced <b>feed</b> <b>components</b> constitute an external source of cadmium to the arable soils when farmyard manure is applied, as most cadmium in feed is excreted in faeces. Pigs given feeds with less rapeseed and soybean meal and more cereals than controls, had lower cadmium intake, but higher cadmium levels in kidney than control pigs. This can partly be explained by different bioavailability of cadmium in different <b>feed</b> <b>components.</b> Cadmium level in kidney was positively related to age at slaughter and negatively related to kidney weight. No difference in kidney levels of cadmium due to sex was seen. Cadmium levels in kidney differed between breeds given the same feed. Organically outdoor raised pigs had higher levels in kidneys and faeces than conventional pigs raised indoors, despite a lower cadmium level in the organic feed. The organic pigs were exposed to cadmium from soil via rooting. Differences in feed compositions and bioavailability of cadmium from the <b>feed</b> <b>components</b> may also explain the different kidney levels of cadmium. However, no significant difference in solubility of cadmium from the feeds after in vitro digestion was detected. When soil was added to the feed and digested in vitro, the fractional solubility of cadmium was decreased. Animals from the same farm and raised under similar conditions had cadmium levels in kidney that could differ several times. This great variation together with the high cadmium contribution from non-locally produced <b>feed</b> <b>components</b> limit the possibilities to use cadmium in pig kidney as an indicator of available cadmium in the agricultural environment...|$|R

The goal of the diploma thesis' project is to evaluate an effect of various disintegrate of components in hammer and cylindric grinding machine.

40|$|Three {{displacement}} chromatography/pressure swing adsorption {{processes for}} bulk multicomponent gas separation are outlined. Process A, classical displacement chromatography applied to gas systems, employs two mass separating agents: presaturant and displacer. Process B employs the lightest adsorbed <b>feed</b> <b>component</b> as presaturant. Process C uses the lightest <b>feed</b> <b>component</b> as presaturant and the heaviest <b>feed</b> <b>component</b> as displacer. Processes B and C are novel. Experiments showed that displacement development occurs {{with all three}} processes and results for Processes A and B are compared with predictions of a local equilibrium theory for binary PSA. ^ During the feed step of the displacement chromatography/PSA processes large pressure and flow transients were observed. The results of a single stage model confirmed that they are caused by large differences in adsorptivities. Oscillations in pressure and flow, linked to shock wave propagation, were predicted to occur by a tanks-in-series model; they smooth out as the plug flow limit is approached. Experiments with columns in series exhibited oscillations in qualitative agreement with model predictions. ^ Experimental results obtained using a fully automated data acquisition system constructed to study the transients compared well with predictions of a PDE model. It is shown that the lowering in column pressure results in loss of adsorption capacity. A criterion for an a priori determination {{of the magnitude of}} these transients is proposed. Oscillations occur when columns are connected in series. The extent of oscillations depends on the dead volume between columns. The PDE model was employed to study Processes A, B, and C. ^ The role of pressure and flow transients in gas phase adsorptive reactors is studied using a staged model. The gas phase reaction, A + B C, is considered under three situations: (1) a non-reacting <b>feed</b> <b>component,</b> D, adsorbed, (2) both the reactants, A and B, adsorbed, and (3) the product, C, adsorbed.

We used linear programming to create least cost feed formulas for fast-growing broiler (FGB), slow-growing broiler (SGB, i. e. quality label), laying hen and for three contrasting feed-cost situations (January 2006, December 2007 and March 2009). We focused on Eutrophication Potential (EP, a regional impact) and Climate Change (CC, a global impact) which were constraints to formulate low-impact poultry feed. The effects of using these constraints on feed cost and the use of <b>feed</b> <b>components</b> were investigated for a feed production plant in Bretagne (western France). Environmental impacts of poultry feed increased with the energy and protein content of the formula and were affected by the relative costs of <b>feed</b> <b>components.</b> FGB formulas had the highest impacts, followed by formulas for SGB and laying hens. The search for a minimum level of EP and CC of the formula decreased its impacts by 1 - 8 % and by 1 - 12 % respectively, and increased its cost by 2 - 8 %, {{depending on the type of}} feed and the feed-cost situation. Impact reduction was obtained by partial substitution of soybean meal and cereals by rapeseed meal, grain legumes and co-products (wheat bran, gluten). Furthermore, 70 % of the potential reduction of the EP and CC impacts could be obtained at a modest (0. 5 - 4 %) increase in the cost of the formulas. Some other ways to reduce feed impacts were explored, such as taking into account the geographic origin of maize crops and adopting a modified regulatory constraint for SGB formulas. It is important to continue this study by taking into account the whole life cycle of poultry production. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

In total, 18 dietary components were tested with four strains of E. coli, seven strains of Salmonella enterica and two strains of Lactobacillus. RESULTS: A comparison of the results obtained for all Salmonella strains tested revealed that konjac gum and sesame seed extract represented the most efficient binding matrices. Similarly, for all E. coli strains tested, sesame seed extract and artichoke performed well as binding matrices. Salmonella isolates from chickens adhered best to sesame seed extract. E. coli K 88 and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium isolated from pigs effectively bound to Bia-Mos (R), pumpkin, sesame seed extract, and tomato. Sesame seed extract and tomato also had adhesive capacities for E. coli K 99, S. enterica sv. Dublin, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium from calves.
