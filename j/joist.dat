5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar <b>joist</b> and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February, Empire Duchess was in port at Ghent, Belgium {{when there}} was an {{explosion}} and fire in the No. 2 hold. This was caused by a steel <b>joist</b> striking a 25-pounder shell and detonating it whilst the ship was being unloaded. Her Captain, Lieutenant Walter Denton, was Mentioned in Despatches for his actions in fighting the fire and preventing a larger explosion without regard to his personal Safety. She arrived at Hull on 26 February, for repairs which were carried out at Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Empire Duchess departed from Hull on 13 March and resumed service between Southend and Antwerp. She arrived at Southend with Convoy ATM 155 on 16 May.|$|E
25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the {{re-entrant}} angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted chambers are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by <b>joist</b> sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E

The right brigade pivoted on the southern flank amid much German small-arms fire but captured the first objective on the Tower Hamlets (Bassevillebeek) spur. German counter-attacks and fire from <b>Joist</b> Trench and Berry Cottage then pushed the right flank units back to their start line. The left brigade was fired on from a pillbox and Lewis Farm, which had been missed by the bombardment and which hindered an attack on dugouts along {{the north end of}} Gheluvelt wood. The brigade dug-in in short of the final objective, Tower Trench was captured but then abandoned, also due to the fire from Lewis Farm.|$|E

25|$|The {{dwelling}} {{is designed}} in the Federation Bungalow style and built predominantly of jarrah. In 1914 Dr James Battye in his Cyclopedia of Western Australia described the dwelling as follows:From the substantial foundation to the shingle roof {{every part of the}} structure is of jarrah, and after nearly twenty years - the house having been built in 1894 – every plank and beam and <b>joist</b> remain in as sound condition as when first they were cut to the contractor's design. Over twenty rooms are roofed beneath these jarrah shingles, and the interior is fitted up with all that art and comfort can suggest, while surrounding the house is a park of ten acres, tastefully laid out with lawns and flower-beds, and further beautified by the introduction of decorative statuary in bronze, collected by Mr McNeil on various trips to England and the Continent.|$|E

25|$|The Army ordered sutler stores at prison camps {{shut down}} on December 1, 1863 in {{retaliation}} for reported Confederate mistreatment of Union prisoners. The store at Camp Douglas was closed on December 12. After a successful tunneling escape on December 3, Colonel DeLand ordered all floors torn out of barracks, {{to be replaced by}} dirt even with the floor <b>joist.</b> This resulted in conditions that increased sickness and mortality. The garrison also tore out partitions in the barracks. DeLand confiscated warm coats, possibly to prevent escapes but as likely {{in retaliation for}} past escapes and attempts. On December 17, 1863, the prison camp officials closed the barber shop and newsstand, and stopped sales of stamps, envelopes and writing paper, likely also in retaliation for the major escape attempt. When Sergeant–Major Oscar Cliett of the 55th Georgia Infantry Regiment reported to DeLand that his men rejected an offer of amnesty if they joined the Union Navy because they could not swim, DeLand had him placed in the dungeon for twenty-one days. Despite these harsh actions, DeLand also worked to free fifty underage prisoners who he discovered were between the ages of 14 and 17 The Army did not free them.|$|E
500|$|Several people, telling amazing {{stories to}} those who would listen, passed {{themselves}} off as the [...] "sole survivor" [...] in the years following the slide. The most common such tale is that of an infant girl said to have been the only survivor of the slide. Her real name unknown, the girl was called [...] "Frankie Slide". Several stories were told of her miraculous escape: she was found in a bale of hay, lying on rocks, under the collapsed roof of her house or in the arms of her dead mother. The legend was based primarily on the story of Marion Leitch, who was thrown from her home into a pile of hay when the slide enveloped her home. [...] Her sisters also survived; they were found unharmed under a collapsed ceiling <b>joist.</b> Her parents and four brothers died. Influencing the story was the survival of two-year-old Gladys Ennis, who was found outside her home in the mud. [...] The last survivor of the slide, she died in 1995.

However, the most demanding part of the project was the construction, transport and installation of the armoured turrets and the armament itself. Two companies had been previously contracted for the construction of other fortifications in Sweden, Swedish AB Bofors-Gullspång and French Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon, offers from both companies existed already in 1901, {{but it was not until}} after tests conducted in December 1902 that the Swedish company was contracted and given royal approval on 26 May 1903.

50|$|Robb Engineering gained notoriety {{during the}} 1990s after being blamed as {{the maker of}} faulty open web steel <b>joists.</b> Poor welds {{weakened}} the <b>joists.</b> In some cases the roof <b>joists</b> have experienced catastrophic failure, resulting in at least 1 roof collapse. With the collapse of 3 <b>joists</b> in 3 separate buildings confirmed, an inspection of all governmental structures was conducted in eastern Canada surveying how many of Robb Engineering's <b>joists</b> were being used.

2500|$|Before {{construction}} can begin, {{the structural}} ironworkers {{put together the}} cranes {{that will be used}} to lift the steel columns, beams, and girders according to blueprints to erect a structure. To hoist the steel, structural ironworkers use cables connected to the crane to lift the beams onto the steel columns. [...] A rope called a tagline is attached to the beams so an ironworker can control the beams if necessary. [...] The crane hoists steel into place, and the ironworkers position the beams in place with spud wrenches to align bolt holes. [...] Then, the beams can be bolted to the steel columns. [...] This process is continued until there are no beams or columns left to construct the structure.

Recently a new LSF floor system made of welded hollow flange channel (HFC) section was developed and its fire performance was investigated using full scale fire tests. The new floor systems gave higher fire resistance ratings in comparison to conventional LSF floor systems. To avoid expensive and time consuming full scale fire tests, finite element analyses were also performed to simulate the fire performance of LSF floors made of HFC <b>joists</b> using both steady and transient state methods.
