5|$|The after-battle monster {{recruitment}} {{has been}} removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicon version of Dragon Quest VI, {{certain types of}} monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will <b>join</b> <b>you</b> once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable.|$|E
500|$|So ... {{what have}} you listened to for a good time that isn't, after all, a 'traditional' song? Still playing the Mike Oldfield records, huh? Still {{whipping}} Yessongs on for a good time? Wanna count on one hand {{how many people have}} fun at a Sonic Youth gig? I'm not supporting The Choirboys, old man, I'm just saying that the day some jumped-up over-paid self-important post-modernist cocksucker puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer {{in the middle of his}} 47-minute opus [...] "The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig-God" [...] and belts out the chords to [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] is the day I'll <b>join</b> <b>you</b> at the footlights of post-modernism.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to <b>join</b> <b>you</b> – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the cool of the evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

2500|$|Upon the disestablishment of {{religion}} in Connecticut, he wrote to John Adams: [...] "I <b>join</b> <b>you,</b> therefore, in sincere congratulations that this den of the priesthood is at length broken up, and that a Protestant Popedom is no longer to disgrace the American history and character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baker {{claimed in}} a later {{statement}} {{that he had been}} drinking and was tired from the long flight. He reported that after Prunier and he were split-up at airport immigration, they had met up again at the baggage carousel, and Prunier had told him [...] "I haven't seen your bag yet, Nick. You grab this and get in a queue and I'll <b>join</b> <b>you</b> when yours comes out." [...] When the bag Baker was carrying was searched in customs, 41,120 tablets of ecstasy and 992.5grams of cocaine were found hidden in false compartments of the suitcase, the largest single illegal drugs haul at Narita airport at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Around 210, Liu Zhang {{was serving}} as the Governor (牧) of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), and he faced the threat of his rival Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhou Yu went to see Sun Quan and proposed, [...] "Cao Cao is still {{recovering}} from his defeats and he faces internal threats, so he will not {{go to war with}} you any time soon. I ask for you to allow me and Sun Yu to invade Shu (Yi Province) and attack Zhang Lu after that. Sun Yu will then remain behind to defend the captured territories and form an alliance with Ma Chao. I'll <b>join</b> <b>you</b> in attacking Cao Cao at Xiangyang, and we can conquer the north." [...] Sun Quan agreed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiative}} to invade Kentucky came primarily from Confederate Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, {{commander of the}} Department of East Tennessee. He believed the campaign {{would allow them to}} obtain supplies, enlist recruits, divert Union troops from Tennessee, and claim Kentucky for the Confederacy. In July 1862 Col. John Hunt Morgan carried out a successful cavalry raid in the state, venturing deeply into the rear areas of Buell's department. The raid caused considerable consternation in Buell's command and in Washington, D.C. During the raid, Morgan and his forces were cheered and supported by many residents. He added 300 Kentucky volunteers to his 900-man force during the raid. He confidently promised Kirby Smith, [...] "The whole country can be secured, and 25,000 or 30,000 men will <b>join</b> <b>you</b> at once." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was in the}} {{greatest}} affliction {{at the loss of}} my son, and was consumed by a desire to know what was his position in the other world. God deigned to comfort me. About a month after his death, during a very restless night, I saw, as it were, the ceiling opened, and Dominic appeared in the midst of dazzling light. I was beside myself at this sight, and cried out: [...] "O Dominic, my son, are you already in Paradise?" [...] "Yes," [...] he replied, [...] "I am in Heaven." [...] Then pray for your brothers and sisters, and your mother and father, that we may all come to <b>join</b> <b>you</b> one day in Heaven." [...] "Yes, yes, I will pray," [...] was the answer. [...] "Then he disappeared, and the room became as before." ...|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{administrative}} officer in Changshan recommended Zhao Yun {{to serve in the}} government. Zhao Yun then led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province who was nominally a General of the Household (中郎將) under the Han central government. Around the time, another warlord Yuan Shao was recently appointed as the Governor (牧) of Ji Province and his fame was steadily rising, so Gongsun Zan was worried that many people in You Province would choose to serve under Yuan instead of him. When Zhao Yun came to join him, he mocked Zhao, [...] "I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. Why did you have a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?" [...] Zhao Yun replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and it's unclear who is right and who is wrong. The people are in danger. Those in my home province, after careful deliberation, decided to follow a lord who practises benevolent governance. Therefore, I chose to <b>join</b> <b>you,</b> General, instead of Lord Yuan." [...] He participated in some of Gongsun Zan's battles against rival forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 208, Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, {{died and}} was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong. Later that year, when the warlord Cao Cao invaded Jing Province, Liu Cong {{surrendered}} {{and much of}} northern Jing Province came under Cao Cao's control. Liu Bei led his forces {{and a large number}} of civilians south to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which was independent of Cao Cao's control and where Liu Biao's elder son, Liu Qi, was based. Xu Shu accompanied Liu Bei on his journey towards Xiakou. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei. They caught up with him and defeated him at the Battle of Changban. Cao Cao's men captured Xu Shu's mother during the battle, so Xu Shu decided to leave Liu Bei to reunite with his mother. Before leaving, he pointed at his heart and told Liu Bei, [...] "I wanted to <b>join</b> <b>you,</b> General, in making great achievements. This is my purpose in life. Now that I've lost my mother, I've also lost my sense of direction. This isn't going to be helpful. Now I bid farewell to you." [...] He went to join Cao Cao. Shi Tao also followed him and both of them came to serve Cao Cao.|$|E
