50|$|Veterinarians employ three general methods: tonometry, <b>gonioscopy,</b> and ophthalmoscopy. Tonometry {{measures}} the intraocular pressure with an instrument. Normal intraocular pressure in dogs can ranges from , and both eyes should be similar in pressure. <b>Gonioscopy</b> is a diagnostic procedure {{to examine the}} angle of the anterior chamber. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy is necessary to evaluate the retina and particularly the optic nerve.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the details}} vary {{based on the}} type of goniolens used, in general the <b>gonioscopy</b> process involves: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gonioscopy</b> employs total {{internal}} reflection to view the anatomical angle formed between the eye's cornea and iris.|$|E
5000|$|Indentation gonioscopy: An {{extension}} of the above two concepts, indentation <b>gonioscopy</b> involves the applied pressure of the goniolens against the eye, acutely raising the intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber and subsequently opening up the iridocorneal angle mechanically, allowing {{a greater understanding of}} the nature of the anterior synechiae. In the absence of synechiae, indentation <b>gonioscopy</b> may reveal the area where the cornea and iris are truly anatomically attached, as compared to where they are simply apposed against each other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gonioscopy</b> is {{performed}} during eye examinations, which involves placing a mirrored {{lens on the}} patient's cornea in order to visualise {{the angle of the}} Anterior chamber of eyeball.|$|E
50|$|Proxymetacaine {{hydrochloride}} ophthalmic solution (eye drops) {{is indicated}} for procedures such as tonometry, <b>gonioscopy,</b> removal of foreign bodies, or other similar procedures requiring topical anesthesia of the cornea and conjunctiva.|$|E
5000|$|Glaucoma is {{currently}} the principal cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Therefore, The Van Herick technique is pertinent {{to the interests of}} all eye care practitioners as it permits for a quick and simple screening alternative to the conventional <b>Gonioscopy</b> examination. It should not however, be used as a replacement for the <b>gonioscopy</b> examination but rather be used as a means of refuting or confirming the results of a <b>gonioscopy</b> examination. The Van Herick’s technique has become the most commonly used qualitative method of assessing the size of the anterior chamber angle (ACA). Whereby, it involves comparing the depth of the peripheral anterior chamber to the thickness of the cornea, when a narrow beam is shone within the limbus at a 60°angle. The anterior chamber drainage angle is then graded as a ratio between the peripheral anterior chamber depth and corneal thickness (AC : C ratio) [...] or expressed traditionally as a fraction [...] to provide the Van Herick’s result. Grading can also be obtained by distinguishing the structures visible upon observation. Each visible structure correlates to a Van Herick grade which can then be expressed a fraction.|$|E
5000|$|Schwalbe's {{line is the}} {{anatomical}} line found on the interior surface of the eye's cornea, and delineates the outer limit of the corneal endothelium layer. Specifically, it represents the termination of Descemet's membrane. [...] In many cases {{it can be seen}} via <b>gonioscopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gonioscopy</b> {{describes}} {{the use of}} a goniolens (also known as a gonioscope) in conjunction with a slit lamp or operating microscope to gain a view of the iridocorneal angle, or the anatomical angle formed between the eye's cornea and iris. The importance of this process is in diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions associated with glaucoma.|$|E
50|$|Sampaolesi {{line is a}} sign {{which may}} be {{observed}} during a clinical eye examination. During <b>gonioscopy</b> (where the structures of the eye's anterior segment are examined), if an abundance of brown pigment is seen at or anterior to Schwalbe's line, a Sampaolesi line {{is said to be}} present. The presence of a Sampaolesi line can signify pigment dispersion syndrome or pseudoexfoliation syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{although}} the Van Herick offers {{a quick and}} simple alternative to <b>gonioscopy</b> examinations, it also comes with limitations to its results. Principally, it has been deduced that measurements performed at the nasal limbus tend to overestimate the angle width. Moreover, {{although the}} technique relies on the subjective assessment of the observed structures, {{it has been found}} that the results are not easily replicated and there was a high level of variability depending on the perception of the examiner. The technique also may be considered of inadequate scope, as it only provides an estimate of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) at the temporal limbus, in contrast with <b>gonioscopy,</b> which allows for a 360 degree view of the anterior chamber. Furthermore, the Van Herick technique {{has been found to be}} exceedingly sensitive to the positioning of the direct slit-lamp beam whereby a 10 degrees deviation from the perpendicular direction was found to be critical to the results and measurements.|$|E
5000|$|Anterior synechiae: Anterior synechiae {{are simply}} stands of the iris {{attaching}} to the iridocorneal angle or surrounding tissue. This may be exacerbated by ocular inflammation, which can render the angle 'sticky' with inflammatory cells and substances, or by structural defects in the iris {{which lead to}} strands floating free into the anterior chamber, as may occur with iris atrophy and congenital iris defects. <b>Gonioscopy</b> allows a direct view of these synechiae, and is thus especially helpful for the more subtle cases.|$|E
5000|$|Zeiss {{indirect}} goniolens: {{this instrument}} uses a similar method to the Goldmann, but employs prisms {{in the place}} of mirrors. Its four symmetrical prisms allow visualisation of the iridocorneal angle in four quadrants of the eye simultaneously, and works well with a slit lamp. Most importantly, {{the size and shape of}} the instrument - a smaller front surface that rests on the cornea without requiring lubricating fluid, only the patient's tear film - allows for indentation <b>gonioscopy,</b> which can be used for further diagnosis.|$|E

5000|$|Iridocorneal angle width: The {{width of}} the iridocorneal angle is one factor {{affecting}} the drainage of aqueous humour from the eye's anterior chamber. A wide angle allows sufficient drainage of humour through the trabecular meshwork (unless obstructed), whereas a narrow angle may impede the drainage system and leave the patient susceptible to acute angle-closure glaucoma. <b>Gonioscopy</b> indicates the angular {{width of the}} iridocorneal angle {{by the number of}} ocular structures visible above the rim of the iris. Generally the more structures visible, the wider the angle. However, not all structures may be easily discriminated, especially the faint Schwalbe's line {{at the top of the}} stack. Further information is obtained if a very narrow slit lamp beam may be shone upon the angle, as the angle width is generally proportional to the separation of the corneal beam and iris beam when they meet in the angle.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} interobserver, intervisit, and interinstrument agreements for <b>gonioscopy</b> and Fourier domain anterior segment {{optical coherence tomography}} (FD ASOCT) {{for classifying}} open and narrow angle eyes. Methods. Eighty-six eyes with open or narrow anterior chamber angles were included. The superior angle was classified open or narrow by 2 of 5 glaucoma specialists using <b>gonioscopy</b> and imaged by FD ASOCT in the dark. The superior angle of each FD ASOCT image was graded as open or narrow by 2 masked readers. The same procedures were repeated within 6 months.

40|$|Purpose: To compare clarity, {{exposure}} {{and quality of}} anterior chamber angle visualization in congenital glaucoma patients, using RetCam and indirect <b>gonioscopy</b> images. Design: Cross-sectional study Participants. Congenital glaucoma patients over age of 5 years. Materials and Methods: A prospective consecutive pilot study was done in congenital glaucoma patients who were older than 5 years. Methods used are indirect <b>gonioscopy</b> and RetCam imaging. Clarity of the image, extent of angle visible and details of angle structures seen were graded for both methods, on digitally recorded images, in each eye, by two masked observers. Outcome Measures: Image clarity, interobserver agreement. Results: 40 eyes of 25 congenital glaucoma patients were studied. RetCam image had excellent clarity in 77. 5 % of patients versus 47. 5 % by <b>gonioscopy.</b> The extent of angle seen was similar by both methods. Agreement between RetCam and <b>gonioscopy</b> images regarding details of angle structures was 72. 50 % by observer 1 and 65. 00 % by observer 2. Conclusions: There was good agreement between RetCam and indirect <b>gonioscopy</b> images in detecting angle structures of congenital glaucoma patients. However, RetCam provided greater clarity, with better quality, and higher magnification images.

40|$|Purpose. To {{design and}} test a new noninvasive method for {{anterior}} chamber angle (ACA) estimation {{based on the}} slit lamp that is accessible to all eye-care professionals.; Methods. A new technique (slit lamp anterior chamber estimation [SLACE]) that aims to overcome some {{of the limitations of}} the van Herick procedure was designed. The technique, which only requires a slit lamp, was applied to estimate the ACA of 50 participants (100 eyes) using two different slit lamp models, and results were compared with <b>gonioscopy</b> as the clinical standard.; Results. The Spearman nonparametric correlation between ACA values as determined by <b>gonioscopy</b> and SLACE were 0. 81 (p < 0. 001) and 0. 79 (p < 0. 001) for each slit lamp. Sensitivity values of 100 and 87. 5 % and specificity values of 75 and 81. 2 %, depending on the slit lamp used, were obtained for the SLACE technique as compared with <b>gonioscopy</b> (Spaeth classification).; Conclusions. The SLACE technique, when compared with <b>gonioscopy,</b> displayed good accuracy in the detection of narrow angles, and it may be useful for eye-care clinicians without access to expensive alternative equipment or those who cannot perform <b>gonioscopy</b> because of legal constraints regarding the use of diagnostic drugs.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{ultrasound}} biomicroscopic {{measurement of the}} anterior chamber angle in Asian Indian eyes, with the angle width estimated by <b>gonioscopy.</b> Materials and Methods: Participants: Patients with open and closed angles attending a glaucoma clinic were recruited for the study. Observation Procedures: Temporal quadrants of the angles of patients were categorized by <b>gonioscopy</b> as Grade 0 to Grade 4, using Shaffer&#x 2032;s classification. These angles were quantified by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) using the following biometric characteristics: Angle opening distance at 250 &#x 00 B 5; (AOD 250) and 500 &#x 00 B 5; (AOD 500) from the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork-ciliary process distance (TCPD). The angles were further segregated as "narrow angles" (Schaffer&#x 2032;s Grade 2 or less) and "open angles" (Schaffer&#x 2032;s Grade 3 and 4). Main Outcome Measures: The UBM measurements were computed in each case and analyzed {{in relation to the}} gonioscopic angle evaluation. Results: One hundred and sixty three eyes of 163 patients were analyzed. One hundred and six eyes had "narrow angles" and 57 eyes had "open angles" on <b>gonioscopy.</b> There was a significant difference among the mean UBM measurements of each angle grade estimated by <b>gonioscopy</b> (P < 0. 001). The Pearson correlation coefficient between all UBM parameters and <b>gonioscopy</b> grades was significant at the 0. 01 level.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} of <b>gonioscopy,</b> van Herick method and anterior segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) {{and determine the}} agreement between these techniques within a community optometry setting. Methods: <b>Gonioscopy,</b> van Herick method and AS-OCT imaging were performed by an optometrist on two occasions, 1 month apart, on 80 subjects aged over 40 years recruited from community optometry practices. Anterior segment images were captured with a spectral domain OCT (Topcon 3 D OCT- 2000; wavelength 840 nm) set to the Anterior Segment (AS) mode. Eyes were graded as open or occludable for each method.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} performance of glaucoma specialists and experienced optometrists in <b>gonioscopy</b> and optic disc assessment. MethodsThis study {{was done to}} validate the diagnostic performance of two experienced optometrists for using their skills of detecting glaucoma using <b>gonioscopy</b> and optic disc assessment in a major epidemiological study, the L V Prasad Eye Institute Glaucoma Epidemiology and Molecular Genetics Study (LVPEI-GLEAMS). Gonioscopic findings for 150 eyes were categorized as 0, 1 and 2 for open angle, primary angle closure suspect (PACS) and primary angle closure (PAC) respectively. Optic disc findings for 200 eyes were categorized as 0, 1 and 2 for normal, suspects and glaucomatous respectively. Weighted kappa (κ) and diagnostic accuracy parameters were calculated. Two optometrists (# 1 and # 2) participated in the study. ResultsAgreement between glaucoma specialists and optometrist for interpretation of <b>gonioscopy</b> to discriminate PACS and PAC from open angles and for interpretation of optic disc to discriminate glaucomatous and suspicious discs from normal, the kappa (κ) was 0. 92 and 0. 84 and 0. 90 and 0. 89 for optometrists # 1 and # 2 respectively.
