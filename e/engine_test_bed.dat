5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK was converted for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E

25|$|One-off <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>bed,</b> {{converted}} from former No. 616 Squadron RAF operational F.1 serial number EE227, for the Rolls-Royce Trent turboprop engine {{making it the}} world's first turboprop-powered aircraft. The undercarriage was lengthened to give ground clearance for the initial 7 ft 7 inch Rotol airscrews. First flying in September 1945, it was not shown publicly until June 1946. It was found that separate controls for thrust and constant speed units required a lot of skill to manage. It was then flown with higher engine thrust and smaller propellers to enable development of a combined control system. The development programme was complete by 1948.|$|E

50|$|It {{was soon}} {{found that the}} {{aircraft}} {{could not be used}} as an escort due to the limited field of fire for the single lewis gun but the R.E.7 had a useful payload and was soon used as a light bomber with the more powerful engine (either a 150 hp (112 kW) RAF 4a or 160 hp (119 kW) Beardmore). Over a quarter of the aircraft built were used in France in the middle of 1916 but their slow speed and low ceiling with a bomb load made them vulnerable to attack. The R.E.7s were withdrawn and used for training and a number were used as <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>beds.</b> Use was made of them as target tugs trailing a sleeve drogue for air-to-air firing practice, probably one of the first aircraft to do this.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a solid and robust automation model {{which has been}} developed and implemented in two different research <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>beds</b> which were instrumented, one for diesel {{and the other one}} for spark ignition engines. The model, programmed in Matlab, is based on transfer functions with a decoupled (two single input single output systems) independent proportional and integral action controller that allows setting the desired engine speed and torque under stationary operation conditions. It was implemented in a Freescale HC 08 family microcontroller external to the PC {{in order to avoid the}} risk of losing control during undesirable communication delays on the computer. The model has been validated in a wide range of engine operating modes, from low to high speeds and loads showing a good response. The first order transfer functions with delay have proven to be a good approximation even during the nonlinearities caused by turbocharger and electronic control unit incorporated in the engines. This low cost automation system has been tested for the last three years in a university engine laboratory showing a good performance...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigations on the exhaust emissions carried out under real operating conditions of gasoline engines operating in a power generator and a chainsaw. During the operation of these devices the authors measured the following exhaust emissions: CO, HC, NOx and CO 2. For the measurements the authors used a portable exhaust emission analyzer SEMTECH DS by SENSORS. This analyzer measures the concentrations of the exhaust gas components in an on-line mode while the engine is running under real operating conditions (road, field etc.). The exhaust emissions <b>tests</b> of non-road <b>engine</b> applications are performed on <b>engine</b> <b>test</b> <b>beds</b> in the NRSC (ISO 8178) and NRTC tests. The presented method is a new solution in determining of the exhaust emissions from such engines. The obtained results were compared with the applicable emission requirements. Besides, based on the performed investigations, the authors attempted an evaluation of the possibilities of the use of the measurement method for development works related to the reduction of the emission from small gasoline engines...|$|R
