5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
5|$|When Itachi {{is first}} {{mentioned}} by Sasuke in the manga, Kishimoto had not planned about the character's backstory. The only idea <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> to attribute to Itachi some violent action {{that would have}} Sasuke wanting to kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clans under their orders. Itachi was originally conceived {{as the leader of}} Konoha's Special Assassination and Tactical Squad, dubbed the , which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specialising in assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in favor of the current Itachi working for Akatsuki. From all the Akatsuki characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his backstory.|$|E
60|$|Young Ross Shanklin had toiled in hell; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> escaped, {{more than}} once; and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> caught and {{sent back to}} toil in other and various hells. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> triced up and lashed till <b>he</b> fainted, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> revived and lashed again. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the dungeon ninety days at a time. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> {{experienced}} the torment of the straightjacket. He knew what the humming bird <b>was.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> farmed out as a chattel {{by the state to}} the contractors. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trailed through swamps by blood hounds. Twice <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shot. For six years on end <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut a cord and a half of wood each day in a convict lumber camp. Sick or well, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> cut that cord and a half or paid for it under a whip-lash knotted and pickled.|$|R

25|$|Despite bold {{predictions}} that Woods might again {{challenge for the}} Grand Slam, he did not mount a serious charge at the 2008 Masters Tournament, struggling with his putter through each round. He would still finish alone in second, three strokes behind the champion, Trevor Immelman. On April 15, 2008, he underwent his third left knee arthroscopic surgery in Park City, Utah, and missed two months on the PGA Tour. The first surgery <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> in 1994, {{when he had a}} benign tumor removed, and the second in December 2002. He was named Men's Fitnesss Fittest Athlete in the June/July 2008 issue.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E
25|$|With the war over, {{the group}} {{collects}} {{the core of}} the Heart of Gold and the Ashes, the only two components of the Wikkit Gate not destroyed by the robots, and returns Zaphod and Marvin to the Heart of Gold. Returning only moments after the robots' attack at the Lord's Cricket Grounds, Arthur attempts to return the Ashes, but is suddenly inspired to bowl one shot at a wicket that is being defended using a cricket ball in his bag. However, in mid-throw, Arthur suddenly realises that the ball <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> created and placed in his bag by Hactar and is actually the working version of the cosmic-supernova-bomb, and that the defender of the wicket is one of the Krikkit robots, ready to detonate the bomb once thrown, all this causing him to trip, miss the ground, and allow him to fly. Arthur is able to throw the ball aside and disable the robot in mid-swoop.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the meeting}} in Cologne, Papen and Hitler had been photographed going into Schröder's house {{and the next day}} 5 January 1933 the news of the Hitler-Papen summit was front-page news all over Germany. Schleicher did not regard the Papen-Hitler talks as a threat, {{regarding}} Papen as a silly and foolish man unable to accomplish anything. On 9 January 1933, Papen met with Hindenburg to tell him that he believed that Hitler was now willing to support a presidential government headed by himself. That same day, Papen met with Schleicher to tell him that he had only been seeking to have Hitler support his government at the Cologne meeting, and furthermore <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> not angry about being ousted by him or Schleicher's attacks on him in public. Based on what Papen had told him, Schleicher now believed Hitler was now only seeking to be the defense or interior minister in his government. To continue the talks which started in Cologne, it was decided that henceforth that Papen and Hitler would meet at the house of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin as Ribbentrop was a Nazi who was also an old friend of Papen's going back to their service together in the Ottoman Empire in 1917-18.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad did {{not respond}} well to the episode, observing that [...] "Argus" [...] would go down 30 Rock history as [...] "one of the worst episodes of the series." [...] One of the {{problems}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> that the Jack character bonded with the peacock for the entire episode. [...] "As I've said before, I hate the episodes where Jack {{is out of control}} or acting goofy or involved in some lame pursuit, and this one of the more lame pursuits." ...|$|E
500|$|Denning {{was noted}} for his {{excellent}} memory, repeating notes almost verbatim in his exams at Oxford {{and on one}} occasion identifying the exact book, page and paragraph of text in a judgment that covered a particular situation. As a judge he attempted to make his decisions and the law publicly understandable, believing that the public {{would not want to}} follow the law unless they believed and understood that it was just. In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no business premises. All <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. So they went to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E

2500|$|... 1777 {{was another}} great year for Hambledon with Hampshire playing All-England six times and winning four of them. At Sevenoaks Vine on 18, 19 and 20 June, Hampshire {{defeated}} All-England by an innings and 168 runs. James Aylward made the then record score {{in an individual}} innings with 167 as Hampshire amassed 403, a massive total in 18th century conditions. Among several sizeable partnerships <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> one with Nyren, who scored 37, for the 7th wicket. In August, Nyren had a good game with the ball, taking 4 wickets in the first innings, as Hampshire beat All-England by 1 wicket at Guildford Bason.|$|E

Following radiographies, he was transferred from Docente Regional Hospital to Víctor Lazarte Echegaray National Hospital, where he underwent overnight surgery, but never awoke from the operation and died at [...] the next day. He was survived by at least one brother, Vigilio, his wife Rita de Sagástegui and nine children. Although he had hoped some of them, who mostly became scientist, would take up this area of study, the closest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> an agronomist. His funeral services were held at the UNT with speeches by several current and former officials of the University.|$|E
2500|$|Rutten's {{main reason}} {{of success in}} Pancrase was his well-rounded {{fighting}} style, excelling both in striking and grappling. His stand-up offensive, learned from the Dutch school of muay thai, was aggressive yet deceptively technical. According to Frank Shamrock, it often intimidated other fighters. He would say, [...] "His kickboxing was devastating. It was something everybody feared. The other thing <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> {{a basic understanding of}} real fighting... Bas had that street fighter mentality." [...] One of his favored tactics was unbalancing his opponents with push kicks against the ring ropes before overwhelming them with palm strikes and body punches, nullifying their ability to counterattack or defend. Also, Rutten never developed an effective takedown defense, but he was apt in landing strikes while being taken down, having knocked out opponents before they could complete the technique. The most famous aspect of his striking, however, was his scientific skill to target the opponent's liver, using punches, knees and kicks to damage it and incapacitate his adversary.|$|E

2500|$|Before Anderson {{became a}} filmmaker, {{one of the}} jobs <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> as an {{assistant}} for a television game show, Quiz Kid Challenge, an experience he incorporated into the script for Magnolia. He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by The Beatles, and [...] "it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again". The production designers looked at films with close, tight color palettes, films that were warm and analyzed why they did that and then applied it to Magnolia. They also wanted to evoke {{the colors of the}} magnolia flower: greens, browns and off-whites. For the section of the prologue that is set in 1911, Anderson used a hand-cranked pathé camera that would have been used at the time. Some of the actors were nervous about singing the lyrics to Mann's [...] "Wise Up" [...] in the film's climactic scene and so Anderson had Moore do it first and she set the pace and everyone else followed.|$|E
2500|$|Syvret's appeal against {{conviction}} to the Royal Court, Commissioner Sir Christopher Pitchers presiding, {{started on}} 1 August 2011. Syvret maintained {{that he was}} protecting the public by naming [...] "Nurse M" [...] on his blog and argued that the motive of the police in searching his home {{when he was arrested}} was to find evidence to discredit former police chief Graham Power and former deputy police chief Lenny Harper. The Royal Court repeated criticisms of the police actions in raiding Syvrets' home, arresting him and keeping him in custody. The court also held that in the Magistrate's Court the prosecution [...] "lead some evidence which went further than was necessary in supporting the robustness of the 1999 enquiry" [...] but found that the Assistant Magistrate's conclusions had not been influenced by this. The court rejected Syvret's submissions that disclosure of the nurses' names was justified as being in the public interest. The court added that [...] "The public interest is served by measured, responsible and accurate reporting. [...] The way that the appellant dealt with the information that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> none of these". The court dismissed Syvret's appeal on the data protection offences but allowed his appeal in relation to two counts of contempt of court.|$|E
2500|$|Col. Borland's call {{received}} an almost immediate response, {{but he continued}} to harbor serious misgivings about his situation. On November 10, he wrote to Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, C.S.A., commanding the 1st Division Western Department, at Columbus, Kentucky, and told of his call for reinforcements from the militia. He said the response was [...] "somewhat tumultuous." [...] On November 9, 1,000 men had arrived unorganized and so ill-supplied with arms that be deemed it best to direct them to return home. They followed this direction and assured Borland that within a week's time he would have at least 3,000 men at his command. He told them that companies thus organized and prepared would be received into service for 30 days {{from the time they}} reported again to him. Borland added a postscript to this letter, saying that he had just received a report from his scouts that a Federal force of 7,450 was between Reeve's Station and Greenville in Missouri. He told Gen. Polk that the force <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> wholly insufficient for either attack or defense. It should be three times as large or be abandoned altogether; and finally he asked to be relieved of his command. [...] "It is a Brigadier’s command, and should have his responsibility, which I am daily growing more and more distrustful of my competency to sustain. Public interests here would be better provided for by other and abler hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E
