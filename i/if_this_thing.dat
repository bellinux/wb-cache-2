500|$|On September 2, 2008, {{a record}} store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic {{nearly two weeks}} before its {{scheduled}} worldwide release date, {{which resulted in the}} album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich [...] responded to the leak by saying, [...] "...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me", and, [...] "By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{declined}} {{to raise taxes}} for education, which led him to oppose a ballot initiative to amend the Florida Constitution so as to cap growing school class sizes. Bush said he had [...] "a couple of devious plans <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> passes". Despite his opposition, the amendment passed.|$|E
2500|$|If any man take a wife, {{and go in}} unto her, … and say, / I {{took this}} woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid. / … But <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: / Then they shall bring out the damsel {{to the door of}} her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.

6000|$|... "Good night, you sleepy little soul!" [...] It {{seemed to}} Colville {{that he must}} be a pretty good man, after all, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> little <b>thing</b> loved him so.|$|R
60|$|ASHER. That's so. We'll be the paupers, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> sort of <b>thing</b> keeps on.|$|R
2500|$|Critics of {{the concept}} argue that its vagueness {{undermines}} its effectiveness, {{that it has become}} little more than a vehicle for activists wishing to promote certain causes, and that it does not help the research community understand what security means or help decision makers to formulate good policies. Alternatively, other scholars have argued that the concept of human security should be broadened to encompass military security: 'In other words, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> called ‘human security’ has the concept of ‘the human’ embedded at the heart of it, then let us address the question of the human condition directly. Thus understood, human security would no longer be the vague amorphous add-on to harder edged areas of security such as military security or state security.' ...|$|E

60|$|THE MAIDEN. Dont {{you think}} all that is rather silly? We cannot go on as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> kind of <b>thing,</b> <b>this</b> dancing and sweethearting, were everything.|$|R
6000|$|... (Steadily.) <b>If</b> you do <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> {{you shall}} {{cease to be}} my father forever. You shall cease to exist so far as I am concerned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Huck, {{you know}} I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides <b>if</b> you'll try <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> just {{a while longer}} you'll come to like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help feeling," [...] {{explained}} Peter, [...] "a {{sense of}} duty in this matter. The child came to me. It is as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> had been laid upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, old chap,' said Frank, 'I {{may as well}} {{be honest}} with you. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> goes against me, I am stony broke. I don't know where your costs are coming from.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I think {{everything}} was given up. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> had been of value I should, perhaps, {{have told the}} sheik; but as it was only written papers, and of no use to anyone, I did not trouble to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} think it's worth troubling about. The arm will bend all right," [...] he said. [...] "Still, perhaps, you wouldn't mind {{very much}} <b>if</b> I took <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> off." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And don't {{be talking}} to her about money before she starts. I had rather you didn't;--you understand. But when you see Crofts, tell {{him to come to}} me. Indeed, he'd better come at once, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> is to go on quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, captain; I {{thought as}} a friend I would speak my mind. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> should really get into the papers in America, it would spread like fire in the prairies. You know what the papers are, I trust, Captain Truck?" ...|$|E
60|$|BRODIE. Hear me, Mary. This is a {{big moment}} in our two lives. I swear to you by the father here between us that it shall not be fault of mine <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> fails; if this ship founders you have set your hopes in. I swear it by our father; I swear it by God's judgments.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, {{putting aside}} his bowl, {{and looking at}} her dreamily. It seemed as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> young prattling <b>thing</b> were some memory come back {{out of his own}} youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose I {{could have}} done so either in the old times," [...] Ned said with a faint smile. [...] "My blood used to be hot enough, a good deal too hot, but I don't think {{anything}} could get it up to boiling point now, so you see <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> {{had to be done}} at all it must have been in cold blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] Mr. Waddington objected, [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> really passes off, you'll be only too glad to. I suppose I shall flirt with Milly again, and drink beer, give up Ruskin for the Sporting Times, wear loud clothes, tell most frightful falsehoods when I sell that terrible {{furniture}} and buy another trotting horse {{to drive out}} on Sundays. Oh, Lord!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Man to man, John," [...] Stephen said, as {{he gripped}} his brother by the hands, [...] "I love you this moment as I always {{have done and}} as I always shall do. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> must be between us, I'll say but one last word, and you'll take it from me, even though I am the only man on earth you'd take it from. Before you marry, ask her!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you?" [...] {{she cried}} in a ringing voice. [...] "I shall curse you. All my life I shall loathe and hate you, holding you in horror for a murderer <b>if</b> you do <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> You fool! Can you not see? You fool!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR,--I request your {{attention}} to the enclosed.

60|$|As for Cynthia, {{nothing was}} farther from her mind. Unchristian {{as was the}} thought, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> she had awakened {{could only have been}} put back to sleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would she have been happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than sincerity, he {{received}} the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days she welcomed Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston, including Moses himself, began thinking of a wedding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{offer you}} such swell {{quarters}} in New York, March," [...] Fulkerson said, {{as he went}} tack-tacking down the steps with his small boot-heels. [...] "But I've got my eye on a little house round in West Eleventh Street that I'm going to fit up for my bachelor's hall in the third story, and adapt for 'The Lone Hand' {{in the first and}} second, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> goes through; and I guess we'll be pretty comfortable. It's right on the Sand Strip--no malaria of any kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Rose, [...] "that, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> goes no farther, it will {{gradually}} die out {{even in that}} circle; and, in the better circles of New York, I trust {{it will not be}} heard of. Mrs. Van Astrachan and I will appear publicly with Lillie; and if she is seen with us, and at this house, it will be sufficient to contradict a dozen slanders. She has the noblest, kindest husband,--one of the best men and truest gentlemen I ever knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will do me a {{world of}} good, Mrs. Renshaw. I must have lost over a stone weight since yesterday. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> sort of <b>thing</b> were {{to go on for}} a few weeks I should get into {{fighting}} condition. Now, are you both ready? Lift." ...|$|R
5000|$|So, my brother, <b>if</b> the <b>things</b> <b>this</b> world {{gave you}} Leave hungers that won't pass away, My blessed Lord {{will come and}} save you, If you kneel to Him and humbly pray: ...|$|R
6000|$|He went out, and Eleanor {{turned to}} her brother. [...] "I am afraid Charley {{is going to be}} sorry I promised to marry him," [...] she said. [...] "Still, I think I am fond of him, or I might have been, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> horrible <b>thing</b> hadn't come between us.
