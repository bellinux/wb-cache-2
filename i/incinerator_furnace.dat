The combustion residues and combustion aerosol (particulate matter and gas phase) collected downstream of the <b>incinerator</b> <b>furnace</b> were characterized using various aerosol analysis techniques. Time tracking of the gas and particle-number concentrations revealed two-step char formation during combustion.

40|$|International audienceEnd-of-life nanocomposites {{are likely}} to undergo {{disposal}} through thermal treatment like incineration. Data from literature indicate that nanocomposites present specific behaviours according to the conditions of thermal treatment [1]. It is thus relevant to understand the mechanisms of emission and thermal degradation of nanocomposites under incineration conditions. Thence, the characterization of the effluents during the incineration of nanocomposites, collected downstream the <b>incinerator</b> <b>furnace</b> (or even upstream the flue-gas cleaning systems), provides an insight in the "nanosafety" of this technology [2], useful to cope with nanowastes (wastes containing nanomaterials). At a lab-scale, the emission mechanisms and the thermal degradation mechanisms were determined using various devices: a microcalorimeter PCFC and a fire propagation apparatus (FPA Tewarson) coupled with a Fourier Transformed InfraRed (FTIR); {{as well as a}} modified tubular furnace (Fig. 1) coupled with a gas analyser. Conditions of thermal degradation implemented in those laboratory devices were accurately characterized by evaluating and controlling (whenever possible) the key operational parameters that govern an incineration process, i. e. chiefly: temperature, residence time, air-excess and turbulence. Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI) coupled with combustion devices and the morphology was determined using TEM observation (transmission electronic microscopy) via a MPS (mini-particle-sampler) [3]. Our tests were performed on specimens of nanocomposites incorporating different mineral fillers (like sepiolite and halloysite nanoclays) and neat polymer matrices. The characterization of the combustion aerosols from the small-scale thermal degradation of nanocomposites is a first step for determining nano- objects potentially released during incineration process...|$|E

Additional information: This facility is burning combustible rubbish (no household garbage) consisting of wood, paper products and brush. The rubbish can be identified by the loads on the trucks that are lined up to deliver their loads to the plant. There was a raised concrete drive, or loading road, which ran between the two plant buildings. The trucks would drive in between the two plant buildings, dump their loads onto the charging floor where the rubbish is then would be fed to the <b>incinerator</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The plant could be using heat to generate steam to run force draft blowers to ensure the complete combustion of the rubbish. The <b>incinerator</b> <b>furnaces</b> are below the loading floor, thus the need to raise the road between the two buildings as the furnaces are only partially below grade.

40|$|Rowan Technologies Ltd, a UK based company, has {{recently}} developed {{a range of}} scanner systems for monitoring corrosion/erosion and thermal behaviour over small or large areas of plant. Data can be presented {{in the form of}} multi-dimensional plots. The systems are non-intrusive, using electrodes connected externally to the plant, and are maintenance-free at the monitoring location, allowing lifetime monitoring in potentially inaccessible areas. The corrosion/erosion aspect of the system has evolved from the well-established electrical resistance technique for monitoring corrosion where thinning of a metal increases its measured electrical resistance. However, this measured resistance is also temperature dependent and the system has the ability to simultaneously measure temperatures and resistances to a high degree of accuracy, allowing this temperature dependency to be effectively nulled out (1). Corrosion, remaining thickness and time-to-replacement maps can be produced at intervals of a few weeks, depending upon the application. The scanner has a range of applications, for example: boilers, <b>incinerators,</b> <b>furnaces,</b> storage tanks, pipelines and other industrial plant.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of municipal waste as a fuel is marked mainly by its hetero-geneous composition and relatively poor heating value. Two solutions {{have been proposed}} for its combustion, namely, in the form {{in which it is}} delivered, or after some type of preparation.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste (particularly of municipal solid waste) that cannot be minimized, recycled or reused presents a huge international problem. The last 20 years {{is characterized by a}} gradual transition from landfilling of the municipal solid waste (MSW) to incineration. The incineration of MSW under existing legislation and operational boundary conditions is a very complex process with the application of two-stage combustion, minimization of emissions and production of energy (generally heat and electricity). In MSW incinerators, the first stage consists of combustion of heterogeneous waste on a moving grate that transports and mixes the waste during the combustion process. The grate combustion process involves drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and char burn-out. Thus, gasification and pyrolysis are subsets of the combustion problem. Mathematical modeling of combustion on the grate requires the solution of the flow field and concentrations of gaseous species in a reacting and moving bed, taking into account various heat transfer mechanisms. Development of an accurate mathematical model of the incineration process is limited by the lack of measured data for validation. Requirements for specific (in-situ) data essential for the development of an incinerator burning bed model and {{a better understanding of the}} grate combustion process prompted accurate measurement of concentrations of selected gases within a moving, burning bed of solid waste. For this purpose we have designed and developed a special cube-capsule with insulating refractory ceramic fibres and materials with cooling effects enabling measurements of CO and temperature by an electrochemical sensor, small gas pump and electronics placed inside. This unique self-contained and mechanically/thermally protected probe consisting of measuring and recording electronic components was able to withstand temperatures over 1000 °C for a period longer than two hours. The measurement technique differs from all conventional methods of measurements in that the capsule (casket) can be introduced into the incinerator together with the waste and hence experiences the same conditions on the grate as the waste material. This novel device proved to be convenient for in-situ measurements in moving grate incineration. The capsule with sensor for CO measurement passed through three <b>incinerator</b> <b>furnaces</b> burning MSW and recorded CO concentration and two temperatures on opposing sides of the capsule, saving all data onto a computer memory chip. The cube-capsule was recovered from the incinerator ash pit and the recorded information was downloaded onto an Excel spreadsheet for subsequent analysis. A similar capsule/casket being designed with thermal insulation/cooling could be used for simultaneous measurement of CO, oxygen, CO 2 (or pollutants as HCl) and temperatures to characterize the combustion process of waste. A vibration sensor, detection of casket position on the grate and measurement of temperatures and intake of gas samples from more surface positions will further improve the record of the trajectory/rolling of the capsule, to elucidate the effects of horizontal and vertical distance on the grate within the furnace and the overall history (residence time in various sections) experienced on the grate by waste.

The dioxin-like PCB fingerprints of the waste inputs show that PCB oils Aroclor 1242 and Aroclor 1254 late are the major dioxin-like PCB contamination source of sludge, RDF and ASR. The dioxin-like PCB fingerprints of the waste inputs are clearly different from the fingerprints of the outputs i. e. boiler and fly ash, indicating that in full scale waste incinerators dioxin-like PCBs in the input waste are destroyed and other dioxin-like PCBs are newly formed in the post combustion zone. The dioxin-like PCB fingerprint of boiler and fly ash of all three incinerators corresponds well to the fly ash fingerprint obtained in lab scale de novo synthesis experiments, indicating that dioxin-like PCBs are mainly formed through this mechanism.
