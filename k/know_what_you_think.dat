500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of Bryan's message, Hanna was convinced the Democrat's support would recede. [...] "He's talking Silver all the time, and that's where we've got him", Hanna stated, pounding his desk, in July. [...] He proved correct; the silver enthusiasm waned by September and Bryan had no ready replacement for it. [...] McKinley, {{on the other}} hand, convinced that his [...] "sound money" [...] campaign had worked, began to promote his tariff issue, stating to the crowds on his front lawn, [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, but I believe {{it is a good}} deal better to open the mills of the United States to the labor of America than to open the mints of the United States to the silver of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Hello, all you Cyberheads! Welcome to the 90's {{version of}} intimacy. You can hear me... You can even see me... But you can't touch me... do you {{recognize}} my voice?... It's Madonna. Often imitated, but never duplicated. Or, should I say, often irritated? If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message and let me <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't realize is that the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then the worst--we haven't faced that. I {{could face}} it, I believe, if I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it. I feel," [...] he explained, [...] "as if I had lost {{my power to}} {{conceive}} such things." [...] And {{he wondered if he}} looked as blank as he sounded. [...] "It's spent." ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I don't want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>think,</b> I {{want the}} fact.|$|R
60|$|FANNY. Quite ready, dear. Of course--I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> of them--but I've only brought modern costumes with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess not, pap. I'd like to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're a-doin' sendin' me 'way back there. Boomtown's {{good enough}} fer me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I--er--I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> And if you {{try this}} bronco-busting business, why--I'll try it too, so there!" [...] {{answered}} Phil, defiantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Briscoe, this is {{a horrible}} mess," [...] Lord St. Maurice {{declared}} emphatically. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of duels; I hate them." ...|$|E
60|$|LOUIS. Yes, <b>you</b> have. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> all <b>think</b> of me. Dont imagine I'm sore about it. I forgive you.|$|R

6000|$|... "But my father--what {{became of}} him? They took him {{away to the}} East, {{and that is all}} I ever <b>knew.</b> <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> became of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me!" [...] she cried. [...] "There's {{something}} more; there's {{another chance}} for me. I must, and will, <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See, such {{a parcel}} of reading books. I want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of setting {{them up with}} 'Jane Sparks', as it is week-day teaching." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Dick-- and I {{think the}} same-- that {{that man was}} the one who aided Crabtree to escape from jail," [...] said Sam.|$|E
6000|$|... "At last I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> of me. I {{have read}} what Miserrimus Dexter promised I should read--the {{confession}} of your loathing for me, {{in your own}} handwriting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Smithers," [...] he went on--"Miss Augusta, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> of me, but I {{must tell}} you, I can't keep it any longer, I love you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{friendship}} remains {{just the}} same, Richard. Let me <b>know</b> frankly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of this campaign, {{since you have}} now suddenly turned the current of the conversation in that direction?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it; you've {{sufficiently}} hinted {{how little}} that is. But it's precisely because you {{regard it as}} rubbish that I now appeal to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I want to {{talk with}} you. She's out, with Lottie; and when she comes back I will tell her what you say. But I want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> first." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about anniversaries. I like them, being always minded {{to drink}} my cup {{of life to}} the bottom, and take my chance of the sweets and bitters.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think,</b> or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{may have}} thought sometimes. Perhaps you have often thought the same. Doady, dear, I am afraid I was too young.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Men {{are always}} selfish, I <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Plantagenet lately?" [...] The {{question}} was put very abruptly, without a moment's notice, {{and there was}} no avoiding it.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{an awkward}} pause after his departure. [...] "I’m sure I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> must <b>think</b> of me," [...] said the mate at length, [...] "but I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> your father’s talking about." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> father," [...] he said. [...] "You and I are {{agreed on}} that point now. I admit that {{what appears to be}} evil may be made to work for good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do you? Then now I shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Augustus. We {{think he}} is very clever; but I do not know any man who makes himself more popular with young ladies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> of me {{for taking}} this for granted, Mr. Vane," [...] {{she said as}} he took his seat beside her, [...] "but I couldn't resist the chance of driving behind your horse." ...|$|R

6000|$|If {{we could}} get Mary Boyle, we would do [...] "Used Up," [...] which is a {{delightful}} piece, as the farce. But maybe you know nothing about the said Mary, {{and in that case}} I should like to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> of doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] cried Johnson, {{clutching}} at his thick frieze overcoat. [...] "We are {{so glad that}} you have come. And, doctor, please come down soon and let me <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} to you of my brother-in-law," [...] she said. [...] "He has told me of your visit; and I am anxious to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of him. Do you like Mr. John Zant?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "and I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do <b>think</b> of it, but indeed {{you need}} not be wasted. Our women and {{children}} want so much done for them, and none of our ladies are able or willing. Will you not come and help me?" ...|$|R
