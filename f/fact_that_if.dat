Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> convicted, he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E

5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's Automatic Picture Transmission based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

25|$|This axiomatization is complete, {{meaning that}} every Boolean law s= t is provable in this system. One first shows by {{induction}} on {{the height of}} s that every Boolean law for which t is atomic is provable, using R1 for the base case (since distinct atoms are never equal) and A1 and R3 for the induction step (s an application). This proof strategy amounts to a recursive procedure for evaluating s to yield an atom. Then to prove s= t in the general case when t may be an application, use the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> s= t is an identity then s and t must evaluate to the same atom, call it u.

25|$|Because of his {{philosophical}} beliefs, René Descartes {{proposed in}} 1644 that no empty space can exist and that space must consequently {{be filled with}} matter. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with vortices. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to centrifugal force, matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater inertia—so due to {{the pressure of the}} condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed {{into the center of the}} vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing else than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent close {{co-operation}} between {{indigenous people}} and Z Force units makes the operation went smoothly as most Allied forces had been received warmly {{especially when they}} showing respect towards {{the tradition of the}} tribes. The fact was supported when another Liberator owned by the United States Air Force (USAF) was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft gun in Borneo, its crew members are rescued and hidden from the Japanese despite knowing the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Japanese discovering their acts, the entire tribes will be executed. Most of the Allied activities are conducted under two notable intelligence and guerrilla warfare operations towards the passage of liberation, namely Operation Agas for North Borneo and Operation Semut for Sarawak with some notable commando members including F. G. L. Chester, G. S. Carter, Jack Wong Sue, Jock McLaren and Roland Griffiths-Marsh. The Semut parties tried to gain intelligence about Japanese concentrations on the Brunei Bay to facilitate the landings of Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for the liberation mission in June 1945. Through these intelligence operations, almost 50% of Allied planes flying over Borneo had been shot down as Japanese fighter aircraft patrolled the sky throughout the day in addition for being crashed caused by unpredictable weather in the highlands and possibility of mechanical problems on a long day flight.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E
