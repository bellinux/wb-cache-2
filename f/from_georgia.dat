5|$|The NATO-Russia Council {{meeting was}} mostly {{noted by the}} absence of both Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin and of any progress concerning the ratification of the adapted CFE treaty or the withdrawal of Russian troops <b>from</b> <b>Georgia</b> and Moldova.

5|$|This {{situation}} was mirrored in Abkhazia, an autonomous republic in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where the Abkhaz seceded <b>from</b> <b>Georgia</b> {{during the war}} in the early 1990s. The population of Abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an ethnic cleansing of Georgians, the single largest ethnic group in the region, a decrease from 525,000 before the war. The upper Kodori Gorge (in northeast Abkhazia) remained beyond the unrecognised Abkhaz separatist government's control.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005 season, an NCAA {{investigation}} found that eleven ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule.

Twelve football scholarships were stricken <b>from</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech Athletic Department appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director.|$|E

Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren.

5|$|Gold strikes {{from the}} mid-19th to early 20thcenturies {{played a major}} role in {{attracting}} settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers <b>from</b> <b>Georgia</b> discovered gold along the Blue River in Colorado and established the mining boomtown of Breckenridge. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the Uncompahgre and San Miguel rivers, also in Colorado, and these led to the creation of Ouray and Telluride, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in lode deposits, extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional streams and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree <b>from</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech.

He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able to be productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia <b>from</b> <b>Georgia,</b> USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
