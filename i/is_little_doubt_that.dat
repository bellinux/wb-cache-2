From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement, their presence on the island is confirmed by the many features they named.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived {{in the area where}} they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|Earl Henry was {{not present}} at the battle, but there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> he participated in the rebellion. After a short imprisonment, he was pardoned, and in June 1404 he {{delivered}} his grandson into the king's custody at Doncaster. By May 1405, however, the earl was involved in another rebellion. His plans failed, and {{he was forced to}} flee to Scotland, taking his grandson with him. The following years were marked by an itinerant life and further plotting, while the young Henry remained in the custody of the Duke of Albany. On 19 February 1408, the first earl of Northumberland was killed in the Battle of Bramham Moor, leaving the young Henry Percy as heir apparent to the earldom. Henry remained in Scotland until the accession of Henry V in 1413, when he tried to claim his grandfather's title. His cause was aided by the king's aunt, Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, who arranged his marriage to her daughter Eleanor. It was in Henry V's interest to reconcile with the Percys, with their vast network in the north of England; in 1416 Henry Percy was created Earl of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

25|$|Even though Gadamer's {{interpretation}} of Heidegger has been questioned, there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, {{not merely a}} series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> {{the history}} of {{transport}} communications through Harringay {{had a significant effect}} on its shape today. In Roman times, a great roadway through the area to the north was established. This roadway endured as a great communication passage to the north and brought much activity through the heart of the area. It also acted as the rough dividing line for land ownership, identifying Harringay’s position on the edge of manorial and subsequently borough boundaries.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{reliable}} worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities.

There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> competence, good preparation and appropriate equipment reduce the risk of all hazardous activities.|$|E
25|$|These {{delays and}} the lack of funding slowed the project. In Germany, Hans von Ohain had started work on a {{prototype}} in 1935, and had by this point passed the prototype stage and was building the world's first flyable Jet aircraft, the Heinkel HeS 3. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Whittle's efforts would have been at the same level or even more advanced had the Air Ministry taken a greater interest in the design. When war broke out in September 1939, Power Jets had a payroll of only 10 and Griffith's operations at the RAE and Metropolitan-Vickers were similarly small.|$|E
25|$|However, {{collaboration}} {{is not the}} whole story. While there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> there were strong antisemitic feelings in Belgium, after November 1942, the German roundups became less successful as large-scale rescue operations were carried out by ordinary Belgians. This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry {{out some of the}} Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, who were there {{at the start of the}} war, survived the Final Solution.|$|E

25|$|Van Voorst {{states that}} {{although}} {{the question of who}} was referred to in various points in the Talmud remains subject to debate among scholars, in the case of Sanhedrin 43a (generally considered the most important reference to Jesus in rabbinic literature), Jesus can be confirmed as the subject of the passage, not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it, and there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> it refers to the death of Jesus of Nazareth. Christopher M. Tuckett states that if it is accepted that death narrative of Sanhedrin 43a refers to Jesus of Nazareth then it provides evidence of Jesus' existence and execution.|$|E
25|$|After just 100 {{hours of}} ground combat, {{and with all}} of Kuwait and much of {{southern}} Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; there <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing Hussein would have broadened {{the scope of the}} conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.|$|E
25|$|It should however {{be noted}} that the {{disadvantages}} of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the hilly, heavily wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armoured units. However, precisely because the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the Wehrmacht. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.|$|E

25|$|The trial {{documents}} show that many individuals were {{implicated in the}} plot. Chief among them were Queen Tiye and her son Pentaweret, Ramesses' chief of the chamber, Pebekkamen, seven royal butlers (a respectable state office), two Treasury overseers, two Army standard bearers, two royal scribes and a herald. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> all of the main conspirators were executed: some of the condemned were given the option of committing suicide (possibly by poison) rather than being put to death. According to the surviving trial transcripts, {{a total of three}} separate trials were started, while 38 people were sentenced to death. The tombs of Tiye and her son Pentaweret were robbed and their names erased to prevent them from enjoying an afterlife. The Egyptians did such a thorough job of this that the only references to them are the trial documents and what remains of their tombs.|$|E
25|$|There are few records {{mentioning}} girls {{or women}} working to drive cattle up the cattle trails of the Old West. However women did considerable ranch work, {{and in some}} cases (especially when the men went to war or on long cattle drives) ran them. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> women, particularly the wives and daughters of men who owned small ranches and could not afford to hire large numbers of outside laborers, worked side by side with men and thus needed to ride horses and be able to perform related tasks. The largely undocumented contributions of women to the west were acknowledged in law; the western states led the United States in granting women the right to vote, beginning with Wyoming in 1869. Early photographers such as Evelyn Cameron documented the life of working ranch women and cowgirls during the late 19th and early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, lifestyle- and obesity-related {{diseases}} {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent all around the world. There <b>is</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the increasingly widespread application of some modern food processing technologies has contributed to this development. The food processing industry is {{a major part of}} modern economy, and as such it is influential in political decisions (e.g., nutritional recommendations, agricultural subsidising). In any known profit-driven economy, health considerations are hardly a priority; effective production of cheap foods with a long shelf-life is more the trend. In general, whole, fresh foods have a relatively short shelf-life and are less profitable to produce and sell than are more processed foods. Thus, the consumer is left with the choice between more expensive, but nutritionally superior, whole, fresh foods, and cheap, usually nutritionally inferior, processed foods. Because processed foods are often cheaper, more convenient (in both purchasing, storage, and preparation), and more available, the consumption of nutritionally inferior foods has been increasing throughout the world along with many nutrition-related health complications.|$|E
50|$|There can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Christie {{used the}} real-life tragedy of American actress Gene Tierney {{as the basis}} of her plot.
