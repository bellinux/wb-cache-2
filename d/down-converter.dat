The lowest frequency ham band suitable for television transmission is 70 centimeters, which is between broadcast channels 13 and 14.

[...] As such, ATV transmissions can be viewed by setting a television or analog cable-box to cable input and attaching an outdoor antenna.

The down-conversion efficiency of europium and samarium is optimized for solar cells. An {{improvement of the}} quantum efficiency of the cells is demonstrated in the spectral region where the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells is low. For silicon-based solar cells, improvement of the quantum efficiency is achieved by europium (Eu) ions. As the quantum efficiency of the silicon is high even at wavelengths below 400 nm the gain by the enhanced EQE in the UV is spoiled by extra absorption from the glass.

5000|$|In a {{satellite}} communications system, the ground station receiving antenna connect to an LNA because the received signal is weak. The received signal {{is usually a}} little above background noise since satellites have limited power and use low power transmitters. The satellites are also distant and suffer path loss: low earth orbit satellites might be 200 km (120 miles) away; a geosynchronous satellite is [...] away. A larger ground antenna would give a stronger signal, but a larger antenna can be more expensive than adding an LNA. The LNA boosts the antenna signal {{to compensate for the}} feed line losses between the (outdoor) antenna and the (indoor) receiver. In many satellite reception systems, the LNA includes a frequency block <b>down-converter</b> that shifts the satellite downlink frequency (e.g., 11 GHz) that would have large feed line losses to a lower frequency (e.g., 1 GHz) with lower losses. The LNA with down converter is called a low-noise block <b>down-converter</b> (LNB). Satellite communications are usually done in the frequency range of 100 MHz (e.g. TIROS weather satellites) to tens of GHz (e.g., satellite television).|$|E
50|$|In {{digital signal}} processing, a digital <b>down-converter</b> (DDC) {{converts}} a digitized, band limited signal {{to a lower}} frequency signal at a lower sampling rate {{in order to simplify}} the subsequent radio stages. The process preserves all the information in the original signal less that which is lost to rounding errors in the mathematical processes. The input and output signals can be real or complex samples. Often the DDC converts from the raw radio frequency or intermediate frequency down to a complex baseband signal.|$|E
50|$|The {{output stages}} of both devices are similar, but the input stages are quite different. There is no {{baseband}} audio or video input to the translator. The translator receives an over-the air RF input signal {{by means of}} an antenna, just like a home receiver. Since received signal is already modulated {{there is no need for}} a modulator. Instead an input mixer or <b>down-converter</b> shifts the radio-frequency (RF) signal down to an intermediate-frequency (IF) signal. A second mixer (known as output mixer or up-converter) shifts the IF signal back up to the FM or TV band output signal frequency.|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of photon pairs {{is useful for}} {{a broad range of}} applications, from the fundamental (exclusion of hidden-variable formulations of quantum mechanics) to the more practical (quantum cryptography and quantum computation). A key parameter determining the usefulness of a particular source is its brightness, i. e., how many photon pairs per second are generated into a particular electromagnetic mode and frequency bandwidth. Parametric <b>down-converters</b> based on nonlinear crystals are excellent sources of photon pairs, but typically have large bandwidths of hundreds of GHz. However, new applications are emerging that demand large pair-generation rates into the narrow bandwidths (5 MHz) suitable for strong interaction of the photons with atoms and molecules. We have developed an atomic-ensemble source of photon pairs with spectral brightness near fundamental physical limitations and approximately three orders of magnitude greater than the best current devices based on nonlinear crystals.

50|$|The basic {{arrangement}} of the radio receiver used an antenna feeding an amplifier and <b>down-converter</b> (see Frequency mixer) feeding an automatic gain control, which fed an {{analog to digital converter}} that was on a computer VMEbus with a lot of digital signal processors (Texas Instruments C40s). The transmitter had digital to analog converters on the PCI bus feeding an up converter (mixer) that led to a power amplifier and antenna.
