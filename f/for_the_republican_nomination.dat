He suspended his campaign on February 3, 2016, {{shortly after the}} Iowa caucus, where he finished in 5th place out of the 12 Republican candidates.|$|E
5|$|Green {{first entered}} public {{service as a}} special deputy {{commonwealth}} attorney general from 1954 to 1955. He was assigned as counsel for the Director of the Bureau of Workman's Compensation. In addition to representing the Director, Green was also responsible for approving all claims for compensation under the occupational disease statute whenever the Commonwealth was involved. In 1954 Green unsuccessfully ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> for Philadelphia City Council.|$|E
5|$|In response, Gingrich {{stated that}} he had not quit the race <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination,</b> and pointed to his {{experience}} running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a Republican majority in the house and working for decades to build a Republican majority in Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich's resilience throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, David F. Tufaro, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} and lawyer from Roland Park, Maryland, announced his intention to run for the Republican Party nomination, joining three neighborhood activists who had already declared their intentions to run. Carl Adair, a public school teacher who had run unsuccessfully for the City Council and the Maryland House of Delegates on numerous occasions, was also a candidate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radio {{personality}} Janet Jeghelian took {{an early}} lead in polls among candidates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> for the Senate seat, but Romney proved {{the most effective}} fundraiser. He won 68percent of the vote at the May 1994 Massachusetts Republican Party convention; businessman John Lakian finished a distant second, eliminating Jeghelian. Romney defeated Lakian in the September 1994 primary with more than 80percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge was unopposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and {{his running}} mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, {{ran on the}} {{previous}} administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected {{by a margin of}} 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.|$|E

5|$|In the 1908 presidential election, Bradley {{supported}} Charles W. Fairbanks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination,</b> while Willson favored William Howard Taft. Disharmony marred {{the state}} nominating convention, and despite being a newly minted senator, Bradley was not chosen as a {{delegate to the}} Republican National Convention. This infuriated Bradley and ended his alliance with Willson. In the 1911 Republican nominating convention, Bradley did not support Edward C. O'Rear, the party's eventual gubernatorial nominee. He did little to support O'Rear in the general election, and former governor James B. McCreary was elected.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, 2009, Bunning {{announced}} that he would not run for reelection in the face of insufficient fundraising. The announcement left only Paul and Secretary of State Trey Grayson as the remaining candidates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination,</b> with Paul announcing on August 5, 2009, that he would officially run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican. The announcement was made through a series of national TV events, radio, and other programs, as well as newspapers in Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2008, Paul finally {{withdrew his}} bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b> He later {{said that one}} of the reasons he did not run in the general {{election}} as a third-party candidate, after losing the primaries, was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary. Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the new political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.|$|E

50|$|Putting {{himself at}} odds with the more {{conservative}} factions that controlled <b>the</b> Iowa <b>Republican</b> Party in <b>the</b> decade {{after the end of the}} war, Hoegh became an active supporter of Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen in his bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1948 <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> president, and former General Dwight Eisenhower in his bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1952 <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> <b>for</b> president.|$|R

5|$|State Senator Chris Lauzen, Geneva mayor Kevin Burns, {{and dairy}} {{businessman}} Jim Oberweis all entered the campaign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> to succeed Hastert. In December 2007, Hastert endorsed Oberweis in the primary, and Burns {{withdrew from the}} race. In the February 2008 primary election, Oberweis was elected as the Republican nominee, and Fermilab scientist Bill Foster was elected as the Democratic nominee. In the special election in March 2008 to fill the rest of Hastert's unexpired term, Foster defeated Oberweis. In a rematch in the November 2008 elections for a full two-year term, Foster again defeated Oberweis.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Tommy Thompson, 42nd Governor of Wisconsin and Secretary of Health and Human Services {{began when he}} announced his candidacy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> {{for president of the}} United States on April 1, 2007. Thompson centered his campaign in Iowa, focusing primarily on the issues of health care reform and the War in Iraq. He dropped out of the race on August 12, 2007 following a sixth-place finish in the Ames straw poll and went on to endorse Rudy Giuliani for president and then John McCain following Giuliani's withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b> The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed the Democratic candidate, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E

5|$|With most Progressives having {{rejoined the}} Republican Party, their former leader, Theodore Roosevelt, was deemed {{likely to make}} a third run for the White House in 1920, and was the {{overwhelming}} favorite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b> These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6, 1919. A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, {{and a host of}} relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, and General John J. Pershing.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Willkie {{made two}} wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt's {{informal}} envoy, and as nominal {{leader of the}} Republican Party gave the president his full support. This angered many conservatives, especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes. Willkie ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> in 1944, but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April. He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming, after the war, a liberal political party, but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit. Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt vital political assistance in 1940, which allowed the president to aid Britain in its time of crisis.|$|E
5|$|Elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Romney {{helped develop}} and then {{signed into law}} the Massachusetts health care reform legislation, {{the first of its}} kind in the nation. It {{provided}} near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and individual mandates to purchase insurance. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and closing corporate tax loopholes. He did not seek re-election in 2006, instead focusing on his campaign <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination</b> in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Though he won several primaries and caucuses, the eventual nominee was Senator John McCain. Romney's considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190–250million, helped finance his political campaigns prior to 2012.|$|E

5|$|For both offices, the Republicans {{nominated}} regulars. The incumbent treasurer, Francis D. Pastorius, defeated William M. Paschall and Gibson, with 71,364 to Pastorius, 41,244 to Paschall, and 10,464 to Gibson. The Democrats nominated Joseph F. Vogt without opposition, {{though he}} had died in April, {{a month before the}} May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on the ballot.) In September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a similar pattern. The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E. Costello <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b> The Democrats renominated the incumbent, Joseph Ominsky, over challenger Gust G. Tatlas.|$|E
5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 delegates to the Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>nomination.</b> On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>{{nomination}}</b> for President in 2000, but {{he lost a}} heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, {{he had become a}} key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E
