5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves did not <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> {{that he asked}} for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E
25|$|It took Alexander {{three days}} to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> ready for the general assault {{that was about to}} take place against the city. When things were finally ready, Alexander divided his force into three parts. The first part of the force he ordered to attack the palisades that were around the city itself.

It {{was a matter of}} how do we <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> in to one song?" [...] All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon, and instead of taking turns, the five members went inside the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together.

Space Station Silicon Valley entered beta in August 1998, and was first released for Nintendo 64 on 21 October 1998. Baglow attributed the lengthy development cycle to {{the scale of the}} game, stating that [...] "it's got to be fun". A Game Boy Color version of the game—a 2D remake of the original version—was released in Europe in late 1999; IGN's Tim Jones was critical of the port, criticising the gameplay and level design. The game was also ported to the PlayStation by Runecraft in June 2000, under the title Evo's Space Adventures, although the original development team had little input besides providing the models, codes and textures; a review by [...] criticised the port's poor gameplay and graphics, and it has elsewhere been described as [...] "one of the laziest ports in the history of video games".|$|E

500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E

Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> [...] could in there.

500|$|After {{signing the}} group, Virgin Records {{launched}} a major campaign for their debut song to promote {{them as the}} new high-profile act. There {{was a period of}} indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be [...] "Wannabe", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be [...] "Say You'll Be There", which they considered a much [...] "cooler" [...] track, or [...] "Love Thing". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that [...] "Wannabe" [...] should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell was shocked and furious; she told Fuller, [...] "It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single." [...] Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.|$|E
500|$|For recording, the Doors hired Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff {{and rhythm}} guitarist Marc Benno {{to round out}} their sound, with Scheff, in particular, {{contributing}} on every track except [...] "L'America". Densmore characterized Scheff as [...] "an in-the-pocket man" [...] and praised how he [...] "allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast". By all accounts, Morrison– a huge Presley fan– was excited by Scheff's participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate {{as a result of}} his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as [...] "blues day", recording [...] "Crawling King Snake", [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window", and [...] "L.A. Woman". The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, [...] "The overall concept for the recording session was to go back to our early roots and try to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible". Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris, France.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

Later, at Grizz's wedding, Jack tells Liz that Carol is looking for her. Carol tells Liz that he would like to give her a chance so that the two can have a relationship.

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to <b>get</b> <b>everything</b> right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
