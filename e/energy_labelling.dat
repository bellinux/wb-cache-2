40|$|A {{proposal}} for <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated display cabinets was {{submitted to the}} European Commission in November 1995. However, as the priorities in European <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> schemes are focused on electric appliances for the consumer market, a directive for compulsory <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> of refrigerated cabinets has not been prepared. Stil!, an <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> scheme for refrigerated display cases is being used throughout Europe. The driving force is a subsidy on energy efficient display cases provided by Dutch energy distribution companies - together with an tax deduction possibility for investments in energy efficient refrigerated display cases in The Netherlands. "Energy efficient display cases" are defined as display cases with an "A" or "B" energy efficiency class (energy consumption of more than 45 % below market average for class A or between 25 % and 45 % below market average for class B). The determination of energy efficiency {{is based on the}} original <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> proposal, which has been revised as of January 1998 on the basis of amendments made by the European committee of air handling, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment manufacturers.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> {{at point}} of {{purchase}} is gaining traction worldwide, yet the potential impact for different socioeconomic groups is unclear. We aimed to summarise evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> by socioeconomic position (SEP). METHODS: A systematic search for papers published to September 2015 was conducted using terms for labelling, food outlets, and SEP. Quality of studies was assessed. Results were summarised across stages of an intervention logic pathway. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were identified. Of twelve studies reporting the effect of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> in low SEP populations, six reported on purchase outcomes. All but one of these reported no positive effect of the policy for this population. Two of the five studies that compared purchase outcomes of menu labelling across SEP groups reported that the policy was effective overall. These two studies reported either a significant decline in fast food calories purchased from consumers in high (but not low) SEP neighbourhoods or a significantly greater decline in calories purchased among consumers visiting stores in higher SEP neighbourhoods post policy implementation. Few studies were rated as moderate to high quality. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence describing the impact of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> within or across SEP is limited in quantity and quality. Of the two studies that reported a positive benefit of menu <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> overall, both identified a greater effect on fast food purchases among consumers visiting stores in high compared to low SEP neighbourhoods. It is difficult to know whether the absence of effectiveness reported in low SEP populations represents a true lack of effectiveness or is a result of a more general lack of policy effectiveness or the limited quality of the reviewed studies...|$|E

40|$|Energy for his {{comments}} and suggestions during {{the preparation of this}} paper. This paper represents the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the Department of Primary Industries & Energy. Household appliance penetration and ownership in Australia is higher than in western Europe, and close to North American levels. Most products are manufactured locally, by firms with international links and with access to both European and North American designs and technology. A significant share of the market is imported, mainly from New Zealand, Asia and Europe. Because of the relative mildness of the climate, appliances that carry an energy label (such as dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers and refrigerators & freezers) account for a greater share of household energy use than in most other developed countries. The energy efficiency of appliances in Australia increased steadily during the early 1980 's, but the introduction of mandatory <b>energy</b> <b>labelling</b> in 1986 in some states saw {{a significant increase in the}} rate of change.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that informed consumers make better purchasing decisions. This principle is applied through the European <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> to promote more energy-efficient appliances. The <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> {{has been quite}} a success story, with over 80 % of consumers recognising it. Many consumers also indicate that they understand the <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> and use it for their purchase decisions. Despite the positive results, data show that the absolute energy consumption in households have increased {{in recent years and}} that despite improvements in overall product efficiency, absolute power consumption of some products has increased. Compounding this problem, studies have shown that consumers do not understand all elements of the various <b>energy</b> <b>labels.</b> Thus, better media are needed to improve communication and positively influence these important consumer choices. Digital labelling tools are one of the best solutions for overcoming these problems. This paper presents research into the consumer perceptions of a digital <b>energy</b> <b>label</b> as an add-on to the EU <b>energy</b> <b>label.</b> Besides offering more information, one major advantage of the digital concept is that it’s designed as a point of sale tool. Thus consumers would be able to access relevant information during the actual purchase decision. The paper presents the objectives, methodology and detailed findings of spontaneous consumer reactions to this digital concept at two consumer focus groups conducted in Germany and Spain with 22 participants many of whom had recently bought an appliance. The workshops included questionnaires and group discussions, as well as an outline concept of the digital tool. Outputs were transcribed and analysed using qualitative and statistical methods. Findings are then applied to develop the digital tool to better inform consumers {{in the context of a}} purchase decision as this work was conducted under the DigiLabel project, aiming at ensuring a better informed decision and more energy-efficient outcome...|$|R
