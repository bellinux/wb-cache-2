50|$|Packard's {{successful}} {{development of}} its own automatic transmission was unique; no other independent (non-Big Three) automaker managed such a feat. The company's worsening situation throughout the 1950s, however, did not permit sufficient funds {{to keep up with}} the transmission development of the larger companies; Packard's attempts to update the Ultramatic were not sufficiently tested to iron out the problems, and those problems did damage to the company's reputation. Some automotive historians have argued that Packard should have dropped the Ultramatic after 1954, and purchased a more modern transmission design from another manufacturer but such opinions prove worthless when considering Packard's use of a locking torque converter was not only up to date but ahead of its time. In addition, the only true new modern transmission to appear was the Dual Coupling Hydra-Matic but that did not appear until 1956 and had serious teething problems {{of its own}}. In retrospect Packard's Twin Ultramatic's most serious design flaw was during the low to high shift transition where a poorly timed <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> application and low band release over much of the allowable upshift range resulted in many premature <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> failures. This situation resulted in an unusual sensitivity to individual driving habits determining useful clutch life. Therefore, while this transmission was certainly designed to physically accept a high torque V8, its control system likely needed another year of development.|$|E
40|$|Polyembryony, {{referring}} here {{to situations}} where a nucellar embryo is formed {{along with the}} zygotic embryo, has different consequences for the fitness of the maternal parent and offspring. We have developed genetic and inclusive fitness models to derive the conditions that permit the evolution of polyembryony under maternal and offspring control. We have also derived expressions for the optimal allocation (evolutionarily stable strategy, ESS) of resources between zygotic and nucellar embryos. It is seen that (i) Polyembryony can evolve more easily under maternal control than under that of either the offspring or the ‘selfish’ endosperm. Under maternal regulation, evolution of polyembryony can occur for any clutch size. Under offspring control polyembryony {{is more likely to}} evolve for <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes, and is unlikely for low clutch sizes (< 3). This conflict between mother and offspring decreases with increase in clutch size and favours the evolution of polyembryony at <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes, (ii) Polyembryony can evolve for values of “x” (the power of the function relating fitness to seed resource) greater than 0. 5758; the possibility of its occurrence increases with “x”, indicating that a more efficient conversion of resource into fitness favours polyembryony. (iii) Under both maternal parent and offspring control, the evolution of polyembryony becomes increasingly unlikely as the level of inbreeding increases, (iv) The proportion of resources allocated to the nucellar embryo at ESS is always higher than that which maximizes the rate of spread of the allele against a non-polyembryonic allele. Finally we argue that polyembryony is a maternal counter strategy to compensate for the loss in her fitness due to brood reduction caused by sibling rivalry. We support this assertion by two empirical evidences: (a) the extent of polyembryony is positively correlated with brood reduction inCitrus, and (b) species exhibiting polyembryony are more often those that frequently exhibit brood reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies of lizards {{have shown}} that {{offspring}} size cannot be altered by manipulating clutch size in species with a <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> frequency. This raises {{a question of whether}} clutch frequency has a key role in influencing the offspring size-number trade-off in lizards. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test the hypothesis that females reproducing more frequently are less likely to tradeoff offspring size against offspring number, we applied the follicle ablation technique to female Eremias argus (Lacertidae) from Handan (HD) and Gonghe (GH), the two populations that differ in clutch frequency. Follicle ablation resulted in enlargement of egg size in GH females, but not in HD females. GH females switched from producing a larger number of smaller eggs in the first clutch to a smaller number of larger eggs in the second clutch; HD females showed a similar pattern of seasonal shifts in egg size, but kept clutch size constant between the first two clutches. Thus, the egg size-number trade-off was evident in GH females, but not in HD females. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As HD females (mean  = 3. 1 clutches per year) reproduce more frequently than do GH females (mean  = 1. 6 clutches per year), our data therefore validate the hypothesis tested. Our data also provide an inference that maximization of maternal fitness could be achieved in females by diverting a large enough, rather than a higher-than-usual, fraction of the available energy to individual offspring in a given reproductive episode...|$|E

The merits of the different {{overrunning clutch}} are analyzed by the design characteristic, reliability, weight, process of the manufacture and so on. In the end, the application and development of the <b>high</b> speed overrunning <b>clutch</b> are discussed according to the characteristics of the transmission system that have high reliability, long life and light weight. Function of the <b>High</b> Speed Overrunning <b>Clutch</b> in the Transmission System of the Helicopter The <b>high</b> speed overrunning <b>clutch</b> {{is one of the}} critical components. When the power system drives the rotor system, the <b>high</b> overrunning <b>clutch</b> is on engagement mode that the speed of the driven part always tries to be equal to that of the driver.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{breeding}} bioloev of Kentish Plovers (Cliaradrius alexandrinus) in Fuente de Piedra lake (southern Spain) in 1991 and 1992. Breeders showed sexual dimorphism in tarsal length and body mass; body mass decreased throughout the breeding season only in males. Laying dates spanned 88 days in 1991 and 110 in 1992. Eggs {{deposited in the}} late nesting season were larger {{than those in the}} begining of the season. Females incubated during daytime and males during the night. Apparent clutches of 1 - 2 eggs occurred mostly late in the nesting season and reflect a high incidence of partial prédation (recorded in 17 % of 288 2 - 3 egg clutches). Nest prédation increased {{in the course of the}} breeding season, and only 19 % of all clutches produced chicks. Variables measured for each nest site (nest cover, distances to water and to nearest neighbour) did not influence nest prédation. Kentish Plover pairs that lost clutches usually renested together, on average 11 - 24 days after loss of their previous clutch. The body masses of females were similar between first and subsequent replacement nestings. Biparental care of chicks lasted longer than in several other populations of Kentish Plovers. When the chicks were 15 - 20 days old one of the adults, usually the female, deserted the brood. Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica) preyed on chicks up to 16 days of age. Both sexes showed antipredator behaviours (alarm calls, mobbing). Possibly, the greater maternal protection of the brood at Fuente de Piedra compared to other breeding locations results from an interrelationship between high prédation pressure and type of predators, since mobbing of Gull-billed Terns by adult plovers was effective in deterring the terns. After deserting broods, some females mated to new males (sequential polyandry). Sequential polygyny was recorded in males that fledged chicks early enough for a subsequent nesting attempt. We propose that the duration of the breeding season and <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> failure rates constrained the frequency of sequential polygamy in our population. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|King rail (Rallus elegans) {{populations are}} {{experiencing}} long-term declines attributable to habitat loss. Sparse breeding populations in coastal areas {{may represent the}} last strongholds for this species, but climate change models predict these are at risk from extreme weather events, including rising temperatures and higher frequencies and intensities of storms, with associated risks of storm surge and flooding. A breeding population at Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in coastal North Carolina likely represents an important source population for the region. I investigated the effects of elevated temperatures and rising water on the nesting success of king rails at Mackay Island NWR, and whether they have evolved behavioral plasticity in nesting behavior to mitigate these threats. I further tested the alternative hypothesis that variation among parents in nesting effort {{may be related to}} individual differences in body condition. Clutch temperatures that exceed acceptable limits for embryo development may result in embryo mortality. I monitored clutch and ambient temperatures simultaneously using Thermochron iButtons, and I documented parental incubation behavior at king rail nests. Video recordings reveal parents adjust their incubation behavior in response to ambient temperatures, and shading their nest may allow king rails to maintain their clutches below lethal temperatures in hot conditions. However, king rails tend to take more frequent recesses of nest attendance at higher temperatures, exposing their eggs to adverse conditions for embryo development. Clutches that reached higher temperatures {{for longer periods of time}} tended to hatch fewer chicks. Additionally, seasonal variation in temperature exposed late season nests to hotter conditions. Parents begin incubating earlier and hatching became more asynchronous later in the breeding season. Although parents show plasticity in incubation behavior, hatching failure related to <b>high</b> <b>clutch</b> temperatures suggests king rails may be constrained in their ability to cope with high temperatures experienced on the nest. Coastal marsh breeders must also contend with water level variation, and other rails (Family: Rallidae) add material to their nests throughout incubation to prevent nest flooding. Water levels at Mackay Island NWR are influenced by wind-driven tides and, consequently, are exceptionally variable. King rails build taller nests in areas with greater ranges in water levels. Parents spent proportionately more time building when the water level approached the top of the nest. However, individual nest height remained relatively constant and did not increase considerably during the laying period, suggesting that the majority of nest building occurred before laying began. Nest building during the laying and incubation periods may therefore function mainly to counteract settling and improve the structural integrity of the nest. Although they continue to build throughout the nesting cycle, parents may not be able to prevent nest flooding when faced with rapidly rising water...|$|E

We examined this possibility in breeding populations of the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) kept for several years in semi-natural conditions. We investigated whether they displayed a pattern of mate choice according to the genetic similarity and whether it was context-dependent. Mate choice depended on genetic similarity with the partner and also on age and condition. There was no systematic avoidance of inbreeding. Females of intermediate ages, more monogamous, did not mate with genetically similar partners, whereas younger and older females, more polyandrous, did but <b>highest</b> <b>clutch</b> proportions were associated with intermediate values of pair-relatedness. These results indicate dynamic mate choice, suggesting that individuals of different phenotypes select their partners in different ways according to their genetic similarity.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of Lesser Snow Geese (Ansercaerulescens caerulescens) at La Perouse Bay was examined in individuals retaining {{and in those}} changing their mate of the previous breeding season. Females retaining their mate had on average a slightly <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> size than those which did not. Other measures of reproductive success {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups. The phenomenon of larger clutch size was not detectable in samples of older females. Females breeding for the second time, whether they changed mates or not, had a smaller clutch than did older birds, and clutch size was found to increase with age and/or experience, at least up to the third breeding attempt. We conclude that there is no causative relationship between mate loss and lowered clutch size. Nevertheless, females who breed for the first time are more likely to lose their mates and to have a lower-than-average clutch size as second-time breeders. In addition, first-time breeders were less co-ordinated in nest defence than more experienced birds...|$|R

The following parameters were measured: number of eggs per clutch, clutch frequency, annual fecundity (eggs produced per female per year) {{and size of the}} eggs.

40|$|When {{the clutch}} is in {{disengaged}} condition, ideally no torque should be transmitted. However, in reality, the relative motion between the disks causes viscous shearing of fluids in the gap. This {{results in a}} drag torque which is considered as a loss.

A model based on continuity and Navier-Stokes equations, considering laminar flow, is deduced. The drag torque estimated by the model is the sum of drag torque due to shearing of the ATF and mist (suspension of ATF in air) film.

40|$|Maternal {{investment}} in reproduction by oviparous non-avian reptiles is usually limited to pre-ovipositional allocations {{to the number}} and size of eggs and clutches, thus making these species good subjects for testing hypotheses of reproductive optimality models. Because leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) stand out among oviparous amniotes by having the <b>highest</b> <b>clutch</b> frequency and producing the largest mass of eggs per reproductive season, we quantified maternal investment of 146 female leatherbacks over four nesting seasons (2001 – 2004) and found high inter- and intra-female variation in several reproductive characteristics. Estimated clutch frequency [coefficient of variation (CV) = 31 %] and clutch size (CV = 26 %) varied more among females than did egg mass (CV = 9 %) and hatchling mass (CV = 7 %). Moreover, clutch size had an approximately threefold <b>higher</b> effect on <b>clutch</b> mass than did egg mass. These results generally support predictions of reproductive optimality models in which species that lay several, large clutches per reproductive season should exhibit low variation in egg size and instead maximize egg number (clutch frequency and/or size). The number of hatchlings emerging per nest {{was positively correlated with}} clutch size, but fraction of eggs in a clutch yielding hatchlings (emergence success) was not correlated with clutch size and varied highly among females. In addition, seasonal fecundity and seasonal hatchling production increased with the frequency and the size of clutches (in order of effect size). Our results demonstrate that female leatherbacks exhibit high phenotypic variation in reproductive traits, possibly in response to environmental variability and/or resulting from genotypic variability within the population. Furthermore, high seasonal and lifetime fecundity of leatherbacks probably reflect compensation for high and unpredictable mortality during early life history stages in this species...|$|R

40|$|Despite convincing {{evidence}} that carotenoid availability can have positive physiological effects, we still lack information on the functional consequences of carotenoid limitation at the behavioral level. Given the role carotenoids play in mitigating oxidative stress produced during physical activity and as immunostimulants, one behavioral function on which {{they may have a}} significant impact is an individual's capacity to provide parental care. We tested this hypothesis using three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a species in which males provide obligate and intensive paternal care. Males were fed either high or low (but biologically realistic) levels of carotenoids and monitored throughout incubation, during which we quantified 2 key aspects of parental care: their ability to fan their eggs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (when both the costs and requirements of fanning increase) and their ability to defend their nest against a simulated conspecific male. High-carotenoid diet males fanned their eggs at a significantly higher rate during hypoxic (but not normoxic) conditions and had <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> hatching success than males fed the low-carotenoid diet. There was no evidence that they defended their nest more aggressively. Furthermore, low-carotenoid diet males also appeared to engage in cannibalization of their clutch. These results demonstrate that dietary carotenoid availability can affect a male's ability to provide parental care, and we discuss the potential mechanisms and implications of this finding.

40|$|Sexually {{selected}} {{traits are}} often condition-dependent {{and are expected}} to be affected by genome-wide distributed deleterious mutations and inbreeding. However, sexual selection is a powerful selective force that can counteract inbreeding through purging of deleterious mutations. Inbreeding and purging of the inbreeding load for sexually selected traits has rarely been studied across natural populations with different degrees of inbreeding. Here we investigate inbreeding effects (measured as marker-based heterozygosity) on condition-dependent sexually selected signalling trait and other morphological traits across islet- and mainland populations (n = 15) of an endemic lizard species (Podarcis gaigeae). Our data suggest inbreeding depression on a condition-dependent sexually selected signalling character among mainland subpopulations with low or intermediate levels of inbreeding, but no sign of inbreeding depression among small and isolated islet populations despite their higher overall inbreeding levels. In contrast, there was no such pattern among ten other morphological traits which are primarily naturally selected and presumably not involved in sexual signalling. These results are in line with purging of recessive deleterious alleles, or purging in combination with stochastic fixation of alleles by genetic drift, for a sexual signalling character in the islet environment, which is characterized by low population sizes and strong sexual selection. <b>Higher</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes in islet populations also raise interesting questions regarding the possibility of antagonistic pleiotropy.

5000|$|Early synapsids, as {{far back}} as their known {{evolutionary}} debut in the Late Carboniferous period, may have laid parchment-shelled (leathery) eggs which lacked a calcified layer, as most modern reptiles and monotremes do. This may also explain why there is no fossil evidence for synapsid eggs to date. Because they were vulnerable to desiccation, secretions from apocrine-like glands may have helped keep the eggs moist. According to Oftedal, early synapsids may have buried the eggs into moisture laden soil, hydrating them with contact with the moist skin, or may have carried them in a moist pouch, similar to that of monotremes, though this would limit the mobility of the parent. The latter may have been the primitive form of egg care in synapsids rather than simply burying the eggs, and the constraint on the parent's mobility would have been solved by having the eggs [...] "parked" [...] in nests during foraging or other activities and periodically be hydrated, allowing <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes than could fit inside a pouch (or pouches) at once, and large eggs, which would be cumbersome to carry in a pouch, would be easier to care for.

Understanding which wetland types {{are most important}} to amphibian production is critical for focusing conservation efforts. We compared reproduction of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and production of wood frog juveniles between seasonal (vernal pools) and semi-permanent (beaver-created ponds) wetlands in the central Adirondack region of the northeastern United States. In 65 seasonal wetlands and 37 semi-permanent wetlands over 3 years, densities of wood frog egg masses were similar, but seasonal wetlands contained 4 × as many spotted salamander egg masses as did semi-permanent wetlands. For wood frogs, survival to metamorphosis and juvenile production were {{an order of magnitude}} higher in semi-permanent wetlands. Models of wood frog production linked to the climatic record predicted that, depending on annual variation in rainfall and survival to metamorphosis, semi-permanent wetlands may produce annually 1. 2 - 23 × the number of wood frogs that seasonal wetlands produce within the study area. Models incorporating variation in demographic traits throughout the range of wood frogs suggest that higher survival to metamorphosis in beaver ponds and <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> densities in vernal pools strongly influence metamorph production on a regional basis. Semi-permanent wetlands make major contributions to amphibian production in our region and may also be an important source of colonists to seasonal wetlands following periods of drought.

50|$|This large {{milkweed}} bug is a hemimetabolous insect, {{meaning it}} grows in stages called instars and goes through incomplete metamorphisis exhibiting small changes throughout development such as coloration changes, development of wings and genitalia. O. fasciatus begins as an egg and experiences 4 nymphal stages over 28-30 days before moulting to adulthood. Females become sexually receptive {{within a few}} days of adulthood. Geographic location has a large effect on egg production rate and clutch size, although the intrinsic increase in reproduction depends on what the individual is acclimated to. For example, two close populations (60 km apart) residing on a sharp incline have differing optimal reproduction temperatures where the cooler (higher) adapted populations is at 23 °C and the warmer (lower) population is adapted to 27 °C. <b>Highest</b> <b>clutch</b> size occurs in Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas populations at 30-50 eggs per clutch. Lowest clutch size was found in California at 25-30 eggs per clutch. Iowa and Maryland (northern populations) exhibited a clutch size in between the two extremes from 25-35 eggs per clutch. In favourable conditions (tropics) reproduction occurs continuously all year round, in less-favourable conditions (temperate zones) reproduction occurs during the warmer months. Reproducing when migrants arrive introduces gene flow between northern and southern populations, this provides an advantage to the mid-range populations (variable climates) because females then can ensure genetic variability.The milkweed bug can produce anywhere from 1-3 generations per year depending on climate and geographic location.

In Central Europe, eggs average 59.8 x 49.5 mm, and in Siberia, eggs average 59.4 x 50.1 mm. Their eggs are only slightly larger than those of snowy owls and the nominate subspecies of great horned owl, while similar in size to those of spot-bellied eagle-owls and Blakiston's fish owls. The Eurasian eagle-owl’s eggs are noticeably larger than those of Indian and pharaoh eagle-owls. Usually clutch size is 1 to 2, rarely 3 to 4 and exceptionally to 6. The average number of eggs laid varies with latitude in Europe. Mean clutch size averages 2.02-2.14 in Spain and the massifs of France, 1.82 to 1.89 in central Europe and the eastern Alps; in Sweden and Finland the clutch size averages 1.56 and 1.87, respectively. While variation based on climate is not unusual for different wide-ranging palearctic species, the <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> size of western Mediterranean eagle-owls is also probably driven by the presence of lagomorphs in the diet, which provide high nutritional value than most other regular prey. The average clutch size, attributed as 2.7, was the lowest of any European owl per one study. One species was attributed with an even lower clutch size in North America, the great grey owl with a mean of 2.6, but the mean clutch size was much higher for the same species in Europe, at 4.05.|$|R

40|$|Although {{studies on}} the {{evolution}} and function of female ornaments have become more numerous in the last years, {{the majority of these}} studies were carried out in cases where female ornaments were a smaller and duller version of the ornaments found in males. There are substantially fewer studies on species with female-specific ornaments. However, no study so far investigated the potential of female-specific colouration as a quality signal in birds with conventional sex roles. We studied female-specific ornamentation in a strongly sexually dichromatic species, the upland goose Chloephaga picta leucoptera, in two consecutive years. Male upland geese have white head and breast feathers and black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown head and breast feathers and conspicuous yellow-orange legs. We found that female-specific colouration in upland geese can reliably indicate different aspects of female phenotypic quality. Females with more orange coloured legs and more red-like head colours had <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> and egg volumes than females with a paler leg and head colouration, and a more reddish plumage colouration was related to a higher body condition. These relationships provide the theoretic possibility for males to assess female phenotypic quality on the basis of colouration. Furthermore, the females with a more orange-like tarsus colouration had higher plasma carotenoid levels. Both tarsus colouration and carotenoid concentrations of individual females were highly correlated across years, indicating that tarsus colour is a stable signal. Despite this correlation, small individual differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations between the two study years were related to differences in tarsus colouration. We thus show {{for the first time in}} a wild bird and under natural conditions that carotenoid-based integument colouration remains consistent between individuals in consecutive years and is also a dynamic trait reflecting individual changes in carotenoid levels. In this species, where pairs form life-long bonds, the honesty of the carotenoid-based integument colouration suggests that it may be a sexually selected female ornament that has evolved through male mate choice...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. - Suriname beaches {{support a}} major nesting colony of {{leatherback}} turtles. During the 1999 - 2005 nesting seasons, we collected data on nesting ecology and identified individual turtles that nested at Babunsanti (Galibi Nature Reserve), Samsambo, Kolukumbo, and Matapica. We observed 8462 leatherback females, 6933 {{of which we}} PIT-tagged. The remaining 1529 females carried PIT tags of a non-Surinamese origin. Because complete coverage of all nesting beaches was not possible over the study period, estimations of minimum annual nesting colony size were made, which ranged from 1545 to 5500 females in Suriname alone. Of the 7394 turtles observed during 1999 - 2004, 14. 8 % were seen renesting by 2005. Annual mean internesting period ranged between 9. 4 - 1. 0 to 9. 6 - 1. 0 days. Annual mean observed clutch frequency was between 1. 6 - 1. 0 to 3. 1 - 1. 4 and annual minimum estimated clutch frequency between 4. 1 - 1. 6 to 4. 9 6 1. 8 clutches. Annual mean standard curved carapace length ranged from 154. 1 6 6. 7 to 155. 6 6 6. 7 cm, and annual mean clutch size ranged from 80. 8 - 18. 3 to 88. 2 - 19. 5 yolked eggs. Annual average hatch success (including nests with zero hatching) ranged from 10. 6 % - 16. 4 to 25. 8 % - 24. 4 at Babunsanti, and from 52. 7 % - 6 29. 7 to 56. 0 % 6 30. 8 at Matapica. Remigrants and non-Surinamese turtles were, on average, larger than new females, and remigrants had a <b>higher</b> <b>clutch</b> frequency. In 6 years, the annual proportion of newly tagged females decreased from 89. 9 % to 40. 5 % and that of remigrants increased from 0 % to 45. 6 %. However, the annual proportion of turtles with a non-Surinamese PIT tag (10. 1 % to 17. 6 %) was relatively stable. Combined with the moderate frequency of intra- and interseasonal nesting exchange between regional beaches, this indicates that although the Suriname/French Guiana leatherbacks form a single rookery, individual females show strong nesting fidelity {{to one side of}} the Marowijne Estuary...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensive}} tank {{culture of}} ornamental mouthbrooding cichlids poses several problems which limit their aquaculture potential. This project addressed {{some of these}} problems for Aulonocara baenschi. The production of juveniles in 2501 aquaria was accelerated when: a) aquaria were equipped with refuges, b) females of less than 70 mm in standard length were used as broodstock, c) mouthbrooding females were replaced with gravid females at seven day intervals, and d) embryos were removed from the mouths of females at replacement times for artificial incubation. Two sex ratios also accelerated juvenile production. The sex ratio (male:females) 1 : 30 yielded the highest spawning returns per tank, and therefore represented the most effective utilization of aquarium space (a critical consideration for the small-scale culturist). Contrastingly, the sex ratio 1 : 12 yielded the <b>highest</b> <b>clutch</b> sizes and a high percentage female spawning return, and therefore represented the most effective utilization of broodstock (an important consideration for culturists inhibited by financial constraints or having an abundance of culture vessels). The reproductive behaviour of A. baenschi was described. Emphasis was given to aspects of reproduction of relevance to culture, for example; spawning times and seasons, clutch size and its relationship with female size, age and size of sexes at first spawning, embryo development rate and size of first swimming juveniles. The slow growth rate of juveniles, combined with a late attainment of marketable size (± seven months) was a major limitation affecting the cuIture potential of A. baenschi. Two factors favouring the cuIture of this species was the high survival rate recorded for both adults and juveniles, and the comparatively high prices fetched by fish on domestic wholesale markets (R 4, 00 per fish). It is recommended that A. baenschi should not be cultured exclusively for the relatively small South African ornamental fish market. A more profitable strategy for domestic culturists should involve a major production effort with A. baenschi and other desirable species of Aulonocara (e. g. A. ethelwynnae; A. hansbaenschi; A. stuartgranti & A. maylandi) for foreign markets (in particular, the U. S. A.; Western Europe & Japan). Not only are these markets massive, but prevailing exchange rates of the Rand with these currencies favour such a strategy...|$|R
