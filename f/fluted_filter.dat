50|$|The {{last two}} {{attributes}} of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for recrystallization. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete dissolution. The receiving flask {{is filled with}} a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a <b>fluted</b> <b>filter</b> paper into the receiving flask. Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the filter funnel warm, avoiding the premature crystallization.|$|E
3000|$|... pH-values and conductivities of the {{thoroughly}} vortexed {{samples were}} determined {{at room temperature}} by standard electrodes (pH 10 -Pen, Qcond 2400, both VWR International, Darmstadt, Germany). VFA/TIC-values (ratio of volatile fatty acids to total inorganic carbonate) were determined in gram VFA per gram of CaCO 3 after the samples had been centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5  min and passed through a <b>fluted</b> <b>filter</b> as proposed by Thrän et al. (2012). In addition, trace elements (DIN ISO 11885), nutrients (DIN ISO 11885), fatty acids (DIN 38409 H 21), dry substance (DIN EN 12880), organic dry substance (DIN EN 12879), total nitrogen (DIN ISO 11261), and ammonia nitrogen (DIN 38406 -E 5) were determined by an external service laboratory (Schmack Biogas GmbH, Schwandorf, Germany).|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} by which the relationship between length, tension, rate of contraction and oxygen consumption can be studied in masses of cardiac tissues weighing as little as 2 nig. (dry weight). The results presented suggest that satisfactory physiologic conditions prevail. IN OUR studies on cardiac efficiency, it wasessential to record simultaneously the length, tension, rate of contraction and oxygen consumption of isolated cardiac muscle. Avail-able technics 1 ' 2 were inappropriate and a new method was devised. Emphasis in this paper is on the description and testing of the technic and the differences in QO 2 during rest and activity with and without added epinephrine. METHODS Figure I presents a labeled diagram of the ap-paratus in the operating position {{with one of the}} 3 chambers submerged almost to the Incite floor (Q) of the water bath. The chamber is shown cut-away to reveal inner structures. The basic material used for the chamber was molded cpoxy resin (Epocast) * which is an inert, hard but machinable plastic. The total volume of the system is about 13 ml. including the manometer and connecting line. When 8 ml. of media arc used and with 2, 2, 4,trimetlvylpentane (specific gravity 0. 7) as the manomete fluid, the 3 chamber constants are 0. 35, 0. 37 and 0. 41. For the preliminary testing of the chambers the excised, spontaneously beating rat atria 3 and the rat diaphragm were used. Later experiments utilized the cat papillary 4 and the rat ventricle strip. 5 The media used are listed in table 1. With the bicarbonate-buffered media, diethanolamine solu-tion, 6 stabilized with 0. 1 per cent thiourea, 7 was the CO 2 absorber. Potassium hydroxide KOH (20 per cent) was used with the phosphate-buffered media. 4 Before the tissues were prepared, three uncovered chambers were partly submerged in the lucitc-walled, constant temperature bath maintained at 37. 3 ± 0. 02 C. The medium was pipetted into the chamber and two strips of <b>fluted</b> <b>filter</b> paper (0. 3 x 7 cm...|$|E
