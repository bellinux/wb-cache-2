Moreover, it was believed the creditors had no legal right to claim compensation towards the Landsbanki receivership for any potential losses they may suffer, because of exchange rate fluctuations after 22 April 2009.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide new {{evidence}} on the pricing of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> {{in the stock market}} by testing international asset pricing models (IAPMs) under varying market structures and different exchange rate measures. It is composed of three essays. In the first essay, I test unconditional asset pricing models with <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> using country, portfolio and firm level data from nine emerging markets (EMs). It is shown that unlike the case for developed markets where unconditional tests often fail to detect a significant <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premium in stock returns, <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> is unconditionally priced in EMs. However, when local market risk is introduced in the model to take into account potential segmentation effects, <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia are totally subsumed by local risk premia for most countries especially at the firm level. The second essay examines the significance of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> in conditional IAPMs using multivariate GARCH-in-Mean specification and time varying prices of risk. The model tested assumes partial integration and uses real exchange rates to account for both inflation <b>risk</b> and nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> The main empirical results support the hypothesis of significant <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia in EMs equity returns even after accounting for local market <b>risk.</b> The <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> premia are also economically significant as they represent on average 18 percent of total premium, and may reach up to 45 percent of total premium for some countries over sub-periods. In the third essay, I test for the pricing of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> in stock returns using globally diversified sector portfolios. The {{purpose of this}} test is to examine the effect of cross-currency diversification on the global price of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk.</b> Since there is no previous evidence on this issue, I use data on the G 7 countries and EMs. The results suggest that the effects of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> may be less significant in pricing global assets such as global...|$|R

40|$|Our study {{examines}} {{whether there are}} systematic differences in standard leverage determinants for a sample of Japanese multinational (MNCs) and domestic corporations (DCs). We find that on a univariate basis Japanese MNCs differ significantly on most variables relative to Japanese DCs. These variables include leverage, age, collateral value of assets, free cash flows, foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks,</b> growth, non-debt tax shields, political risks, profitability and size. Business risks are {{not found to be}} significantly different between the two groups of organizations. When modeling capital structure and the determinants of capital structure we find that Japanese multinationals have significantly less leverage than Japanese DCs, and that multinationality is an important aspect of leverage for Japanese firms. We find that business risks are not significant for modeling capital structure of domestic firms but they are for multinationals and foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> are not significant for multinationals but are significant for domestic firms. Business risks are negatively related to leverage for multinationals and we document that significant positive leverage effects of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> and size are subsumed by the negative effect of business risks to explain the lower leverage experienced by Japanese multinationals relative to Japanese DCs. The lack of significance of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> for DCs can be explained by economies of scale in risk management, such as derivatives. Domestic firms seem to manage increased foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> through lower leverage rather than derivative use. On the other hand, the larger multinationals can take advantage of economies of scale in risk management. Consequently, foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risks</b> of multinationals can be managed through derivatives and other risk management operations and not reduced leverage. Copyright (c) 2009 The Authors.

40|$|We {{test whether}} foreign investors price foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> {{differently}} from local investors. Drawing from the closed-end country fund literature, {{we argue that}} both differential access to information by foreign versus local investors and different sources of <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> that investors face (economic or translation exposure) will lead to different pricing of the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> associated with American Depositary Receipt (ADR) investments. We apply a two-step method to country portfolios of ADRs of Australia, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our results show that foreign investors generally price <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> differently from local investors, and that the source and magnitude of differences in <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> pricing vary significantly across countries. Although significant differences in pricing <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> between foreign and local investors are observed for Australia, France, and Japan, no such pricing difference is noticed for the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the pricing differences observed for Australian and French ADRs are mainly attributed to the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> of underlying share returns (economic exposure), whereas the pricing differences for Japanese ADRs are mainly attributed to the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> associated with currency translation (translation exposure).

40|$|An {{important}} issue in global corporate risk management {{is whether the}} multinationality of a firm matters {{in terms of its}} effect on <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposure. In this paper, we examine the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposure of US firms during 1983 - 2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the <b>exchange</b> <b>risk</b> exposures are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multinationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications.
