25|$|The steppe {{has long}} been {{depicted}} as the typical Russian landscape. It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before ending in Manchuria. Most of the Soviet Union's steppe zone was located in the Ukrainian and Kazakh republics; the much smaller Russian steppe is located mainly between those nations, extending southward between the Black and Caspian Seas before blending into the increasingly desiccated territory of the Republic of Kalmykia. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts. The soil is very dry.|$|E

25|$|In the {{occupied}} territory the Soviets created revolutionary committees and soviets based on structures developed in Russia. Unlike elsewhere, Lithuanian communist organizations {{were young and}} had not yet developed a network of supporting local councils. They nationalized commercial institutions and large estates. The land was {{to be used for}} collective farming instead of being redistributed to small farmers. The Soviet propagated internationalism and atheism <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> staunch Catholics and determined nationalists. Soviets were supported by the industrial working class, but it was too small in Lithuania. The Soviets demanded large war contributions from captured cities and villages. For example, Panevėžys was required to pay 1,000,000, Utena – 200,000, villagers – 10 rubles. Such policies alienated local population and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Soviets. For example, in February Kapsukas sent a telegram to Moscow arguing that conscription of local Lithuanians to the Red Army would only encourage Lithuanians to volunteer for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
25|$|The new {{minister}} {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the political establishment over the issue of land redistribution: promised by Ion I. C. Brătianu's National Liberal (PNL) government during World War I, and partly carried out in December 1918, the move viewed as incomplete - expropriations had not led to a redefinition of peasant property, and land had remained with provisional cooperatives instead of being allocated to members. Mihalache supported the fragmentation of all land property <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> medium to small sized landowners. The Peasants' Party calculated leaving no landowner with more than on one square kilometre, which also included expropriating land for common pasture. At the same time, Vaida-Voevod's government created a conflict over its projects for constitutional reform, clashing with the PNL over the highly centralized government and support for the 1866 Constitution of Romania advocated by the latter. Mihalache is also known to have traveled incognito to various locations, as a means to observe first-hand abuse by government officials.|$|E
25|$|As the {{incumbent}} was ineligible for re-election, many candidates {{took the opportunity}} to vie for position of the head of state (the highest political office in the country, although in Croatia, a parliamentary republic, the role of president is largely ceremonial and the Prime Minister - Head of Government - wields most power). Most mainstream Croatian political parties participated in the election either by nominating a candidate or endorsing one, but major party official candidates alone did not dominate the campaign. The relatively low nomination threshold (ten thousand signatures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> four million voters), turmoil in the largest political party (Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ) due to the departure of long-time leader Ivo Sanader and the ongoing economic crisis, as well as a significant one-man revolt in the second-largest party (Social Democratic Party of Croatia, SDP), caused the first round of this election to field the largest number of candidates so far.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{allowed the}} free sale and {{consumption}} of alcohol for three decades from 1947, but restrictions were introduced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto just weeks before he was removed as prime minister in 1977. Since then, only members of non-Muslim minorities such as Hindus, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to apply for alcohol permits. The monthly quota is dependent upon one's income, but usually is about five bottles of liquor or 100 bottles of beer. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> 180 million, only about 60 outlets are allowed to sell alcohol. The Murree Brewery in Rawalpindi was once the only legal brewery, but today there are more.

Members of religious minorities, however, often sell their liquor permits to Muslims as part of a continuing black market trade in alcohol.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} a {{difference}} between Marine Le Pen's and her father's views concerning the Holocaust and Jews.

[...] He has repeated the latter claim several times. Also in 2004, Bruno Gollnisch said [...] "I do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths. As to the existence of gas chambers, it is up to historians to speak their minds" [...] (de se déterminer). Jean-Marie Le Pen received fines for this sentence, Bruno Gollnisch was found not guilty by the Court of Cassation. The current leader of the party, Marine Le Pen distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest against her father's comment.|$|E
500|$|The opinion (written by Chief Justice Morrison Waite) {{first asked}} whether Minor was {{a citizen of}} the United States, and {{answered}} that she was, citing both the Fourteenth Amendment and earlier common law.

[...] Under the common law, according to the court, [...] "it was never doubted that all children born <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. [...] These were natives, or natural-born citizens, as distinguished from aliens or foreigners." [...] The court observed that some authorities [...] "include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents"—but since Minor was born in the United States and her parents were U.S. citizens, she was unquestionably a citizen herself, even under the narrowest possible definition, and the court thus noted that the subject {{did not need to be}} explored in any greater depth.|$|E
