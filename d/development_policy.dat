40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{capital tax}} competition affects transfer and <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the presence}} of regional income disparity. In each country, <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> determine the number of rich (poor) regions that (do not) engage in production activities, while transfer policies redistribute income between rich and poor regions. The mix of transfer and <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> is inefficient under tax competition: conditional on the equilibrium tax rate, too much revenue is spent on <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> and too little on transfer policies. This analysis of the expenditure mix implies that <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> are used as a means of regional redistribution even if transfer policies are efficient instruments for this purpose. Moreover, it is shown that the overall level of public expenditure may be too high because of the possibility of over-development.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} way public {{authorities}} can fundament {{and evaluate the}} local economic <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> they want to promote, according to their efficiency. After presenting the relevant literature overview regarding the local economic <b>development</b> and its <b>policies,</b> we try to underline the importance of evaluating and prioritizing the local <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> and also to propose an efficiency-based model that we later use in building and evaluating local <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> scenarios. The research methodology is both descriptive, while presenting the theoretical framework, and empirical, while building scenarios and evaluating local policies. The obtained results show us that the local policy we tested is efficient, enabling new investments to bring bigger financial benefits than the cost needed to attract them. local <b>development,</b> <b>policies,</b> measuring, efficiency...|$|R

5|$|In 1990, the NEP was {{replaced}} by the National <b>Development</b> <b>Policy</b> (NDP), which continued most of the NEP-era policies. The Malay share of the economy, though substantially larger, was not near the 30% target according to government figures. In its review of the NEP, the government found that although income inequality had been reduced, some important targets related to overall Malay corporate ownership had not been met. Both Mahathir and the Tunku had expressed concern that the Malays remained too reliant on the Chinese economically.|$|E

Thus, the China Western <b>Development</b> <b>policy</b> aimed to attract foreign investment.

The creation of a new economic zone would encourage cooperation between cities, which would lead to greater rates of progress.|$|E

Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and <b>Development</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

5|$|Race is a {{significant}} force in politics, and many political parties are ethnically based. Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National <b>Development</b> <b>Policy</b> which superseded it, were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera, consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia, over non-bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment, education, scholarships, business, and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings. However, it has generated greater interethnic resentment. There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles. Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party {{with the support of}} UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government.|$|E

In this paper we aim to show that this division need not remain still and that the foundations of top-down and bottom-up <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> can be reconciled in a joint 'meso-level' conceptual framework which can serve simultaneously as a deductive justification for bottom-up local and regional <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> and as a coordination device between different <b>policies.</b> <b>development</b> policies; top-down; bottom-up; integrated framework...|$|R
