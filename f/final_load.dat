500|$|A 20th-century {{modification}} of the compartment boat system was used to feed the coal-fired Ferrybridge [...] "C" [...] power station. Starting in 1967, Cawoods Hargreaves used trains of three tubs or coal pans, which were rigidly connected, and pushed by a tug when loaded. The trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station, where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt. Nine tugs and 35 pans were employed, with each pan holding around 170 tonnes. By the time the <b>final</b> <b>load</b> left Astley colliery in December 2002, 43 million tonnes had been delivered to Ferrybridge in this way. Experiments were made with trains of four pans, which allowed copper pipes to be carried {{on top of the}} coal for delivery to Goole, but this was short-lived. Coal carrying came to an abrupt halt in 2003 when the St Aidan's opencast mine was exhausted and the coal from Kellingley colliery was found to have levels of sulphur content high above the acceptable limit. During 2008, three of the trains were used on the River Don, to transport 250,000 tonnes of limestone from a quarry at Cadeby to Hexthorpe.|$|E

5000|$|In 1920, Galligan bought {{what was}} called the Beaver Dam Tract. The Galligans who had been {{quarrying}} continued to do so on the property. The quarry at Reservation employed 400 people; the tanneries and the gristmills employed many of the local residents. There was also a tourist boom that saw as many as 300 guests come to Oakland Valley during the summer. The quarrying industry was totally located on the Reservation property. The slate was cut in huge squares several inches thick and several feet wide. It was then hand cut and pulled out on carts by ox teams. The quarrying went on though the Reservation with the site of the Peterson lodge being a central station for bringing in the slate to have it weighed. Reservations stone was used for windowsills, sidewalks and curbstones. The slate went as far away as Montreal Canada and New York City. In fact, New York City hall has a sidewalk that was taken from Reservation. By 1930 large scale quarrying at Reservation had ended. An entire industry was extinguished as fast as it had started. In 1940 Michael Lee Galligan sold his <b>final</b> <b>load</b> of slate from Reservation. In 1941 Avery Skinner sold the <b>final</b> <b>load</b> of slate.

30|$|Prior to {{the peak}} strength, the {{unloading}} path is almost overlapping with the reloading path, {{and in this}} interval the hysteretic energy dissipation is not evident. However, in the post-peak region, the hysteretic loop becomes more obvious as the loading cycles increased. Then with increasing loading cycles, the energy dissipation capacity of concrete turns smaller or even disappears at the <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> stage. Compared to plain concrete, the hysteretic energy dissipation capacity of PFRC is stronger due to fiber sliding and pull-out mechanisms which are the main contributors to the energy dissipation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of aerial topdressing {{led to a}} short-term increase in freight traffic towards the middle of 1952, as large volumes of superphosphate were required in the district. However, this did not last, and after lingering on {{for a few more}} years the end came in 1959, by which time keeping the line open cost more than three times its annual revenue. [...] Despite the activities of a Railway Promotion League persisting into the 1950s to have the line extended to Taneatua, the branch officially closed on 14 March 1959. The last working train ran a month later, on 14 April, bringing out a <b>final</b> <b>load</b> of road metal for highway improvements that would use the railway alignment once the rails had been lifted.|$|E
50|$|Load {{transfer}} is {{of critical importance}} for vehicle stability in vehicles such as SUVs. Ideally in high performance applications load transfer tends to be minimized as a tire's performance is directly affected {{by the amount of}} load that it has to transmit. In a steady state turn the <b>final</b> <b>load</b> transfer, summed across all the axles, is only related to the position of the center of mass above the ground, the track width and the lateral acceleration. SUVs must shift their center of mass lower, widen their wheel track, or decrease their lateral acceleration to avoid tipping. To keep them from tipping many auto manufacturers use tires with lower grip to reduce the vehicles cornering capacity, or the roll stiffness balance front to rear can be altered to encourage understeer or oversteer as necessary to limit the maximum lateral acceleration of the vehicle.|$|E

The use of full-span prestressed concrete form panels for bridges with spans of 40 ft. or less is an economical method of construction due to the reduction of on-site form work and associated labor required by alternate cast-in-place systems. In this research, two bridges were subjected to 5 million cycles of repeated service loading prior to a <b>final</b> <b>loading</b> to failure.

5000|$|Porthmadog {{expanded}} {{rapidly as}} a slate exporting port. Welsh slate {{was in high}} demand as a construction material in the English industrial cities, and was transported to the new port by horse-drawn tramways. The Ffestiniog Railway, opened in 1836 as a gravity railway, horses hauled the empty slate wagons {{back up to the}} quarries, was converted to steam operation in 1863, and trains ran straight onto the wharves. By 1873 116,000 tons (117,800 t) of slate were being shipped out of Porthmadog, and other trade was being developed. The Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire Steamship Company had been formed in 1864 and purchased the Rebecca to carry stores from Liverpool to supply the growing town. [...] The First World War marked the end of Porthmadog's export trade. No new ships were built, several were sunk by enemy action, and most of the surviving fleet was sold. The arrival of the LNWR, in 1879, and the GWR, in 1883, at Blaenau Ffestiniog was responsible for the steady decline in the slate traffic carried by the Festiniog Railway and by Portmadoc shipping. Some slate had been carried via the Festiniog Railway, the Croesor & Portmadoc Railway and the Cambrian Railways after the latter's line had been opened between Barmouth and Pwllheli in 1867; this traffic was diverted to the exchange yard established between the Festiniog Railway and the Cambrian Railways at Minffordd in 1872. By 1925 less than five percent of Ffestiniog's slate output went out by sea. The <b>final</b> <b>load</b> of slate, delivered by rail, left by sea from Porthmadog in 1946 and two months later the railway ceased commercial operations.|$|E
