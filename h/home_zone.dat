25|$|Historically, {{because of}} its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned {{at least since the}} 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is {{determined}} by a state school enrolment scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated <b>home</b> <b>zone,</b> and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to those out of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it could ultimately lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the resale value of their homes.|$|E
2500|$|Lead and Gold {{features}} six game modes {{to choose}} from. [...] The first, Shootout, {{is a standard}} team deathmatch game mode. [...] Conquest mode is similar to Unreal Tournament 2004s Onslaught mode. The objective of Conquest is to conquer waypoints in order. One team starts at their <b>home</b> <b>zone</b> and moves towards the enemy zone, while the other team advances in the other direction. Conquering a zone unlocks the next zone in the sequence. Clearing a zone of enemies and staying in the zone until your flag is raised will conquer that zone.|$|E
2500|$|The Education Amendment Act 2000, {{enacted by}} the Fifth Labour Government, {{partially}} solved this problem by putting in place a new [...] "system for determining enrolment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding." [...] Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined [...] "home zone". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house (if it has one) gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's <b>home</b> <b>zone</b> can be admitted, if there are places available, {{in the following order}} of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of past students; children of board employees and staff; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a randomly drawn ballot. The system is complicated by some state schools having boarding facilities for students living beyond the school's zone. Typically these students live in isolated farming regions in New Zealand, or their parents may live or work partly overseas. Many secondary schools offer limited scholarships to their boarding establishment to attract talented students in imitation of private school practice.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "woonerf" [...] {{has been}} adopted {{directly}} by some English-language publications.

50|$|The main {{enabling}} legislation for <b>home</b> <b>zones</b> {{is given in}} section 268 of the Transport Act 2000 which allows the creation of 'use orders' which are orders that 'permit {{the use of a}} road for purposes other than passage'. In 2002 Farley Bank, a cul-de-sac in Hastings was designated as a Play Street giving children traffic-free space for play between 8am and sunset.|$|R
50|$|<b>Home</b> <b>zones</b> often {{involved}} {{the use of}} shared space, where the street is not strongly divided into exclusive pedestrian and traffic areas. Concerns have been expressed over the inability of blind and partially sighted people to use shared space streets.

40|$|This article aims to {{understand}} whether streets {{designed to be}} more liveable encourage {{a greater variety of}} street users and activities. To date {{there is little evidence that}} traffic calming or speed limits alone result in a change in how streets are used. This study is focused on more radical treatments. It discusses UK streets that conform to woonerf design criteria, which in the United Kingdom are called <b>home</b> <b>zones.</b> Seven recently completed new-build case studies were observed for 6 hours each and the nature of activity within the street environments was recorded. The results show that children in particular used the streets intensively for long periods, and that they engaged in a wide variety of play activities across the whole area of the street with relative freedom. Adults were also seen spending time in <b>home</b> <b>zones,</b> but the sense is that this was in response to the children playing there. The results suggest that these more radical street treatments are lived in and used differently compared to streets with just speed limit controls or traffic calming...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} New Zealand studies have {{identified}} a relationship between enrolment regulations and school enrolments, in particular drawing attention to the negative impact that the abandonment of ‘home zones’ in 1991 have had on many lower decile and ethnically diverse schools. The progress {{of a group of}} secondary schools within a geographic area in New Zealand from before the introduction of Tomorrow’s Schools in 1989 up to 2009 is tracked using quantitative data from the Ministry of Education, New Zealand Qualifications Authority and Statistics New Zealand combined with qualitative data from interviews with those who were principals during the period. This mixed-methods approach shows that both enrolment numbers and academic achievement in three of the four schools fell and then rose almost simultaneously with the removal in 1991 and then reinstatement in 2000 of geographic <b>home</b> <b>zones.</b> The ethnic and socioeconomic polarisation that resulted from the earlier change, however, has not reversed. The quantitative and qualitative data together provide clear evidence that geographic <b>home</b> <b>zones</b> provide a level of stability and security in the provision of education at a local level that is not matched by the alternative regulatory regime that operated in the 1990 s...|$|R
