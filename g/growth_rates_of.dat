5|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> pterosaurs {{once they}} hatched varied across {{different}} groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo {{method is}} used to capture the {{evolution}} of spherulites and shish-kebabs and to predict the crystallization kinetics in isothermal polymer crystallization. Effects of nucleation density and <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> spherulites, nucleation density, and length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> shish-kebabs, respectively, on crystallization are investigated. Results show that nucleation densities of both spherulites and shish-kebabs strongly affect crystallization rate as well as morphology. An increase in nucleation density of either spherulites or shish-kebabs leads to a quicker crystallization rate and a smaller average spherulite size. It is also shown that nucleation density of shish-kebabs has a stronger impact on crystallization <b>rate.</b> <b>Growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> spherulites and length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> shish-kebabs also have significant effect on crystallization rate and morphology. An increase in <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> spherulites or length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> shish-kebabs also speeds up the crystallization rate; additionally, a decrease in <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> spherulites or an increase in length <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> shish-kebabs results in a more highly anisotropic shish-kebab structure and a smaller average size of spherulites.

5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E
