5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters {{ranging in size}} from <b>dimers</b> to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion of the cluster may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster moving at once. All of these processes involve a change in the cluster’s center of mass.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin <b>dimers</b> and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an elastic neutral <b>dimer</b> formed by two bound equal masses carrying opposite charges and moving along an electrically active filament in one dimension. An ac electrical field drives the two <b>dimer</b> heads, when set free or bound {{together to form}} a rigid rod, to opposite directions, thus yielding a zero net <b>dimer</b> current for zero and infinite elastic constants. Under the same driving conditions, an elastically deformable <b>dimer</b> can get rectified and the ensuing net current maximized for an optimal value of <b>dimer</b> elastic constant. The dependence of the <b>dimer</b> current on the periodic charge distribution along the filament is analyzed in terms of global symmetries of the <b>dimer</b> dynamics...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent <b>dimers</b> that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} {{are used in}} excimer lasers, {{which are based on}} {{short-lived}} electronically excited molecules known as excimers. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas <b>dimers</b> such as Ar2, Kr2 or Xe2, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce ultraviolet light which, due to its short wavelength (193 nm for ArF and 248nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for microlithography and microfabrication, which are essential for integrated circuit manufacture, and for laser surgery, including laser angioplasty and eye surgery.|$|E
25|$|At high {{concentrations}} of cI, the <b>dimers</b> will also bind to operators OL1 and OL2 (which are over 2 kb downstream from the R operators). When cI <b>dimers</b> are bound to OL1, OL2, OR1, and OR2 a loop is induced in the DNA, allowing these <b>dimers</b> to bind together to form an octamer. This is a phenomenon called long-range cooperativity. Upon formation of the octamer, cI <b>dimers</b> may cooperatively bind to OL3 and OR3, repressing transcription of cI. This autonegative regulation ensures a stable minimum concentration of the repressor molecule and, should SOS signals arise, allows for more efficient prophage induction.|$|E
40|$|Multiconfigurational self-consistent field {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed to investigate structural and electronic properties of cubic siliconcarbide (001) (SiC (001)) surfaces. The <b>dimer</b> on silicon-terminated SiC (001) (Si–SiC (001)) {{is found to be}} diradical in nature, due to destabilization of the π bond by bending the <b>dimer.</b> Since the SiClattice constant is larger than that of diamond, the 3 ̆eC=C 3 ̆c <b>dimer</b> on the carbon-terminated SiC (001) (C–SiC (001)) surface is flatter and its π bond is stronger than those on diamond (001). The bridging <b>dimer</b> on the C–SiC (001) exhibits relatively small multiconfigurational character despite its bent geometry. H 2 adsorption onto the Si–SiC (001) diradical <b>dimer</b> is more favorable than that onto the partial π bonded Si (001) <b>dimer.</b> As the <b>dimer</b> geometry becomes flatter, the π bond becomes stronger and the H 2 adsorption on the <b>dimer</b> becomes less favorable...|$|R

25|$|Carboxylic acids tend to {{have higher}} boiling points than water, {{not only because of}} their {{increased}} surface area, but also because of their tendency to form stabilised <b>dimers.</b> Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these <b>dimers.</b> For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, both of which increase the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.|$|E

40|$|A {{single-chain}} tethered <b>dimer</b> {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus protease (HIV-PR) was produced by expression of a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli. The tethered <b>dimer,</b> which consists of two 99 -amino acid HIV-PR subunits linked together by a pentapeptide, was isolated from inclusion bodies and refolded as an active protease with enzymatic properties {{very similar to those}} of the natural <b>dimer</b> at pH 5. 5. In addition to demonstrating that the tethered <b>dimer</b> is active, we have shown that the tethered <b>dimer</b> is more stable than the natural HIV-PR <b>dimer</b> at pH 7. 0. This is attributed to dissociation of the natural HIV-PR <b>dimer,</b> for which a surprisingly high dissociation constant, 5 X 10 (- 8) M was measured. Furthermore, the tethered <b>dimer</b> offers an opportunity to produce asymmetric <b>dimer</b> mutants and thereby determine the effect of changes in one of the two subunits on protease activity. In one such mutant, a single active-site aspartic residue was changed to a glycine residue. This protein was inactive, consistent with a requirement for an aspartic residue from each subunit to constitute an active site of HIV-PR...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{extracellular}} {{domains of}} cadherins {{are known to}} play a major role in cell adhesion, although the structures involved in this process remain unclear. We have used molecular dynamics to characterize the conformational and thermodynamic properties of two of the <b>dimer</b> interfaces identified in E-cadherin crystals and involving the two outermost exodomains (EC 1 and EC 2) : a <b>dimer</b> involving exchange of the N-terminal strand (referred to as the “swapped” <b>dimer)</b> and a “staggered” <b>dimer</b> involving an EC 1 -EC 2 interface. The results show that the staggered <b>dimer</b> involves a much smaller interface area and is notably less stable than the swapped <b>dimer.</b> It is also found that, despite its stability, the swapped <b>dimer</b> undergoes a conformational transition leading to a structure closer to that experimentally observed for the homologous C-cadherin. Finally, comparing the simulated <b>dimer</b> structures with the sequences of E-, C-, and N-cadherins shows that the swapped <b>dimer</b> interface involves surprisingly few residues that vary from family to family and notably no changes between the E- and C-cadherin exodomains...|$|R
25|$|Another histone {{chaperone}} that {{associates with}} the replisome is Asf1, which {{interacts with the}} Mcm complex dependent on histone <b>dimers</b> H3-H4. Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3-H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the replication fork and this activity makes the H3-H4 histone <b>dimers</b> available {{at the site of}} histone deposition just after replication. Asf1 (and its partner Rtt109) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during S-phase.|$|E
25|$|UVB photons {{can cause}} direct DNA damage. UVB {{radiation}} excites DNA molecules in skin cells, causing aberrant covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases, producing a dimer. Most UV-induced pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> in DNA are removed {{by the process}} known as nucleotide excision repair that employs about 30 different proteins. Those pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death (apoptosis) or can cause DNA replication errors leading to mutation.|$|E
25|$|The heterotrimeric {{chaperone}} chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is a chromatin formation {{protein that}} {{is involved in}} depositing histones onto both newly replicated DNA strands to form chromatin. CAF-1 contains a PCNA-binding motif, called a PIP-box, that allows CAF-1 to associate with the replisome through PCNA {{and is able to}} deposit histone H3-H4 <b>dimers</b> onto newly synthesized DNA. The Rtt106 chaperone is also involved in this process, and associated with CAF-1 and H3-H4 <b>dimers</b> during chromatin formation. These processes load newly synthesized histones onto DNA.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet UVB light (wavelengths between 315 – 280nm) {{from the}} sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane {{pyrimidine}} <b>dimers</b> (CPDs). Thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine or cytosine-thymine <b>dimers</b> are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a DNA strand.
