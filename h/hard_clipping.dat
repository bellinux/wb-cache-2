40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure {{for the creation}} of large-scale video datasets for action classification and localization from unconstrained, realistic web data. The scalability of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by building a novel video benchmark, named SLAC (Sparsely Labeled ACtions), consisting of over 520 K untrimmed videos and 1. 75 M clip annotations spanning 200 action categories. Using our proposed framework, annotating a clip takes merely 8. 8 seconds on average. This represents a saving in labeling time of over 95 % compared to the traditional procedure of manual trimming and localization of actions. Our approach dramatically reduces the amount of human labeling by automatically identifying <b>hard</b> <b>clips,</b> i. e., clips that contain coherent actions but lead to prediction disagreement between action classifiers. A human annotator can disambiguate whether such a clip truly contains the hypothesized action in a handful of seconds, thus generating labels for highly informative samples at little cost. We show that our large-scale dataset can be used to effectively pre-train action recognition models, significantly improving final metrics on smaller-scale benchmarks after fine-tuning. On Kinetics, UCF- 101 and HMDB- 51, models pre-trained on SLAC outperform baselines trained from scratch, by 2. 0 %, 20. 1 % and 35. 4 % in top- 1 accuracy, respectively when RGB input is used. Furthermore, we introduce a simple procedure that leverages the sparse labels in SLAC to pre-train action localization models.

5000|$|Solid-state {{amplifiers}} incorporating transistors and/or op amps {{can be made}} {{to produce}} <b>hard</b> <b>clipping.</b> When symmetrical, this adds additional high-amplitude odd harmonics, creating a [...] "dirty" [...] or [...] "gritty" [...] tone.

Many solid-state distortion devices attempt to emulate the sound of overdriven vacuum valves using additional solid-state circuitry. Some amplifiers (notably the Marshall JCM 900) utilize hybrid designs that employ both valve and solid-state components.|$|E

5000|$|Vacuum tube {{amplifiers}} tend {{to exhibit}} soft clipping; {{as they approach}} the maximum possible output value, the gain tends to drop, rounding {{the tops of the}} signal waveform.

5000|$|Early tube {{amplifiers}} had {{power supplies}} based on rectifier tubes. These supplies were unregulated, a practice {{which continues to}} this day in transistor amplifier designs. The typical anode supply was a rectifier, perhaps half-wave, a choke (inductor) and a filter capacitor. When the tube amplifier was operated at high volume, due to the high impedance of the rectifier tubes, the power supply voltage would dip as the amplifier drew more current (assuming class AB), reducing power output and causing signal modulation. The dipping effect is known as [...] "sag." [...] Sag may be desirable effect for some electric guitarists when compared with <b>hard</b> <b>clipping.</b> As the amplifier load or output increases this voltage drop will increase distortion of the output signal. Sometimes this sag effect is desirable for guitar amplification.|$|E
5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with <b>hard</b> <b>clipping,</b> the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|E

The point of the SIT is that it behaves like a triode but at lower voltages and higher currents, so it doesn't need a matching transformer to deliver power to 8 Ohms. Like tubes, SITs have soft overload clipping. When brief bursts of musical energy occur, SITs react with rounded waveform tops instead of sharp and <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> of solid-state.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} design and {{evaluation}} of an embedded optimization framework for the perceptual enhancement of audio signals which are degraded by linear and/or nonlinear distortion. In general, audio signal enhancement has the goal to improve the perceived audio quality, speech intelligibility, or another desired perceptual attribute of the distorted audio signal by applying a real-time digital signal processing algorithm. In the designed embedded optimization framework, the audio signal enhancement problem under consideration is formulated and solved as a per-frame numerical optimization problem, allowing to compute the enhanced audio signal frame that is optimal according to a desired perceptual attribute. The first stage of the embedded optimization framework consists {{in the formulation of}} the per-frame optimization problem aimed at maximally enhancing the desired perceptual attribute, by explicitly incorporating a suitable model of human sound perception. The second stage of the embedded optimization framework consists in the on-line solution of the formulated per-frame optimization problem, by using a fast and reliable optimization method that exploits the inherent structure of the optimization problem. This embedded optimization framework is applied to four commonly encountered and challenging audio signal enhancement problems, namely <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> precompensation, loudspeaker precompensation, declipping and multi-microphone dereverberation. The first part of this thesis focuses on precompensation algorithms, in which the audio signal enhancement operation is applied before the distortion process affects the audio signal. More specifically, the problems of <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> precompensation and loudspeaker precompensation are tackled in the embedded optimization framework. In the context of <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> precompensation, an objective function reflecting the perceptible nonlinear <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> distortion is constructed by including frequency weights based on the instantaneous masking threshold, which is computed on a frame-by frame basis by applying a perceptual model. The resulting per-frame convex quadratic optimization problems are solved efficiently using an optimal projected gradient method, for which theoretical complexity bounds are derived. Moreover, a fixed-point hardware implementation of this optimal projected gradient method on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows the algorithm to be capable to run in real time and without perceptible audio quality loss on a small and portable audio device. In the context of loudspeaker precompensation, an objective function reflecting the perceptible combined linear and nonlinear loudspeaker distortion is constructed in a similar fashion as for <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> precompensation. The loudspeaker is modeled using a Hammerstein loudspeaker model, i. e. a cascade of a memoryless nonlinearity and a linear FIR filter. The resulting per-frame nonconvex optimization problems are solved efficiently using gradient optimization methods which exploit knowledge on the invertibility and the smoothness of the memoryless nonlinearity in the Hammerstein loudspeaker model. From objective and subjective evaluation experiments, it is concluded with statistical significance that the embedded optimization algorithms for <b>hard</b> <b>clipping</b> and loudspeaker precompensation improve the resulting audio quality when compared to standard precompensation algorithms. The second part of this thesis focuses on recovery algorithms, in which the audio signal enhancement operation is applied after the distortion process affects the audio signal. More specifically, the problems of declipping and multi-microphone dereverberation are tackled in the embedded optimization framework. Declipping is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem where the recovery is performed by solving a per-frame l 1 -norm minimization problem, which includes frequency weights based on the instantaneous masking threshold. As a result, the declipping algorithm is focused on maximizing the perceived audio quality instead of the physical signal reconstruction quality of the declipped audio signal. Comparative objective and subjective evaluation experiments reveal with statistical significance that the proposed embedded optimization declipping algorithm improves the resulting audio quality compared to existing declipping algorithms. Multi-microphone dereverberation is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem, allowing for the joint estimation of the clean audio signal and the room acoustics model parameters. It is shown that the nonconvex optimization problem can be smoothed by including regularization terms based on a statistical late reverberation model and a sparsity prior for the clean audio signal, which is demonstrated to improve the dereverberation performance.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the impact of gesturing when learning from instructional animations. Theoretical considerations derived from embodied cognition (Glenberg, 2008) and cognitive load theory (Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011) underpinned the study. A second aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether the expected positive effects of gesturing were subject to the expertise reversal effect (see Sweller et al., 2003). A musical task (playing the piano) was chosen because it met two important criteria. Playing the piano is a form of human movement that requires the use of hands, and therefore was expected to be particularly suited to learning from animated presentations. Playing the piano can be mimicked using the hands and therefore was expected to particularly suited to gesturing. Two hypotheses were tested: 1 : Gesturing would lead to greater learning than non-gesturing 2 : There would be an interaction between gesturing and expertise Method and procedure Fifty university students from an Australian University were assigned randomly to one of two gesturing conditions in a 2 (gesturing vs. non-gesturing) x 2 (novice vs. more experience) factorial design. The learning materials consisted of a series of four piano clips of increasing difficulty. Each clip showed the hands of a musician playing the musical extracts, and in perfect synchronization the sounds made by the piano were heard. Participants viewed each animation clip individually twice and after each clip were asked to play the musical piece on a piano. The gesturing group were required to make gestures when viewing the animations, and the non-gesturing group were not. Results For clips 2 [p <. 001] and 3 [p <. 01] the gesturing group had significantly higher scores than the non-gesturing group. Furthermore, the gesturing group experienced significantly less difficulty than the non-gesturing group on for clips 1 [p <. 01], 2 [p <. 001], and 3 [p <. 001]. These results provide support for Hypothesis 1, as when gesturing participants scored higher and experienced less difficulty. For clip 1 only, a significant interaction was found [p <. 05]. Simple effects tests indicated that for the novice group, gesturing led to significant higher scores than non-gesturing (p <. 05). However, for the more experienced group no significant difference was found. Hence, the only support for hypothesis 2 was found on clip 1. However, for the novice group a significant advantage for gesturing was found on clips 1 (p <. 05) and 2 (p <. 01), but not for clips 3 and 4. For the more experienced group, there was a significant gesturing advantage for clips 2 (p <. 01) and 3 (p <. 05) but not for clips 1 & 4. These results suggest that as the tasks got more difficult gesturing lost its advantage. Conclusion It can be concluded that the effectiveness of the gestures was moderated by both task complexity, where gestures were most useful for tasks that were of a moderate level of difficulty, and expertise, where more expert piano players found gestures to be redundant for the easier clips, and more useful for the <b>harder</b> <b>clips,</b> while novices found the gestures to be useful for the easier clips, but not for the more difficult ones.
