25|$|The Packers were {{scheduled}} to retire Favre's #4 jersey in a ceremony {{during the first week}} of the season. However, on July 2, 2008, he publicly indicated that he wanted to play again as the starting quarterback. On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers management asking for an unconditional release which will allow him to play for another team. The Packers did not <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but they were unwilling to release him for fear that he would sign with division rival Minnesota Vikings (Favre's choice for an alternate team). Also, the Packers would not start him as quarterback if he came back to the team, and named the other Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback and Favre as the backup.|$|E
25|$|Darine contrives a ruse to win Sir Ethais's love. She {{tells him}} that Sir Phyllon had accused him of exaggerating the {{severity}} of his wound, {{so that he could}} avoid fighting again.

2500|$|The Ring {{remained}} hidden on {{the river}} bed for almost {{two and a half}} millennia, until it was discovered on a fishing trip by a Stoor hobbit named Déagol. His friend and relative Sméagol, who had gone fishing with him, was immediately ensnared by the Ring's power and demanded that Déagol <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as a [...] "birthday present"; when Déagol refused, Sméagol strangled him and took it for himself. The Ring corrupted his body and mind, turning him into the creature known as Gollum. The Ring, which Sauron had endowed with a will of its own, manipulated Gollum into hiding in a cave under the Misty Mountains near Mirkwood, where Sauron was beginning to resurface. There Gollum remained for nearly 500 years, until the Ring tired of him and fell off his finger as he was hunting an orc.|$|E

2500|$|Rowley also {{fought in}} the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Due to the heavy loss of life at Shiloh, General Grant was {{strongly}} criticized in many Northern newspapers.

After learning that Wallace refused to obey anything but written orders, an angry General Grant asserted that a division general ought to take his troops to wherever the firing may be, even without orders", and first sent Rowley, ordering him to [...] "tell him to come up at once" [...] and that [...] "if he should require a written order of you, you will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at once", while also instructing Rowley to make sure he brought writing materials.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of alchemy in the Chinese civilization, it {{was seen as an}} art. Among many practitioners, there were a {{significant}} number of women who mastered this art. The earliest recorded woman alchemist had the family name of Fang (...) , and she lived about around the first century B.C. Being raised in a scholarly family who were skilled in the alchemical arts, she was able to have studied alchemy with one of the Emperor Han Wu Ti's spouses, and therefore had access to the highest levels of society. Fang was credited with the discovery of how to turn mercury into silver. It was believed that she may have used the technique of silver extraction from ores using mercury, the pure silver residue is left behind from the boiled mercury. Fang's husband, Chheng Wei (...) , physically abused her, because he was trying to obtain the secret procedure from Fang, but she refused to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> With the constant contact with mercury, Fang eventually went insane and killed herself, most likely due to mercury poisoning.

Rowley, ordering him to [...] "tell him to come up at once" [...] and that [...] "if he should require a written order of you, you will <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at once". When Rowley caught up to where Wallace's division last was, there was only a supply wagon departing the scene. Riding on further Rowley found Wallace at the head of his column near Clear Creek, positioned on high ground. Rowley pulled Wallace off to the side and warned him of the danger that lied just ahead, exclaiming, [...] "Don't you know that Sherman has been driven back? Why, the whole army is within half a mile of the river, and it's a question if we are not all going to be driven into it." [...] Wallace, stunned by the news, sent his cavalry ahead to assess the situation, and upon returning, it had confirmed Rowley's claim.|$|E

I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight."
