40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} case of an International Development Association (IDA) {{assisted}} rural water supply and sanitation project in Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan, to raise some important questions about how donor-assisted projects are administered in developing countries. The paper analyzes some unusual findings from the project related to issues of central control (both by donors and the implementing public agency), institutional learning, project innovations, and political involvement in development projects. Typically, development projects are characterized by highly inflexible project rules, lack of interaction between senior and junior staff, inadequate cooperation amongst technical and community mobilization staff, and widespread political interference, all of which are perceived to be impediments to project success. The <b>IDA</b> <b>project</b> recognized these problems and instituted several important project innovations to overcome them.

40|$|The {{field was}} the {{curation}} of new media within large-scale exhibition practice for Chinese audiences. The context was improved {{understandings of the}} intertwining cultures and concerns of Chinese and Western contemporary practitioners. The research uncovered a range of connective and dialogical concerns around cultural displacement and re-identification, germane to the chosen group of media artists. The methodology was principally practice-led. The research brought together 31 practitioners from Asian, European and Australasian cultures within a major highly visible Chinese exhibition context. By identifying and promoting a distinct commonality within difference amongst the diverse practitioners the exhibition successfully activated a global dialogue that incorporated environmental and cultural identity agendas within a major Chinese educational and public context - thereby promulgating cross-cultural understanding, despite the often oppressive shadowing of domestic political processes. The project was developed under the international aegis of <b>IDA</b> <b>Projects</b> (established since 1999) and was substantially supported by the Fine Art Department of the Beijing Film Academy, QUT Precincts and Platform China Art Institute. It built upon IDA’s 2005 inaugural new media exhibition at the ‘Today Art’ Museum in Beijing – now recognised {{as one of the}} leading art spaces in China. Numerous peer-reviewed grants won included the Australian Embassy in China and the Australia China Council.

We offer an Individual Development Account (IDA). The participants' savings are matched with grant dollars raised in the IDA statewide initiative. Participants are accepted from the refugee and immigrant population resettled in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire (US). Participants save for home purchase, and while doing so receive individual counseling with their same-language mentor, the English-speaking community volunteers, and project director. Participants receive group training on the specifics of home buying and financial literacy (of American systems) through the Homeownership Center of a local non-profit agency working on affordable housing, the Laconia Area Community Land Trust. We evaluated the success of this project by determining the asset accumulation of participants each year; completing their IDA saving plan by purchasing a home and also by ongoing participation and savings rate.

40|$|The {{field was}} the {{curation}} of cross-cultural new media/ digital media practices within large-scale exhibition practices in China. The context was improved {{understandings of the}} intertwining of the natural and the artificial with respect to landscape and culture, and their consequent effect on our contemporary globalised society. The research highlighted new languages of media art with respect to landscape and their particular underpinning dialects. The methodology was principally practice-led. [...] - The research brought together over 60 practitioners from both local and diasporic Asian, European and Australian cultures {{for the first time}} within a Chinese exhibition context. Through pursuing a strong response to both cultural displacement and re-identification the research forged and documented an enduring commonality within difference – an agenda further concentrated through sensitivities surrounding that year’s Beijing’s Olympics. In contrast to the severe threats posed to the local dialects of many of the world’s spoken and written languages the ‘Vernacular Terrain’ project evidenced that many local creative ‘dialects’ of the environment-media art continuum had indeed survived and flourished. [...] - The project was co-funded by the Beijing Film Academy, QUT Precincts, IDAProjects and Platform China Art Institute. A broad range of peer-reviewed grants was won including from the Australia China Council and the Australian Embassy in China. Through invitations from external curators much of the work then traveled to other venues including the Block Gallery at QUT and the outdoor screens at Federation Square, Melbourne. The Vernacular Terrain catalogue featured a comprehensive history of the <b>IDA</b> <b>project</b> from 2000 to 2008 alongside several major essays. Due to the reputation IDA Projects had established, the team were invited to curate a major exhibition showcasing fifty new media artists: The Vernacular Terrain, at the prestigious Songzhang Art Museum, Beijing in Dec 07 -Jan 2008. The exhibition was designed for an extensive, newly opened gallery owned by one of China's most important art historians Li Xian Ting. This exhibition was not only this gallery’s inaugural non-Chinese curated show but also the Gallery’s first new media exhibition. It included important works by artists such as Peter Greenway, Michael Roulier, Maleonn and Cui Xuiwen. [...] - Each artist was chosen both for a focus upon their own local environmental concerns as well as their specific forms of practice - that included virtual world design, interactive design, video art, real time and manipulated multiplayer gaming platforms and web 2. 0 practices. This exhibition examined the interconnectivities of cultural dialogue on both a micro and macro scale; incorporating the local and the global, through display methods and design approaches that stitched these diverse practices into a spatial map of meanings and conversations. By examining the contexts of each artist’s practice in relationship to the specificity of their own local place and prevailing global contexts the exhibition sought to uncover a global vernacular. Through pursuing this concentrated anthropological direction the research identified key themes and concerns of a contextual language that was clearly underpinned by distinctive local ‘dialects’ thereby contributing to a profound sense of cross-cultural association. Through augmentation of existing discourse the exhibition confirmed the enduring relevance and influence of both localized and globalised languages of the landscape-technology continuum...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that lifelong learning is a form of asset accumulation, this paper discusses a range of financing strategies. The paper includes a summary of what has been learned about assets, both from research and demonstrations largely centered in the U. S. While the evidence strongly suggests that assets are worth accumulating for both economic and social reasons, this begs the question, how can the poor possibly accumulate assets? To answer this question, we closely examine the U. S. experience with Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), which has demonstrated the potential of the poor to save and build assets. One of the key insights arising from <b>IDA</b> demonstration <b>projects</b> is that “savings is a structure, not a habit, ” which has many profound implications for financing lifelong learning—namely, that, absent new, targeted institutional arrangements provided by the public and private sectors, asset and lifelong learning strategies directed at disadvantaged persons are not likely to succeed. The experience of Individual Learning Accounts and other asset building efforts also provide a foundation for a set of broad public policy recommendations...|$|R

50|$|Farming {{practices}} towards tea and cloves {{had increased}} for subsistence farmers. By 1974 ujaama {{programs and the}} IDA (International Development Association) worked hand in hand; while villagisation organized new villages to farm, the <b>IDA</b> financed <b>projects</b> to educate farmers to grow alternate crops and granted loans to farmers with added credit to small farmers (Whitaker 206). For example, only 3 tons of tea had been produced in 1964 yet by 1975, 2,100 tons of tea was the net output of smallholder farmers mostly by Nyerere's policies have given the communal villages the opportunity to grow tea leaves despite {{the long history of}} tea being only grown in estates (208). Although these statistics come from the late 1970s, one may understand agricultural growth through reorganising traditional farms and investing into non-staple agriculture (especially through educating farmers how to grow tea and improve farming methods. One may look upon another example of Tanzanian government's extensive services in training farmers to grow tobacco and improve farming methods, which aided significantly in tobacco yields 41.9 million pounds in 1975-1976. By 1976, Tanzania became the third-largest tobacco cultivator in Africa (207). Therefore, when the Tanzanian government used extensive services in agriculture, they achieved positive results and crop yields' growth, especially in tea and tobacco smallholder farming whose prices are cheaper for Tanzanian villages to consume than purchase products within the cities.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology and a toolset {{to design and}} validate electronic business transactions {{in the context of}} public administrations. The toolset makes use of a subset of formally defined UML, enriched by the notion of 1 st order logic business rules, to model and simulate end-to-end transactions in a interactive way. It is argued that the soundness and the appropriateness of electronic transactions can be improved by allowing the future users themselves – as opposed to the IT analysts involved in the modeling of the transaction- to validate the correctness of the transaction flow and the messages exchanged before they are implemented. To achieve this objective, the UML models are transformed into a workflow-based transaction simulation, or animation, that the future users can use to validate their correctness.

During {{this phase of the}} project, special provisions (SPs) were developed that required RICM technologies on three hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlay pilot projects in Iowa. The field results are presented for each project. The bid item cost for implementing the RICM-HMA SPs on each project varied from 0. 9 % to 1. 4 % of total project cost. The SP on US 30 Harrison County project required RICM roller coverage including temperature, pass count, and compaction measurements on one break down roller. The SP on US 20 <b>Ida</b> County <b>project</b> required RICM roller coverage including temperature and pass count on one break down roller. The SP on IA 9 Kossuth County project required roller pass count coverage for all compaction equipment. The SPs were successfully implemented on US 30 and US 20 projects and the information from the RICM rollers conveniently met the requirements of the SPs for roller coverage. The IA 9 project encountered problems with roller data storage/export during construction leading to not meeting the coverage requirements of the project SP. Testing was conducted on each project by the Iowa State University research team beyond the requirements of the project specifications to analyze asphalt density, RICM values, and asphalt surface temperature changes with pass count and time. Comparisons between RICM values and asphalt density/percent compaction yielded poor correlations, but relationship with falling weight deflectometer modulus values revealed good correlations. Influence of the foundation support conditions under the asphalt surface layer is a major contributor to characterizing correlations between RICM measurements and asphalt density measurements. Geostatistical analysis of pass coverage information revealed differences in pass coverage uniformity between projects. The key benefits of implementing RICM technology for HMA overly projects are documenting the pass coverage/uniformity and the compaction-time-surface temperature history. Future research should be conducted to evaluate this technology on full-depth HMA projects...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Masters in Procurement and Supply Management, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. In 1999, WB and ADB conducted joint review of the country portfolio procurement performance and prepared an action plan for government on public procurement. The World Bank {{in agreement with the}} Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has prepared the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in 2002 and identified several deficiencies in the procurement system of the GoB. As per recommendations of the CPAR, the GoB established a procurement policy unit within the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) under planning ministry. GoB then issued “The Public Procurement Regulations 2003 ” in September 2003 for streamlining the process and to ensure unified procurement systems for government’s departments as well as autonomous, semi-autonomous bodies and corporations. In July’ 2006 GoB then enacted “The Public Procurement Act, 2006 ” (PPA 2006) and consequently in January’ 2008 issued “The Public Procurement Rules, 2008 ” (PPR 2008) to ensure transparency and accountability in the procurement of goods, works and services using public funds. On the other hand, the world bank guidelines are used for the procurement under <b>IDA</b> financed <b>project.</b> The objectives of the research was to study the effectiveness of the procurement course of actions in LGED under IDA and GoB funded projects as well as to find out the factors affecting procurement management systems and to suggest for further enhancement of the procurement process. The methodology of this research was a combination of literature review, questionnaire survey, key informants interview and secondary data collection from project offices. The major literatures that reviewed are world bank procurement guidelines, PPA 2006, PPR 2008, website documents, different procurement journals and reports. The questionnaire survey data were collected from 30 different levels LGED officials as well as from 8 contractors and 2 consultants. The major findings in this research are; Tender Notices floated as per Rule 61 (4) of PPR 2008 keeping sufficient time for the preparation and submission of tenders from the date of advertisement on the basis of official estimated costs. 93 % and 87 % of TER approved within specified timeframe for GoB funded IRIDP <b>project</b> and <b>IDA</b> financed RTIP II project respectively. The main reasons for time extension is due to fund flow crisis, shortage of labour, price hike of construction materials and natural calamities delay works. The main causes for contract variation are scope of work change, faulty estimate preparation and design variation. Barriers for proper contract implementation are; lack of commitment both PEs and contractors, lack of knowledge on procurement processing for the PE’s staffs, massive tender documents, lack of Procurement Effectiveness in LGED Page vi training and development, political influences, lack of knowledge of the contractors and their staffs, attitudal problems, fund flow crisis and so on related issues. 100 % respondents commented that introduction of e-procurement system increased efficiency and decreased malpractices in the procurement process. It is observed that IDA financed RTIP II project is better performing than GoB funded IRIDP project because of better fund flow, extensive monitoring & supervision systems, application of donor’s compliances and so on related issues. Major suggestions provided by the researcher for effective implementation of the procurement process are; Publication of user friendly simplified tender documents, Strict applications of the procurement rules and regulations, Estimate should be prepared more cautiously to avoid variation order preparation, Time extension should be discouraged by applying liquidated damages, Ensuring training and development both for PE’s staffs as well as for contractor’s concern personnel for adapting them in effective procurement practices, Ensuring governance and internal control for making it more effective, Introducing reward system for better performance and punishment for poor performance for effective implementation of the contracts, Ensuring extensive use of e-procurement systems to increase efficiency, transparency and quick processing.

The goal of that project is to design and develop a hardware and software system {{that is capable of}} transforming, in real-time, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals (signals retrieved in a non-invasive way from surface electrodes placed over the user's head) into specific commands such that the user gains reliable control over a computer application or a device. In this dissertation, control over a computer application will be represented with "Brain-Gaming", i. e. simple computer games like Ping-Pong, Pacman or Tetris. To this end, substantial considerations were made on the design and realization of a communication interface and its corresponding protocol. A further important component of every control operation is its strategy and the control alphabet, i. e. the command set. For this purpose, several control strategies were developed, implemented and proved experimentally in different scenarios. The most important aspect of the design and development of these interfaces turned out to be their flexibility. Control over a device could include the steering and moving of a wheel-chair for paralyzed patients or the gaining of control over an arm or foot prosthesis for patients with amputated limbs. The latter was realized here as a computer-based simulation of a virtual limb (e. g. arm), such that it can be tested in future experiments on patients with amputated limbs. In contrast to the "Brain-Gaming" experiments, where the player was equipped with an additional communication channel (one that exists independently of normal communication channels of the human neuromuscular system), the experiments with patients did not require an ultra-fast recognition of the intended movement; i. e. the command signal for a simulated movement can be recognized after the phantom movement is initialized and performed. In experiments with feedback scenarios, which can be resembled as competitive games, several aspects of ultra-fast movement detection could be investigated with reaction tests. This opens new perspectives for the execution of preventive actions in time-critical applications. This dissertation, and {{the development and implementation of}} the prototype, is based on well-founded insights into human neurophysiology; one chapter will deal exclusively with these insights. Moreover, a special chapter of this dissertation will also describe the development and implementation of an online prototype of the BBCI system (Berlin Brain-Computer Interface) from the software engineering viewpoint. A number of bio-feedback modules, for gaming and for rehabilitation purposes, were developed within this work and will be presented in detail. Special attention was paid to the influence of the online bio-feedback on the user's behavior...|$|R
