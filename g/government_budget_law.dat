Kemmerer, a [...] "Money Doctor", {{was invited}} to Chile in 1925 to deal with {{monetary}} policy and inflation problems which were {{considered one of the}} principal economic problems of Chile at the time. The visit by Kemmerer was used to back up monetary policies already outlined by Chileans. These reforms included the creation of a central bank, the establishment of <b>government</b> <b>budget</b> <b>law</b> and a general bank law. All these reforms were established by rule by decree by Arturo Alessandri who had been reestablished in power following a coup d'etat against him in 1924 (where the coup-makers protested among other things against inflation). Gold convertibility was established in 1925. As result of these reforms Chile managed to tame inflation to such degree that the 1920s were the decade with less inflation in the 1890-1980 period. Another concequence of the reforms was an increased easyness by Chile to obtain loans not only in the United States but also in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Germany. In the years after the visit of Kemmerer there was a sharp increase in foreign investments.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the challenges facing}} Albania''s fiscal policy following the graduation from the IMF programs. It argues that Albania''s public debt remains too high {{and needs to be}} reduced. Strengthening the fiscal framework, including by introducing a numerical fiscal rule, could help achieve this objective. The paper discusses two alternative rules, with the objective of achieving a gradual decline in the public debt ratio. One rule would limit nominal expenditure growth, with a correction mechanism to guard against revenue slippages and other shocks. An alternative rule would limit the growth in nominal public debt.

Emphasis {{is given to the}} need to establish effective and accountable medium-term budget frameworks to establish policy credibility and anchor adjustment programs to meet EU fiscal goals. Adoption of budgeting and accounting standards consistent with the IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 framework will also help link budget decisions to EU standards of fiscal reporting. More consistent and comprehensive coverage of off-budget activities is needed for assessing fiscal risk and sustainability. Finally, local government issues need to be addressed by many of these countries since EU fiscal goals are set with reference to general government. Progress in all of these areas can be monitored by keeping fiscal ROSC assessments up to date.

A significant part of the shortfall reflected a shift to a chain-weighted methodologyâ€”growth on the old methodology was 3. 6 percent. Pressure on labor markets from job shedding is slowly abating. Progress in corporate restructuring continues. Cash flow and profits remain buoyant; bankruptcies have fallen to a 10 -year low and leverage continues to decline.
