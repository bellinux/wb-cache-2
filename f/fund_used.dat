However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government.

2500|$|While the <b>fund</b> <b>used</b> {{existing}} {{hospitals to}} the maximum extent possible, in many mining areas there were no hospitals within reasonable distance of the coal mines, and medical services to coalminers tended to be of inferior quality in those areas. [...] The fund at first paid fees to doctors, {{but the question of}} unnecessary and incompetent surgery soon arose publicly. [...] Draper wrote in 1953, [...] "As there were no indications that the deplorable conditions of the past would not extend indefinitely into the future, the fund had no other recourse than to arrange for the establishment of new hospitals in some of the areas in which [...] most desperate need existed." [...] This need led to the establishment of the Memorial Hospital Associations of Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, and the building of ten new hospitals. [...] These associations were non-profit organizations established in accordance with the respective laws of the individual states, and were financed through a production royalty on coal tonnage.|$|E
