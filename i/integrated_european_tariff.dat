40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{sensitivity}} of total factor productivity (TFP) to foreign competition in the case of a European country. Using the Olley and Pakes method, we calculate the TFP of Spanish manufacturing firms and study the impact of EU tariffs and the presence of foreign products and imports on TFP at the firm level. Applying the System-GMM method, we find that TFP is negatively impacted by <b>European</b> <b>tariffs,</b> whereas competition in the form of the increased presence of foreign products in the domestic market and firm imports leads to improvements in the TFP. Moreover, these two effects are complementary. We also find evidence of important asymmetries among firms depending on their involvement in foreign markets. Copyright 2009 The Authors.

40|$|In 1879 Germany imposed {{tariffs on}} a wide variety of {{industrial}} and agricultural goods. The German “iron and rye ” tariff marked a turning point in nineteenth-century <b>European</b> <b>tariff</b> history: the decades preceding it were characterized by trade liberalization while the following decades were characterized by a return to protectionism in continental Europe. This paper challenges the leading political-economy explanations for the adoption of the tariff that focus on the effects of a decline in European grain prices on Germany’s income distribution. Instead it claims that severe macroeconomic imbalances caused by the Franco-Prussian War indemnity played the crucial role in the rise of protectionism in Germany in the 1870 s and in the eventual adoption of the tariff. * For their help I would like to thank Guillaume Daudin, Avner Greif, Debbie Johnston...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} {{oriented}} by two goals. First, it aims to measure the magnitude of thetariff used by the European Union (EU) on the agricultural products. Second, it triesto identify the existence of tariff discrimination among the groups of agriculturalproducts in the <b>European</b> <b>tariff</b> set. The hypothesis {{is that there is}} tariff discriminationin the EU agricultural tariff schedule. Theoretical and empirical studies have alreadysuggested that there are groups of products particularly protected by the EU agriculturaltariffs. The present work has one main contribution: the discussion related to theeffects of using different prices to the conversion of EU specific and composed tariffs. The study points to certain sets of agricultural products targeted by the EU trade policy:especially meat, sugar, residues and waste from food industries; and, at second,tobacco, meat preparations, cereals, cocoa and preparations, cereal preparations, dairyproducts, and organic quimical products. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to advance {{the understanding of the}} impacts of trade and domestic policies on production, trade, welfare, and productivity. The first chapter summarizes and extends the New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) literature by showing that the cost function specification plays a crucial role in identifying the market power parameter in both autarky and trade models. The second chapter uses a strategic trade policy framework and the NEIO literature to analyze the oligopolistic competition between U. S. and Chinese apple exporters in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in their domestic apple markets. A theoretical model is defined and quantitative results are derived for changes in ASEAN tariffs on imports of U. S. and Chinese apples and the latter countries' subsidies. A structural econometric model is estimated and simulated to quantify the effects of changes in the tariffs and subsidies on trade flows, price, and welfare. The third paper develops a strategic trade model based on the new trade theory to analyze competition between Florida and São Paulo processors in the U. S. orange juice market and São Paulo processors in the European orange juice market. Comparative static results are derived to analyze the effect of a reduction in the U. S. and <b>European</b> <b>tariffs</b> on sales and welfare in the United States, São Paulo, and Europe. A structural econometric model is specified, and the NEIO literature is utilized to identify the market power parameters. The estimated structural model is simulated to quantify a reduction in the U. S. and <b>European</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The fourth chapter analyzes the short- and long-run effects of various subsidies by developing a dynamic general equilibrium model with firm-level productivity shocks and endogenous entry and exit. Measurement statistics are specified for welfare, real gross domestic product, and total factor productivity to make the analysis resemble the data-based measurements macroeconomist typically implement. The model is calibrated to a general and widely accepted set of functional forms and parameters. The impacts of the elimination of subsidies are quantified by numerically solving the model for both steady state values and equilibrium transition paths for the above measurement statistics.
