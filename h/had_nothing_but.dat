5|$|Gellibrand {{was sent}} to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom as Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to Major General James Whiteside McCay. McCay was known as a hard task master, but he <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> praise for the work of Gellibrand, who helped him {{overhaul}} the organisation and the training syllabus. Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command. In April 1918, the brigade was committed to battle {{in the path of the}} advancing German Army in the Battle of Dernancourt. The brigade held and defeated the German advance.|$|E

500|$|Despite these difficulties, {{the agents}} {{collected}} 150,000 documents, {{in addition to}} a number of government files, which the agency judged to be useful. The CIA received assistance in collecting these from Castillo Armas's junta, and from the Guatemalan army. The haul was described as the [...] "greatest catch of documents ever left behind by a Communist Party and its auxiliaries." [...] Most of these <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> [...] "local significance." [...] Although no documents were discovered demonstrating Soviet influence, the CIA hoped to use the large number of papers to show that the communists in Guatemala had had a large influence over the government, through institutions like labor unions, peasant organizations, student unions, and youth groups.|$|E

[...] However, the album's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo's choice of [...] "Hash Pipe" [...] as the first single. Citing the song's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that [...] "Don't Let Go" [...] be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and [...] "Hash Pipe" [...] eventually became the album's first single.

500|$|In 2014, Farrell {{starred in}} a film {{adaptation}} of Mark Helprin's Winter's Tale. The film was {{written and directed by}} Akiva Goldsman and based on Helprin's 1983 novel, and co-starred Jessica Brown Findlay, Russell Crowe, and Will Smith. Farrell won the lead role over younger actors Garrett Hedlund, Tom Hiddleston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Although the film generally received negative reviews due to the overly romantic nature of the film, writers such as The Village Voices Stephanie Zacharek <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> praise for Farrell. She described him as [...] "an extraordinary appealing actor" [...] who [...] "has always made a terrific bad boy, but ... seems to be settling into some very serious, responsible-adult roles." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, writing that the actor [...] "holds the movie together" [...] and is part of [...] "the most beautiful [...] so far of 2014." ...|$|E

Kumagai had also expressed his hope that the screenplay would be compelling both to fans {{of the game and}} those new to the [...] series. From the visual perspective, the original character designs of the game were completely revamped for the film by animation director Keisuke Watabe, who retained the characters' likeness. The various Personas and Shadows were designed by Kyouma Aki while art direction was handled by Toshihiro Kohama. Kaoru Aoki aided with the art designs while Junpei Takatsu {{was in charge of the}} visual designs. Saori Goda held the position of color coordination while Shinobu Tsuneki designed the film's props. Other staff directors included the executive animation directors Akiko Asaki and Mizuka Takahashi, action director Ryo Tanaka and composite director Hideki Imaizumi. Finally, Takashi Sakurai served as the film's editor.|$|E
500|$|English {{novelist and}} critic Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Observer that once Carl finds Dominic and Danny, the novel [...] "loses {{momentum}} and becomes more didactic", {{and that the}} [...] "sheer exuberance of detail ... at times threatens to overwhelm the story". But overall she {{was impressed with the}} book, saying that it is [...] "a big, old-fashioned novel in the best sense". Joanna Scott wrote in The New York Times that she liked the sensory sensations Irving evoked in the book, in particular those brought on by Dominic's cooking. She also found some of the book's comical scenes, including the naked female skydiver landing in a pigpen, [...] "among the most memorable that Irving has written". Writer and critic Alan Cheuse in The Dallas Morning News enjoyed the book. He found the flight of the father and son a [...] "brilliant plot device", and was fascinated by the details of the restaurant business and the process of writing novels. [...] "As a writer, I <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> admiration for Irving's modern version of the old flight and revenge motif." ...|$|E
500|$|In the B story, Andy (Chris Pratt) still pines for April (Aubrey Plaza), {{who remains}} angry at Andy {{and is now}} dating the {{handsome}} Eduardo (Carlo Mendez). Chris (Rob Lowe) suggests Andy tap into the aspects of his personality April was attracted to in the first place. However, the only things he can think of are that he is nice and {{he is in a}} band. Andy decides to be nice to Eduardo, and the two realize they have similar musical tastes (they both like the Dave Matthews Band) and end up bonding over a guitar session. April becomes frustrated because she only dated Eduardo to make Andy jealous. She dumps Eduardo, which Chris interprets as a sign that his efforts are succeeding. Ann (Rashida Jones), who was nervous about Andy and Chris spending time together, is relieved when Chris tells her that Andy <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> positive things to say about her. The episode ends with the Pawnee residents [...] including Kelly and his daughter [...] watching an outdoor screening of the Twilight film.|$|E

500|$|The 1948 Detroit Tigers {{season began}} with Houtteman in the {{starting}} rotation. Things started off poorly, however, as Houtteman lost his first eight decisions. Two of the first five losses, though, were by one run, and he had little run support. The 0–8 start and lack of run support led to his being called [...] "Hard Luck Houtteman" [...] in the media. His first victory that year came against the Senators, in which he also drove in the winning run. After winning his next start, he defeated the Philadelphia Athletics allowing only five hits, and avoided another loss. But he then lost eight more games and finished the season at 2–16. His teammates and the media attributed this to bad luck rather than bad pitching, and still regarded him as a prime prospect. Newhouser said, [...] "The kid has <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> bad luck since the season opened", while Fred Hutchinson said, [...] "He shouldn't have lost more than three or four games had he gotten an even break". But his 4.66 ERA was only 0.06 higher than the major league average.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics like health and ability cooldowns, but {{spoke of a}} disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between the screen and the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game". He {{went on to say that}} players will look to see the technology spread to other miniature wargaming products.|$|E
500|$|The worst {{cells for}} {{confinement}} as a punishment for inmates who {{stepped out of}} line were located {{at the end of}} D-Block in cells 9–14, known as [...] "The Hole". The cells were devoid of light and colder {{than the rest of the}} prison, and prisoners sent here were regularly stripped, beaten, and tortured and often starved, forced to sleep on the cold concrete floor wearing nothing but light underwear. In turn, guards were abused, and often had faeces, urine or food thrown at them or were spat at. Inmates held in the hole were limited to just one 10-minute shower and an hour of exercise in the yard a week. The five cells of [...] "The Hole" [...] <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a sink and toilet and the very worst cell was nicknamed [...] "The Oriental" [...] or [...] "Strip Cell", the final cell of the block with nothing but a hole in the floor as a toilet, in which prisoners would often be confined naked with nothing else for two days. The guards controlled the flushing of the toilet in that cell. A hatchway in the floor on D-Block also led to the dungeon in the basement which contained several cells. The worst behaved inmates would be locked inside their cells in the dungeon, chained to the walls. They were given a meager diet of bread and water each day, and one regular meal every three days, although the quantity and duration often varied relative to the extent of the punishment. Denied of proper toilet facilities, they were given a bucket as a toilet, emptied once a week, and stripped and chained to the wall standing at nights; according to Alvin J. Esau, prisoners in solitary confinement were [...] "placed on a starvation diet and made to stand nine hours each day with hands tied and their feet barely touching the floor." [...] After completing the punishment in the hole, the prisoner could then return to his cell but be tagged; a red tag, third grade, denoted a prisoner who was restricted from leaving his cell for perhaps 3 months. At second grade the prisoners could receive letters, and if after 30 days they remained behaved, they would then be restored full prison privileges.|$|E
