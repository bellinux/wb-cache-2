40|$|AbstractThe {{stacking}} of <b>cold</b> <b>antiprotons</b> {{is currently}} {{the only way to}} accumulate the large numbers of the <b>cold</b> <b>antiprotons</b> that are needed for low energy experiments. Both the largest possible number and the lowest possible temperature are desired, especially for the production and study of <b>cold</b> antihydrogen. The <b>antiprotons</b> accumulated in our particle trap have an energy 1010 times lower than the energy of those delivered by CERN's Antiprotons Decelerator (AD). The number accumulated (more than 0. 4 million in this demonstration) is linear in the number of accepted high energy antiproton pulses (32 in this demonstration). Accumulation efficiencies and losses are measured and discussed...|$|R
