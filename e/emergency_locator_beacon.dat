25|$|There were {{fears that}} the plane's {{tracking}} equipment and <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> could have been damaged after the crash or weakened by interference, and that this would hamper the search. The head of the National Search and Rescue Agency told the Associated Press that he believed the aircraft was probably lost at sea. From 5 January 2007, {{the main focus of}} the search was relocated to areas south of Manado, after Manado's Sam Ratulangi Airport reported detecting a signal from the plane a day before. However, the rugged terrain coupled with thick and low hanging clouds continued to hamper the search efforts, and three relatives of missing passengers who overflew part of the area on a military reconnaissance plane admitted that the chances of finding the plane were slim. Officials said that it was unlikely any bodies had survived in one piece. On 14 January, at Indonesia's request, Singapore sent four towed underwater locator beacon detectors, sometimes called Towed Pinger Locators, and six consultants in their use to aid in the search. These would successfully locate the black boxes. On 24 January, the British ship MN Endeavour joined the search. The ship is operated by local mining firm PT Gema Tera Mustikawati and is usually used by oil and gas drilling companies to map the seabed. By 24 January, the Indonesian government had spent an average of Rp 1 billion (about US$110,000) a day on the search.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{techniques}} potentially useful to data collection have been tested. An automatic data collection platform with a minicomputer collects and preprocesses data, then sends desired information when interrogated through a communication satellite. Position surveillance by tone-code ranging through communication satellites is automatic, real time and accurate. Emergency medical data transmissions from ambulances to hospitals {{can be extended}} to rural and remote areas by direct satellite links. A small platform can send emergency-related data through a satellite while the satellite is routinely relaying powerful communication signals.

50|$|On {{the third}} day after the disappearance, sixteen ships, a {{submarine}} and six aircraft were deployed {{to search for the}} missing An-32 in the Bay of Bengal, about 150 nautical miles east of Chennai. On 1 August, it was confirmed that the aircraft had no underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> (ULB). It did have two <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> Transmitters (ELTs).|$|R
50|$|EPIRBs are {{tracking}} transmitters which aid in {{the detection}} and location of boats, aircraft, and people in distress. A PLB (personal locator beacon) is particular type of EPIRB that is typically smaller, has a shorter battery life and unlike a proper EPIRB is registered to a person rather than a vessel. The terms ELB (<b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>beacon)</b> and ELT (emergency locator transmitter) are used interchangeably with EPIRB only when used on aircraft. Strictly, they are radiobeacons many of which interface with worldwide offered service of Cospas-Sarsat, the international satellite system for search and rescue (SAR). Transmitters broadcasting on 406 MHz are recognized. When manually activated, or automatically activated upon immersion or impact, such beacons send out a distress signal. The signals are monitored worldwide {{and the location of}} the distress is detected by non-geostationary satellites using the doppler effect for trilateration, and in more recent EPIRBs also by GPS.|$|E

5000|$|On 26 May, it was {{reported}} that signals from the aircraft's <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> transmitter had been detected by satellite, which narrowed the area where the main wreckage was likely to be located on the seabed to within a radius of 5 km. An <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> transmitter usually activates at impact to send a radio distress signal; this is not the signal from an underwater <b>locator</b> <b>beacon</b> (ULB) attached to a flight recorder, which is an ultrasonic pulse. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> transmitter signal was received by satellites minutes after the airliner disappeared from radar. A [...] "distress signal" [...] received two hours after the disappearance of the aircraft, possibly originating from the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> transmitter, had been reported already on 19 May; this report was denied by EgyptAir.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) uses newer {{technology}} and has expanded capability relative to the predecessor GOES series of satellites. The satellite directly transmits day and night observations of hemispheric-scale weather, hurricanes, and other more localized severe storms and relays processed high-resolution observation data along with weather facsimile (WEFAX) data. Weather observations are generated in the visible and infrared spin scan radiometer (VISSR) atmospheric sounder (VAS). The VAS performs visible and infrared imaging as well as multispectral imaging (MSI) and temperature sounding of the atmosphere. The satellite provides direct interrogation and simultaneous relay transmission between the command data acquisition station (CDAS) and the multiple, widely dispersed data collection platforms (DCP). The satellites also monitor {{the condition of the}} earth's magnetic field, energetic particle flux, and X-ray emissions from the sun. The satellite performs all communications functions by means of a multifunction communications system that operates on S-band and uhf frequencies at rates varying from 100 bit/s to 28 megabit/s. An experimental capability for the detection of the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> transmitter <b>beacons</b> is included in the GOES-GH design {{as a part of the}} international satellite-aided search and rescue system...|$|R
