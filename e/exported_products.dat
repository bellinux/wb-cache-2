Commercial navigation began with steamboats in the 19th century to transport ores, lumber, passengers and other imported and <b>exported</b> <b>products</b> between the Kootenay River valley and the Canadian Pacific Railway station at Golden, British Columbia. Boat travel on the upper river ceased when a rail line was built along the Kootenay upstream of the big bend. Steamboats also operated briefly on the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the transformation of}} <b>export</b> <b>product</b> portfolios of highly successful exporters. Food manufacturers from a developing country (Greece) are investigated. Using an in-depth exploratory design involving {{a limited number of}} cases, it looks more precisely at the composition of product portfolio at initiation and development of <b>exports,</b> new <b>product</b> development for <b>exports</b> and <b>export</b> <b>product</b> elimination. Among the main findings, the foreign (FMD) versus domestic (DMD) market dependence of the focus exporters had a major effect in the transformation of the <b>export</b> <b>product</b> portfolios, FMD exporters carried out adaptations to a greater extent and developed more products than DMD exporters. Small FMD exporters seemed to lag in <b>export</b> <b>product</b> innovativeness and initiated exports with lower differentiation-pricate label in contrast with DMD firms which developed exports with higher differentiation own branded products. Furthermore, new <b>product</b> development for <b>exports</b> was irregular and diverged from formal incremental development. Last, but not least, <b>export</b> <b>product</b> elimination is much different from its counterpart in domestic marketing. Six different categories of export elimination may be distinguished. Five incidents of <b>export</b> <b>product</b> elimination falling in three categories were identified. Precipitating circumstances varied for each category.

Controls on the association of physical locations to well-known <b>exported</b> <b>products,</b> e.g. wine from the Champagne and Bordeaux regions of France, tin-glazed earthenwares from certain cities in Holland, lace from Chantilly, etc., helped to establish a town's place in global commerce — this led to modern trademarks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Are US exports {{different}} from China's exports? If so, how? This article attempts {{to answer this}} question, using product-level manufacturing import data from Japan. To make the comparison clear, this article also examines exports from the EU. The results indicate that more than 85 per cent and 83 per cent of <b>products</b> <b>exported</b> by the US and the EU, respectively, to Japan are also commonly exported from China. Both the US and the EU <b>export</b> <b>products</b> are priced higher than China's <b>export</b> <b>products,</b> regardless of industries. This result suggests that quality differences matter in explaining the high overlap of China's <b>export</b> <b>products</b> with US and EU <b>export</b> <b>products.</b> In some industries, however, the price differences of US and EU exports relative to China's exports are relatively small. This result implies that either Chinese firms are upgrading {{the quality of their}} products, or US and EU firms are improving their efficiencies such that they can compete with Chinese firms.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{theoretical and empirical}} analysis {{on the effects of}} one-sided trade liberalization on firms’ <b>export</b> <b>product</b> scope. The model explicitly incorporates the cost of managing production and sales in addition to the usually-modeled production cost. The analysis predicts that the home country’s tariff cut reduces all home firms’ <b>export</b> <b>product</b> scope; whereas in response to the foreign country’s tariff cut, a home firm’s <b>export</b> <b>product</b> scope expands (shrinks) if the firm’s management cost is low (high), independent of the firm’s production cost. These predictions are confirmed by our empirical analysis based data of Chinese firms from 2000 to 2006. postprin...|$|R
