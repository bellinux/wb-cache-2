5000|$|... 1000 years ago, the Strega {{appeared}} in the small country of Zamuel. These Strega possessed mysterious powers, and passed their knowledge {{to the people of}} Zamuel, transforming the poor country into a prosperous nation. They bestowed upon them mystical objects, known as Jeno, which would enable ordinary humans to <b>exercise</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> their own. However, the Strega underestimated the overwhelming drive of human ambition and greed. With this new power, the people of Zamuel would invade their neighboring lands. In no time, the entire continent transformed itself into a world of destruction and death.|$|E

50|$|The Banking Board was {{established}} in 1932 by N.Y.S. Banking Law § 13 and 14, and was a quasi-legislative body. The Banking Board was created to advise and cooperate with the Banking Department {{in the formulation of}} banking standards and regulations and <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> approve or disapprove the issuance of bank charters and licenses and the establishment of branch banks. The Board's powers were broad and affected many aspects of banking supervision.|$|R
50|$|In canon law, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> {{govern the}} church is divided into the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> make laws (legislative), enforce the laws (executive), and to judge based on the law (judicial). A person <b>exercises</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> govern either because the person holds an office to which the law grants {{governing}} power or because someone with governing power has delegated it to the person. Ordinary power is the former, while the latter is delegated power. The office with ordinary power could possess the governing power itself (proper ordinary power) or instead it could have the ordinary power of agency, the inherent <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> someone else's <b>power</b> (vicarious ordinary power).|$|R

The chapter continues by going through {{the history of}} Corresponding Societies until settling on that this ultimately became an education for domestication.|$|R

He refused permission for a visiting amateur theatre group to perform Howard Brenton's play Christie in Love and required changes to the staging of a production of Shakespeare's Coriolanus by the Tricycle Theatre Company to prevent an actor's naked buttocks being visible to the audience. On several occasions, however, 'he suggested that the role of chief censor should not lie with him, but should be at taken on by the elected members of the States'.|$|R
50|$|This well-accepted law of redress {{justified}} {{a people}} resisting unconstitutional acts of government. Liberty depended upon the people’s “ultimate” right to resist. Unconstitutional commands breaching the “voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled” could be “ignored” and arbitrary commands opposed with force. This right implied a duty {{on the part}} of the people to resist unconstitutional acts. As Alexander Hamilton noted in 1775, government <b>exercised</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> protect “the absolute rights” of the people and government forfeited those powers and the people could reclaim them if government breached this constitutional contract.|$|R

It was during this King's reign that Parliament clearly separated into two distinct chambers: the House of Commons (consisting of the shire and borough representatives) and the House of Lords (consisting of the bishops and abbots and the peers). The authority of Parliament continued to grow, and, during the early fifteenth century, both Houses <b>exercised</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> an extent not seen before. The Lords were far more powerful than the Commons because of the great influence of the great landowners and the prelates of the realm.|$|R
