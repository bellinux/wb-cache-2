She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|He pursued his {{literary}} goals by submitting {{poetry and prose}} to various newspapers and magazines, partly due to <b>encouragement</b> <b>from</b> Professor Thomas Cogswell Upham.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{patterns}} of political participation offline and online and, using data from an online survey of UK respondents, seeks {{to determine the extent}} that internal motivations (personal gratifications), external motivations (self-efficacy) are factors which influence these patterns. Additionally we determine whether communication via social media from political parties, campaign organisations or friends have a mediating influence on motivations. Our data suggests that there remains a divide between the online and offline spheres of participation, there are also divisions over who participates within each sphere, although the demographic variables are diminishing in their explanatory power. Largely internal motivations, relating to personal feelings have the greatest explanatory power, though external motivations are not insignificant in the offline sphere. However <b>encouragements,</b> particularly <b>from</b> campaign organisations, have a strong mediating effect. <b>Encouragements</b> <b>from</b> friends have a lower impact while political parties appear to struggle to mobilize their supporters reflecting a general trend away from engagement in electoral politics...|$|R
5|$|A pagan {{backlash}} against Christianity followed Æthelberht's death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus {{to flee to}} Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of <b>encouragement</b> <b>from</b> Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes that both letters were general statements of encouragement to the missionaries.|$|E

In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach. With <b>encouragement</b> <b>from</b> community activists in south Minneapolis, the Minneapolis city government hired Dworkin and MacKinnon to draft an antipornography civil rights ordinance as {{an amendment to the}} Minneapolis city civil rights ordinance.|$|E
5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from {{independent}} game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and <b>encouragement</b> <b>from</b> Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E

Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up.

He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E
