It asks what is understood by PSB andexamines critically the arguments for PSB. The latter is done under fiveheadings, namely diversity, democracy/equality, network externalities,innovation and investment and public braodcasting as ``insurance''. The paperthen provides some statistical analysis of the extent, funding and programmemix of Eurepean PSB. Finally it examines in some detail the issues surroundingthe licence fee as an instrument for funding PSB. These include thedetermination {{of the level of}} the fee, collection costs and evasion and thefairness of the instrument.

40|$|Removing {{user fees}} could improve service {{coverage}} and access, in particular among the poorest socio-economic groups, but quick action without prior preparation {{could lead to}} unintended effects, including quality deterioration and excessive demands on health workers. This paper illustrates the process {{needed to make a}} realistic forecast of the possible resource implications of a well-implemented user <b>fee</b> removal <b>programme</b> and proposes six steps for a successful policy change: (1) analysis of a country's initial position (including user fee level, effectiveness of exemption systems and impact of fee revenues at facility level); (2) estimation of the impact of user fee removal on service utilization; (3) estimation of the additional requirements for human resources, drugs and other inputs, and corresponding financial requirements; (4) mobilization of additional resources (both domestic and external) and development of locally-tailored strategies to compensate for the revenue gap and costs associated with increased utilization; (5) building political commitment for the policy reform; (6) communicating the policy change to all stakeholders. The authors conclude that countries that intend to remove user fees can maximize benefits and avoid potential pitfalls through the utilization of the approach and tools described...|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of BEAM in reducing dropout rate {{was carried out in}} Mberengwa North Cluster. The sample size had five school heads,ten school teachers, five School Development Committee Chairperson, ten Community Selection Committee (CSC) members and thirty OVCs at school, which were selected at five different schools. Thirty parents and thirty orphans and vulnerable children from the communities surrounding the school were also chosen for the study. Questionnaires were administered to the teachers and the school heads. Interviews were conducted {{on the rest of the}} research participants. The study found out that there is still a problem of drop out prevailing in Mberengwa district and the BEAM programme is failing to address the issue. The study established that BEAM is a school <b>fees</b> assistance <b>programme</b> only. It does not provide other necessities for the children to learn like food, transport and stationary. The selection criteria are also subjective in some instance because there are some pupils who are benefiting from the BEAM programme who are neither poor nor vulnerable. The study recommends that the BEAM programme should be an inclusive approach that should not only pay for school fees but also cater for the students needs especially the safety needs like food, good shelter, and clothing...|$|R

40|$|The University of East London (UEL) {{offers a}} BSc and MSc of Public Health (PH). The {{programmes}} {{are designed to}} build the workforce capacity by enabling {{access to higher education}} (HE) for future PH practitioners and specialists, and facilitating promotion possibilities within current employment. In 2009 / 10, the MSc and BSc programs had 143 and 70 students respectively, with 209 students undertaking PH combined degrees at the BSc level. This paper presents methods and outcomes of aligning the programs with the United Kingdom Public Health Skills and Career Framework (UK PHSCF). The realigned MSc programme is a 1. 5 year (full-time), six module (180 credits) programme with strong emphasis on epidemiology and research. The BSc programme lasts three years (full-time) and consists of 36 modules (360 credits) providing an introductory overview of the core functions of PH. The programmes’ modules were mapped against the 9 UK PHSCF PH areas. Additional activities were built into the programs to enhance the learning experience and augment transferable skills. After the realignment, the UK Government published in 2010 the White Paper for PH and, in spite of this, announced budget cuts to HE funding along with increased tuition <b>fees.</b> The <b>programme</b> changes are likely to contribute to PH capacity building but in a time when political reform adversely impacts {{on the development of the}} PH workforce...|$|R

50|$|Students in most {{junior colleges}} and {{centralised}} institutes pay subsidised school fees of 6 SGD {{and up to}} 22 SGD per month for other miscellaneous equipment and special <b>programme</b> <b>fees,</b> depending on the status and programmes offered by the college. However, certain independent junior colleges, such as Hwa Chong Institution and Raffles Institution (Junior College), will require new students to pay fees of SGD 300 per month. Scholarships and bursaries are provided for students whose score falls within the 95th percentile from the O-levels, and for students requiring financial assistance. Under these schemes, they are only required to pay an amount equivalent to the school fees of a non-independent junior college. Bursary holders are required to pay {{a fraction of the}} full fees, based on their family income. A student whose household salary is SGD 2000 (75% of an average Singapore household income) is required to pay 75% of the full school fees, while another whose household income is less than SGD 1000 per month has only to pay 25%. There are also MOE pre-university scholarships awarded to academically able students who choose to pursue and specialise their education at a junior college, providing yearly scholarship allowance and remission of school fees. These scholarships include the Pre-University Scholarship, which provides a scholarship allowance of SGD 750 per annum, as well as specialised scholarships such as the Humanities Scholarship, Art Elective Programme Scholarship, Language Elective Programme (French, German & Japanese) Scholarship and Music Elective Programme Scholarship which provide scholarship allowances of SGD1000 per annum in addition to a remission of school fees as well as additional grants for overseas trips or programmes (ranging from SGD 1,000 to SGD 2,000).|$|R
40|$|When the UK Government {{introduced}} a fee level {{at the point}} of entry for Home students on undergraduate programmes, the debate was focused upon widening participation into higher education. That debate was to be settled empirically but the aspect of the intervention tending to be overlooked was the effect on access to postgraduate study for those shouldering greater debt and unable to pay it off at this stage. There has been for a long time a semi-market in postgraduate <b>programme</b> <b>fees.</b> Research council funded research students are a small minority. Most find other means of support and many choose the part-time study option. Fees for part-time study have for a long time varied across the sector, where less popular institutions' subject areas see the need to loss-lead to ensure a critical mass of research-active individuals. Since the mid- 1990 s, the research councils have shifted resources relatively into research degree programmes and away from taught masters programmes, making it harder to study at higher degree level in subjects less "job-marketable", and making more room for fee levels above economic cost for more job-marketable programmes. And all this is without considering the International postgraduate student dimension, concerning which there has been more variation in fee levels, tending towards an implicit "cash cow" policy to hold up the postgraduate infrastructure of institutions. Overall, the situation within the postgraduate domain is and has been highly complex, but the increasing market trend, strengthened by the non-market action of the research councils, sees higher fee levels and higher proportions of International postgraduates and others who can find the financial means, concentrated in Russell Group institutions rather than elsewhere. This presentation responds to the symposium by providing a perspective on this situation via HESA data and a snap survey of the student experience. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} 			objectives of {{this study}} were; to examine and calculate the total 			and average costs of each selected item, to calculate student 			opportunity costs, to analyse student satisfaction with programme, 			to analyse the cost effective measures taken by academicians for 			each of three programmes and to assess eleven years admissions and 			completion and to analyse main objectives of programmes. 			It was descriptive study based on analysis and comparison of B. Ed 			programme at Bangladesh Open University (BOU), B. Ed at Allama Iqbal 			Open University (AIOU) Pakistan, and degree level/SI teacher 			training programme at University Terbuka (UT) Indonesia. It used a 			simple non-linear input and output design of economic approacH of 			cost effectiveness analysis. The instruments that were developed to 			collect data about costs and other relevant features of programme 			were questionnaires. There were two questionnaires. The first 			questionnaire was administered to the management of programme. The 			elements in first questionnaire were 			 1 -Enrolment, 2 -completion, 3 -costs of examinations, 4 - costs of 			radio and television transmissions, 5 -course presentation costs 			(tutorial and workshop), 6 - costs of printed material, 			 7 -departmental/ establishment costs, 8 - cost of building meant for 			this programme in the main campus of university, 9 - objectives of 			programme and analyses about achievement of objectives, 			 10 -benrolment and completion since 1992 to 2002. 			The selected output variables for cost-effectiveness analysis were; 			(a) Completion rate (b) Student satisfaction with programme. (C) 			The most important objectives of each selected programme were 			analyzed separately. Independent variables for data analysis were 			university, gender, age, qualification {{at the time of}} admission, 			profession and who paid the opportunity cost of students. The 			dependent variables for data analysis were student satisfaction 			with programme and studentopportunity cost. 			The purpose to add some queries about the preliminary information 			was to obtain some of background knowledge about programme. 			Unit cost per pupil was the criteria for cost effectiveness 			analysis. The cost function applied for data analysis was; 			Unit cost = Fixed cost + Variable costs / N 			The results showed that enrolment was the highest at AIOU during 11 			years. The highest average costs of examination were; 93. 36 (UT), 			costs of course presentation were 93. 46 (UT), costs of printed 			material were 98. 97 (BOU), and departmental costs were 78. 76 (BOU). 			Radio and television department produced programmes for students of 			BOU. Average cost of broadcast media was. 851 at UT. As far as unit 			cost per student is concerned it was the lowest at AIOU. The mean 			scores of total opportunity costs were 411 for UT, 227 for BOU and 			 458 for AIOU. Student satisfaction with programme was highest at 			UT and lowest at BOU. The result showed that unit cost was lowest at 			AIOU and programme was the most cost effective due to economy of 			scale. 			Income from <b>fee</b> of each <b>programme</b> and item wise costs should be 			maintained in documents so that the assessment and comparison of 			programme may be feasible for management and researchers. The cost 			of examination is high at UT as compared to the other two 			universities. It is better to work out to lower down the cost of 			examination at UT.
