5|$|The {{downloadable}} add-on Citadel adds {{a number}} of character moments for Tali, including (depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her) revealing her love of romantic movies, her talent for singing and doing impressions of the Normandy, and the fact she cannot <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> liquor very well.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{university}} in June 1913, Wilkinson became a paid worker for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913, {{when more than}} 50,000 women marched {{from all over the}} country to a mass rally in Hyde Park, London.

5|$|Scully {{discusses}} {{her research}} with Mulder, suspecting that L'Ively is the arsonist; this {{is confirmed by}} a police sketch taken from the witness' description. Upon reaching the Marsdens' house, Mulder and Scully find the driver's charred body in the bathroom before the second floor bursts into flames. Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> fire when L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house.

5|$|The god Vishnu and his consorts Lakshmi and Bhudevi {{should be}} {{represented}} as taking {{the place of}} Parvati's parents in the ceremony. The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which he pours water over the hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to the groom. He holds his usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, stand behind Parvati and <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} that summer, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that she was too frail to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating {{back to the days of}} the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal kāhili fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.|$|E

5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings are {{thrown into the}} air and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to <b>hold</b> <b>her,</b> but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

25|$|Western artists adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} scriptural stable to the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both.

25|$|Sinn Féin made a {{breakthrough}} in the Dublin constituency in 2004.

In the 2009 election, when Dublin's representation was reduced to three MEPs, she failed to <b>hold</b> <b>her</b> seat. In the South constituency their candidate, Councillor Toiréasa Ferris, managed to nearly {{double the number of}} first preference votes, lying third after the first count, but failed to get enough transfers to win a seat.|$|E
