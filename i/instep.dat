5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or <b>instep.</b> The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and <b>instep.</b> Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
5|$|On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson's former camp at Gilbert Town, where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them, {{anxious for}} action. On October 6, they reached Cowpens, South Carolina, (site {{of the future}} Battle of Cowpens), where they {{received}} word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him. Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men. Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day's march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements. Kings Mountain {{is one of many}} rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow <b>instep,</b> and a broad rounded toe. The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle, the highest point on Kings Mountain.|$|E

25|$|Character {{shoes are}} leather shoes with one- to three-inch heels, usually {{with one or}} more straps across the <b>instep</b> to secure it to the foot. They may be soft-soled (suede) or hard-soled. They may be {{converted}} to tap shoes by attaching taps.|$|E
25|$|Flat {{shoes were}} worn to around 1610, when a low heel became popular. The ribbon tie over the <b>instep</b> that had {{appeared}} on late sixteenth century shoes grew into elaborate lace or ribbon rosettes called shoe roses that were {{worn by the}} most fashionable men and women.|$|E

25|$|Ballet flats, {{known in}} the UK as ballerinas, ballet pumps or skimmers, are shoes with a very low heel and a {{relatively}} short vamp, exposing much of the <b>instep.</b> They are popular for warm-weather wear, and {{may be seen as}} more comfortable than shoes with a higher heel.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} types. One is like an {{oversize}} shoe or low boot made of thick rubber with a heavy sole and <b>instep,</b> designed for heavy-duty use. The other one is of much thinner, more flexible material, more like a rubber slipper, designed solely for protection against the wet rather than for extensive walking.|$|E

25|$|Roman infants {{were usually}} swaddled. Apart from those few, {{typically}} formal garments reserved for adults, most children wore a scaled-down {{version of what}} their parents wore. Girls often wore a long tunic that reached the foot or <b>instep,</b> belted at the waist and very simply decorated, most often white. Outdoors, they might wear another tunic over it. Boy's tunics were shorter.|$|E
25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} <b>instep</b> is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|E
25|$|Engineer {{boots are}} {{typically}} made from thick, stiff, full-grain bull hide. The leather is often oiled to add durability and flexibility, {{and may be}} brown or black in color. The double-layered shafts may be anywhere between 7 inches to 17 inches in height, and are gusseted {{at the top and}} relatively loose, though they can be tightened by a steel-buckled strap. Another steel-buckled strap is placed at the <b>instep</b> of each boot. As per their rugged construction, the footwear is relatively heavy and weighs approximately a pound-mass each.|$|E

25|$|Proper {{technique}} {{is also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high <b>instep</b> or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E

He used to write as {{a columnist for the}} leading Pakistani newspaper, The News International, where he wrote the weekly political opinion editorial column, The Pakistan Report Card and the pop culture criticism column titled His Bigness in the <b>Instep</b> segment of the Sunday edition. He wrote a bi-weekly light humour diary column in the weekly magazine The Friday Times under the heading, Man Friday. As a writer some of his prominent themes have included bringing back rationality into civil dialogue, political satire, debunking conspiracy theories that affect the national discourse in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the <b>instep,</b> then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|E
50|$|The Alger sits at {{the corner}} of Warren Avenue and Outer Drive. It is {{constructed}} of structural steel faced with brick. A two-story square-plan tower structure with an <b>instepped</b> parapet stands at the corner, dominating the building's facade. The tower houses the theater entrance and box office. A vertical sign with the theater's name extends from the tower toward the street. Along the Warren facade, four single-story commercial spaces faced with painted yellow brick line the sidewalk; the facade of the theater proper above is set back.|$|R
25|$|The {{birth of}} the modern pointe shoe is often {{attributed}} to the early 20th-century Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, {{who was one of}} the most famous and influential dancers of her time. Pavlova had particularly high, arched <b>insteps,</b> which left her vulnerable to injury when dancing en pointe. She also had slender, tapered feet, which resulted in excessive pressure on her big toes. To compensate for this, she inserted toughened leather soles into her shoes for extra support and flattened and hardened the toe area to form a box.|$|R

Her night-gowns were of most sorry pattern till her aunt came; thereafter they were clean, though it mattered little. They were a nuisance anyway.|$|R
40|$|Tungstate and {{molybdate}} based {{metal oxides}} with substituted Eu 3 + based phosphors are promising red emitting phosphor materials for white LEDs. In the present research, {{a series of}} novel red phosphors including La 2 GdBWO 9 as a host and doped La 2 Gd 0. 9 Eu 0. 1 BW 1 -xMoxO 9 (x = 0 – 0. 4, <b>insteps</b> of 0. 1) samples were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction. The phase formation and transformation of the synthesized compositions was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, DRS studies and photoluminescence properties were studied {{as a function of}} the Mo/W ratio. All the compositions show broad charge transfer (CT) band due to CT from O to W/Mo and red emission due to Eu 3 + ions. Eu 3 + substituted compositions show high red emission intensity under NUV/blue ray excitation as well as the emission of the phosphor shows very good CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) chromaticity coordinates (x = 0. 6647, y = 0. 3349). Band gap of La 2 Gd 0. 9 Eu 0. 1 BW 1 -xMoxO 9 (x = 0 – 0. 3, <b>insteps</b> of 0. 1) becomes narrower than that of host La 2 GdBWO 9 by introducing Mo 6 +.
