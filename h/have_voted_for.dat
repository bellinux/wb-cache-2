5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of voters would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E

25|$|In February 2005, the We Youth Movement, {{a member}} of The Other Russia coalition, started a {{campaign}} to promote Konni for President. It was {{the opinion of the}} group that no matter who won the 2008 Russian Presidential election the operating Head of State would remain the same, and hence Konni would make the best candidate. Georgy Satarov, a key member of The Other Russia, believed that if Putin were to have endorsed Konni as his successor, then 40% of the electorate would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> the Labrador, given that 40% of the people would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> whomever Putin endorsed for the election.|$|E

After 1763 he was in Ireland and Minorca, returning to Scotland in 1789. He ran into financial troubles, and his cousin Sir Alexander Livingston-Campbell of Ardkinglas had him imprisoned for debt, as he believed that Callander <b>had</b> not <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> him in the election and <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Callander's friend Sir Thomas Dundas.

25|$|Whether {{or not the}} {{election}} meddling of the NIS by way of online posts has actually affected {{the outcome of the}} presidential election is controversial.

Dean argued that Nader {{would be more effective}} if he lobbied on election law reform issues during his campaign. Dean supported several election law reform issues such as campaign finance reform, and Instant Runoff Voting.|$|E

25|$|Whitman was re-elected in 1997, {{narrowly}} defeating Jim McGreevey, {{the mayor}} of Woodbridge Township, who criticized Whitman's record on property taxes and automobile insurance rates. McGreevey also criticized Whitman for allowing a private sector company to administer the vehicle inspection program. In the 1997 election, the early prediction was that Whitman, as an incumbent, would have an easy win. The result, however, was that Whitman duplicated her 1993 election with only a one-point victory and a plurality of the votes. Murray Sabrin, a college professor who ran as a Libertarian candidate, and finished third with {{five percent of the}} vote, received votes mostly from conservative Republicans who might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Whitman.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 result made Barack Obama {{the first}} Democratic presidential nominee to sweep all 10 of New Hampshire's counties. Obama even won a {{majority}} of the vote in traditionally staunchly Republican Carroll County, the only county in New Hampshire (and in all of New England) to <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Republican Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Democratic landslide. This is despite Obama's 10-point margin being considerably lower than Lyndon B. Johnson's 28-point margin. Carroll County had not given a majority to a Democratic presidential nominee since 1888, although vote-splitting last allowed Woodrow Wilson to win a plurality there in 1912. As of 2017, this is the last election in which Rockingham County, Belknap County, and Carroll County voted for the Democratic candidate.|$|E
