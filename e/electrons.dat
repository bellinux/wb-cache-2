5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 <b>electrons,</b> {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence <b>electrons</b> may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner <b>electrons</b> with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence <b>electrons</b> will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d <b>electrons</b> lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s <b>electrons</b> would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 <b>electrons,</b> {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost <b>electrons</b> {{in the sixth}} shell are valence <b>electrons.</b> Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few <b>electrons</b> are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 <b>electrons,</b> forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 <b>electrons.</b> The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 <b>electrons</b> are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s <b>electrons</b> are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence <b>electrons.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 <b>electrons</b> are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer <b>electrons</b> are valence <b>electrons.</b> Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three <b>electrons</b> as valence <b>electrons,</b> as afterwards the remaining 4f <b>electrons</b> are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more <b>electrons,</b> with the other atom gaining the <b>electrons,</b> resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and <b>electrons</b> are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically brittle.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electrons</b> are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting <b>electrons</b> {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including <b>electrons,</b> is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two <b>electrons</b> are swapped; that is, , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second <b>electrons,</b> respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E

5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more <b>electrons</b> bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the <b>electrons</b> have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and <b>electrons</b> are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer <b>electrons</b> than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E

The outer <b>electrons</b> are ineffective at nuclear shielding, and experience a high effective nuclear charge of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.|$|E
40|$|When an <b>electron</b> swarm in gas is {{composed}} of component <b>electron</b> swarms individually in drift equilibrium, the higher-order diffusion coefficients (HDCs) of the composite <b>electron</b> swarms are equal {{to those of the}} component <b>electron</b> swarms. We have derived this equality theoretically and have examined it by numerical simulation. The HDCs are the time derivatives of higher-order cumulants, which are quantities characterizing the shape of a spatial <b>electron</b> distribution. This fact seemingly indicates the dependence of the HDCs of the composite <b>electron</b> swarms on the arrangement of the component <b>electron</b> swarms. However, the equality holds irrespective of the relative positions and <b>electron</b> populations of the component <b>electron</b> swarms. We have given a consistent explanation to these facts.

5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer <b>electrons</b> than are {{required}} to balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of <b>electrons,</b> the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer <b>electrons</b> than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of <b>electrons</b> and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting <b>electrons</b> result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two <b>electrons</b> from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of <b>electrons.</b> For example, it causes groups of bound <b>electrons</b> to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|Independent <b>electrons</b> {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free <b>electrons.</b> <b>Electrons</b> in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the {{particles}} that are commonly termed <b>electrons</b> in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real <b>electrons</b> but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E

5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three <b>electrons</b> as valence <b>electrons,</b> as afterwards the remaining 4f <b>electrons</b> are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of <b>electrons</b> to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence <b>electrons.</b> Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight <b>electrons.</b> This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer <b>electrons</b> are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in which its valence <b>electrons</b> are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E

5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full valence {{electron}} shells. Valence <b>electrons</b> are the outermost <b>electrons</b> of an atom and are normally the only <b>electrons</b> that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose <b>electrons.</b> However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer <b>electrons</b> from heavy noble gases.|$|E
5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of <b>electrons</b> is quantized. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that {{is proportional to the}} {{angular momentum}}.
