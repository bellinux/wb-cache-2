5|$|To escape racial discrimination, his {{children}} passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter {{lived with a}} brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African-American doctor were rediscovered by 20th-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants {{in the twenty-first century}} when a three-times-great-granddaughter took a history class and found his name in her grandmother's <b>family</b> <b>bible.</b> In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.|$|E

The tombstone was donated in 1947 by two out-of-town railroad enthusiasts who accidentally got his birth year wrong. Until then, a simple wooden cross had marked his grave.|$|E

25|$|But {{despite these}} achievements, by 1964 the {{memorial}} still wasn't finished. More than 150,000 {{people a year}} were visiting the memorial, but the Washington museum was still unfinished. A major push to finish the museum came after 1966, when Washington's descendants—Anne Madison and Patty Willis Washington—donated the Washington family's collection of papers and memorabilia to the museum. The donation included a large portrait of George Washington and his family, {{as well as the}} Washington <b>family</b> <b>Bible.</b> Only after this donation was made were funds for the museum's completion finally raised.|$|E
25|$|Before {{it was a}} lake, White Rock Lake was a {{collection}} of farms owned by the Daniel and Cox families. The first record of the Daniel family farm is in the <b>Family</b> <b>Bible</b> of Thomas Walker Daniel. He and his wife Frances Herndon Daniel seem to have moved to the White Rock area in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Daniel's son had a good friend {{during the civil war}} named Cox. When the war was over, the Cox family moved to land adjacent to the Daniel family. Together they had a joint family cemetery called the Daniel-Cox Cemetery. Other pioneer families such as the Humbards, the Glovers, Lavenders, McCommases, Coxes and Donagheys jointly maintained the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|After {{detention}} in Woking and Aylesbury prisons, Florence Maybrick {{was released}} in January 1904, having spent fourteen years in custody. Although {{she had lost her}} American citizenship when she married her British husband, she returned to the United States. Initially she earned a living on the lecture circuit, protesting her innocence. In later life, after some months spent unsuccessfully as a housekeeper, Florence became a recluse, living in a squalid three-room cabin near Gaylordsville, South Kent, Connecticut with only her cats for company. Few residents had any knowledge of Florence's true identity and the lady who had once charmed Victorian Liverpool died alone and penniless on 23 October 1941, and was buried in the grounds of South Kent School. Among her few possessions was a tattered <b>family</b> <b>Bible.</b>|$|E

500|$|Samuel Turell Armstrong (April 29, 1784 – March 26, 1850) was a U.S. {{political}} figure.

500|$|In 1811 he {{returned}} the business to Boston, establishing a bookshop on Cornhill.

500|$|Barrymore {{was born}} John Sidney Blyth in Philadelphia, and was known {{by family and}} friends as [...] "Jack". Although the Barrymore <b>family</b> <b>bible</b> puts his date of birth as February 15, 1882, his birth {{certificate}} shows February 14. He {{was the youngest of}} three children. His siblings were Lionel (1878-1954), and Ethel (1879-1959). His father was Maurice Barrymore, an Indian-born British actor who had been born Herbert Blyth, and had adopted Barrymore as a stage name after seeing it on a poster in the Haymarket Theatre in London. Barrymore's mother, Georgie Drew Barrymore, was born into a prominent theatrical family. Barrymore's maternal grandparents were Louisa Lane Drew, a well-known 19th-century American actress and the manager of the Arch Street Theatre, and John Drew, also an actor whose specialty was comedy. Barrymore's maternal uncles were two more thespians, John Drew, Jr. and Sidney.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after this deistic upsurge, the Second Great Awakening began. George Spater explains that [...] "the revulsion felt for Paine's Age of Reason {{and for other}} anti-religious thought {{was so great that}} a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America {{before the end of the}} eighteenth century." [...] By 1796 every student at Harvard was given a copy of Bishop Watson's rebuttal of The Age of Reason. In 1815, Parson Weems, an early American novelist and moralist, published God's Revenge Against Adultery, in which one of the major characters [...] "owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'". Paine's [...] "libertine" [...] text leads the young man to [...] "bold slanders of the bible", even to the point that he [...] "threw aside his father's good old <b>family</b> <b>bible,</b> and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story begins}} with a dialog between two characters.

[...] This statement is followed by [...] "Where's the Show" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be a Man". In the medley, Nelson depicts {{the birth of the}} character, who implores God to become a man. The song is followed by [...] "In God's Eyes", depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In [...] "Family Bible", the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the <b>family</b> <b>Bible.</b> [...] "It's Not for Me to Understand" [...] depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E

5000|$|These volumes {{come from}} a period when Books of Hours were {{produced}} for their artistic and decorative effect.
