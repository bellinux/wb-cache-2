5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough <b>fibrous</b> <b>material</b> like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E

25|$|Adhesions, or {{scar tissue}} between various organs {{that are not}} {{normally}} attached within the abdomen, may occur whenever an abdominal surgery is performed. It is often seen secondary to reperfusion injury where there is ischemic bowel or after intestinal distention. This injury causes neutrophils {{to move into the}} serosa and mesothelium to be lost, which the body then attempts to repair using fibrin and collagen, leading to adhesion formation between adjacent tissues with either fibrinous or <b>fibrous</b> <b>material.</b> Adhesions may encourage a volvulus, as the attachment provides a pivot point, or force a tight turn between two adjacent loops that are now attached, leading to partial obstruction. For this reason, clinical signs vary from silent lesions to acute obstruction, encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction or strangulation, and requiring further surgery and risk of adhesion. Generally, adhesions form within the first two months following surgery. Adhesions occur most commonly in horses with small intestinal disease (22% of all surgical colics), foals (17%), those requiring enterotomy or a resection and anastomosis, or those that develop septic peritonitis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fibrous</b> <b>materials</b> are {{promising}} {{for a wide}} range of engineering applications due to their low density and high stiffness and strength. Stochastic filamentous networks can be widely found in biomaterials at the micro- and nano-scales. The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanical properties of macro-sized, micro-sized and nano-sized stochastic fibrous networks with cross-linking. A continuum mechanics-based three-dimensional periodic beam model has been developed to describe stochastic <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials</b> by the Finite Element Method (FEM). Relative density is a key parameter to elucidate the mechanical properties of porous <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials.</b> The relative density of the beam model developed in this study can be adjusted by changing the concentration of the cross-linker, the fibre aspect ratio and the coefficient of overlap. In general, the non-dimensional Young’s moduli and shear moduli increase with increasing relative density. The simulation and analytical model have suggested that strut bending is the dominant deformation mechanism for stochastic <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials.</b> Based on the total strain energy density, scalar measures of characteristic stress and strain have been applied to reveal the yielding of stochastic <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials.</b> The effect of relative density on uniaxial yield strength of stochastic <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials</b> shows a quadratic function in the x direction and a cubic function in the z direction. When the dimensions of fibrous structures are reduced to the micro- or nano-scale, the stiffness is much different from that of their macro-sized counterparts. Strain gradient effects at the micro-meter scale, and the surface elasticity and initial stress effects at the nano-meter scale have been incorporated into the deformation mechanism of <b>fibrous</b> <b>materials.</b> For both of the micro- and nano-sized fibrous structure, the smaller the diameter, the larger the non-dimensional Young’s moduli and shear moduli. Generally speaking, the dimensionless stiffness of nano-sized stochastic fibrous structures is larger than their micro-sized counterparts.

60|$|It must be duly borne in mind, {{to begin}} with, {{that the prime}} end and object of the nut {{is not to be}} eaten raw by the ingenious monkey, or to be {{converted}} by lordly man into coco-nut biscuits, or coco-nut pudding, but simply and solely to reproduce the coco-nut palm in sufficient numbers to future generations. For this purpose the nut has slowly acquired by natural selection a number of protective defences against its numerous enemies, which serve to guard it admirably in the native state from almost all possible animal depredators. First of all, the actual nut or seed itself consists of a tiny embryo plant, placed just inside the softest of the three pores or pits {{at the end of the}} shell, and surrounded by a vast quantity of nutritious pulp, destined to feed and support it during its earliest unprotected days, if not otherwise diverted by man or monkey. But as whatever feeds a young plant will also feed an animal, and as many animals betray a felonious desire to appropriate to their own wicked ends the food-stuffs laid up by the palm for the use of its own seedling, the coco-nut has been compelled to inclose this particularly large and rich kernel in a very solid and defensive shell. And, once more, since the palm grows at a very great height from the ground--I have seen them up to ninety feet in favourable circumstances--this shell stands a very good chance of getting broken in tumbling to the earth, so that it has been necessary to surround it with a mass of soft and yielding <b>fibrous</b> <b>material,</b> which breaks its fall, and acts as a buffer to it when it comes in contact with the soil beneath. So many protections has the coco-nut gradually devised for itself by the continuous survival of the best adapted amid numberless and endless spontaneous variations of all its kind in past time.|$|E
