25|$|In an {{emergency}} {{it is often}} best to try to climb {{on top of a}} strainer {{so as not to be}} pinned against the object under the water. In a river, swimming aggressively away from the strainer and into the main channel is recommended. If it is impossible to avoid the strainer, one should swim hard towards <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get as much of one's body up and over it as possible.|$|E
25|$|To be able {{to provide}} {{military}} assistance to Michael of Wallachia, Sigismund Báthory promised the Székely commoners, who had earlier been reduced to serfdom, to restore their liberties if they joined his campaign on 15September. More than 20,000 Székelys took up arms, enabling Sigismund to muster an army of about 35,000 strong. Although the prince personally led the army to Wallachia, Bocskai was the actual commander of the campaign. After Michael the Brave and Sigismund's other vassal, Ștefan Răzvan of Moldavia, joined the campaign, their united troops laid siege to Târgoviște on 16October. Two days later, Bocskai personally led the decisive attack against the fortress, forcing the Ottoman soldiers to abandon <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to break through the besiegers. The Ottomans were either killed or captured. The Ottoman garrison abandoned Bucharest without resistance and the main Ottoman army retreated to Giurgiu on the Danube. By the time Sigismund's army reached the Danube, most Ottoman soldiers had crossed the river, but those who had stayed behind in Wallachia were massacred on 29October. On the following day, the Ottoman fortress at Giurgiu was also occupied. After returning to Transylvania, Sigismund Báthory revoked his decision about the liberation of the Székelys on 12December.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to hit it away, usually with the {{intention}} of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were to the bowler's advantage. One of the greatest players of the pioneering period was Richard Newland of Slindon and Sussex. In July 1745, he scored 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings as it may have been his match total (there is a parallel here with Small in a 1768 match). If it was one innings, it is the highest individual score recorded during the pioneering period and, for its time, was a very high score which could equate in real terms to a modern triple-century.|$|E

500|$|At Stan's tenth {{birthday}} party, {{his present}} from Kyle {{is the latest}} CD from a [...] "tween wave" [...] band, but Sharon forbids Stan {{to listen to the}} CD and promptly takes it away, enraging him. After Randy argues with Sharon over the matter, he decides to sit down and listen to the CD (which, to the viewer and the adults, is the sound of drum beats and defecation). Randy claims to enjoy the CD, but Sharon does not believe him. As tween wave music becomes popular, Sharon and the other boys' parents forbid them from listening to any of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to play for them The Police's song [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] as an example of what they consider to be good music. To the boys and the viewer, however, it literally sounds like people defecating on the soundtrack, just as the [...] "tween wave" [...] music is presented as sounding to the adults. That night, Stan secretly listens to the confiscated music but discovers, to his confusion, that it now [...] "sounds like shit".|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed the tone of his script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2007, Rogers {{was awarded}} his first {{national}} contract with Cricket Australia. On 13 January 2008, he {{was added to}} the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, who had torn a hamstring, and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the WACA Ground on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat. Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400. His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008. Rogers commented that he [...] "didn't see it coming, I'll have to accept <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to get back in." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
