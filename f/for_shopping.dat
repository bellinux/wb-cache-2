40|$|A {{steady stream}} of {{research}} {{over the past few}} decades has focused on store and shopping mall patronage and consumers’ associated enjoyment of the shopping experience. Based on previous research, the sources of shopping enjoyment were identified as shopping to socialize, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> bargains, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> gratification, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> entertainment, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> others, <b>shopping</b> to browse, <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> exercise and <b>shopping</b> <b>for</b> sensory stimulation. The objective of this study was to investigate gender differences in the sources of shopping enjoyment. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires distributed at a large metropolitan shopping centre in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria. The findings indicate significant gender differences on all the sources of shopping enjoyment except ‘shopping for entertainment’. This study contributes to the current literature and provides valuable information to South African retailers, specifically with regard to marketing and promotional strategies aimed at male and female shoppers separately. Suggestions for future research are offered. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Knowing that Westmoreland and the US Embassy were {{hostile to}} Thi and {{supportive}} of his leadership, Kỳ mustered {{the support of}} eight generals on the 10-man junta, meaning that along with his vote, there were nine officers in favor of Thi's removal. With Thi the only non-supporter, Kỳ and his colleagues removed Thi from the junta and his corps command on 10 March 1966. Thi claimed that during this meeting, knowing the other generals' antipathy to him, he nettled them by chastising {{their commitment to the}} country. He said the populace would never support the generals' war effort as long as they lived so comfortably, and he mocked them for ostentatiously flying their wives and mistresses to Hong Kong <b>for</b> <b>shopping</b> expeditions. The junta put Thi under house arrest pending his deportation from the country, and appointed General Nguyễn Văn Chuân, the erstwhile commander of 1st Division and a Thi subordinate, as the new I Corps commander.|$|E
5|$|The newly {{installed}} French {{colonial government}} promptly exiled Rainilaiarivony to Algiers. Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted {{to remain as}} symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement– the menalamba rebellion– and discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile the queen to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year and shortly thereafter Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living including occasional trips to Paris <b>for</b> <b>shopping</b> and sightseeing. Despite Ranavalona's repeated requests, she was never permitted to return home to Madagascar. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 {{at the age of}} 55. Her remains were buried in Algiers but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina {{on the grounds of the}} Rova of Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|Johor Bahru {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with thousands of Singaporeans and Indonesians and other international tourists visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore as many Singaporeans frequently visit <b>for</b> <b>shopping,</b> entertainment, and dining which increase the city income with the stronger Singapore dollar; some Singaporeans have also chosen to live in the city. Due to this, Johor Bahru's retail scene was continuously developed {{to meet the needs of}} its consumers. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. A large numbers of the city's residents work in Singapore, where the salaries are higher than in Malaysia. The presence of Singaporean and Chinese-owned companies were also significant, with China being the fifth largest investor in Iskandar Malaysia after Singapore, the United States, Spain and Japan as of September 2014. In 2014, the sudden change of weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday by the Sultan of Johor had a relatively small impact to the city economy, with business especially affected. However, it boosted the tourism industry as the holidays would be able to start earlier on Sunday, attracting more tourists from Singapore. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a low-carbon economy.|$|E
