25|$|The Israeli economy {{withstood}} the late-2000s recession, registering positive GDP {{growth in}} 2009 and ending the decade with an unemployment rate {{lower than that}} of many western countries. There are several reasons behind this <b>economic</b> <b>resilience,</b> for example, the fact, as stated above, that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative macro-economic policies. Two policies in particular can be cited, one is the refusal of the government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their risky behavior. The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the banks' depository and investment banking activities, contrary to the then-opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions which had the effect of encouraging more risk-taking in the financial systems of those countries.|$|E

Using a general and stringent definition of “insurance” and a simple ecological-economic model, we derive the economic insurance value of ecosystem resilience and study how it depends on ecosystem properties, economic context, and the ecosystem user’s risk preferences. We show that (i) the insurance value of resilience is negative (positive) for low (high) levels of resilience, (ii) it increases with the level of resilience, and (iii) it is one additive component of the total <b>economic</b> value of <b>resilience.</b> ecosystem, <b>economic</b> value, insurance, <b>resilience,</b> risk, risk preferences...|$|R

By assuming that Transnistria {{is a small}} developing island state, Briguglio’s methodology of juxtaposition of structural <b>economic</b> vulnerability and <b>resilience</b> was employed for the research. A quantitative method of calculating the Economic Vulnerability Index was combined with a qualitative analysis of expert interviews to estimate the structural <b>economic</b> vulnerability and <b>resilience</b> of the separatist republic respectively, and draw conclusions on the region’s economic viability. Also other theoretical and empirical studies on SIDS were utilized to explain the pattern of economic viability under frozen conflict and point to possible implications for the future.

The data also indicates that interest in volunteering has reached extraordinary levels with historic numbers of applications for public programs such as AmeriCorps and Peace Corps.
