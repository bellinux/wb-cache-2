5|$|Born to a Gujarati {{family in}} Vadnagar, Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and later ran his own stall. He was {{introduced}} to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. He left home after graduating from school, partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected. Modi traveled around India for two years, and visited a number of religious centres. He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970. In 1971 he became a <b>full-time</b> <b>worker</b> for the RSS. During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.|$|E

25|$|He {{worked in}} his uncle's {{provision}} shop and {{during this time}} he started joining processions and attending public meetings about the Indian Home Rule Movement. Kamaraj developed an interest in prevailing political conditions by reading newspapers daily. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the decisive turning point in his life, {{and at this point}} he decided his aim was to fight for national freedom and {{to bring an end to}} foreign rule. In 1920, at the age of 18, he became active as a political worker and joined Congress as a <b>full-time</b> <b>worker.</b> In 1921 Kamaraj was organising public meetings at Virudhunagar for Congress leaders. He was eager to meet Gandhi, and when Gandhi visited Madurai on 21 September 1921 Kamaraj attended Gandhi's public meeting and met him for the first time in person. He visited villages carrying Congress propaganda.|$|E

On April 23, 2003, Tiger Mask was booked to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship from then champion Koji Kanemoto. Tiger Mask's first IWGP reign {{came to an end}} in December 2003, when he had to vacate the title due to an injury. Tiger Mask returned with renewed strength and won the 2004 Best of the Super Juniors tournament where he beat the then IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Heat in the semi finals and Koji Kanemoto in the finals to win the annual tournament. It wouldn’t be until 2005 that Tiger Mask was able to recreate his semi final victory to defeat Heat for the IWGP Jr. Heavyweight Title. Tiger Mask also won the 2005 Best of the Super Juniors making him the first and to date only wrestler to win the tournament two years in a row. In October 2005 Tiger Mask lost the title to the fourth incarnation of the Black Tiger gimmick (Rocky Romero). Tiger Mask defeated Black Tiger in a rematch on February 19, 2006, in a match where Black Tiger put both the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship on the line, making Tiger Mask a double champion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} income taxation on the labor supply of part-time and <b>full-time</b> <b>workers</b> in the United States. Using a model that incorporates the endogeneity of the net wage rate and the virtual income, and correcting for self-selection into part-time and full-time jobs, {{the results indicate that}} part-time workers are relatively more responsive to changes in income tax than <b>full-time</b> <b>workers.</b> Estimated wage elasticities are relatively larger for part-time than for <b>full-time</b> <b>workers.</b> The simulation results indicate that income tax has a disincentive effect on both part-time and <b>full-time</b> <b>workers,</b> with part-time and <b>full-time</b> <b>workers</b> reducing their labor supply by 0. 87 and 0. 58 hours, respectively, if a 5 % tax is imposed. However, the percentage reduction in hours of work is very small, and a tax policy may have little effect on the labor supply of workers. The results seem to suggest that female and black part-time workers are more likely {{to drop out of the}} labor force at higher levels of income tax. It also tests the hypothesis that the labor supply behavior of parttime and <b>full-time</b> <b>workers</b> differs. The test results indicate that the determinants of the labor supply of part-time workers are different from those of <b>full-time</b> <b>workers.</b> It is noted that there is a significant difference between the labor supply of male part-time and female parttime workers, as well as between the black part-time and white part-time workers. In order to reduce voluntary unemployment in market activities among married females and blacks, the government can encourage part-time work by sponsoring legislation or instituting a scheme that will allow part-time workers to pay relatively less in payroll taxes. ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{businesses}} {{and the state}} of Virginia added a 29-hour-a-week cap for their part-time employees, to reflect the 30-hour-or-more definition for <b>full-time</b> <b>worker.</b> As of yet, however, only a small percent of companies have shifted their workforce towards more part-time hours (4% in a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis). [...] Trends in working hours and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time working hour patterns. The impact of this provision may have been offset by other factors, including that health insurance helps attract and retain employees, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism; and the lower training and administration costs of a smaller full-time workforce over a larger part-time work force. Relatively few firms employ over 50 employees and more than 90% of them offered insurance. Workers without employer insurance could purchase insurance on the exchanges.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable <b>full-time</b> <b>worker.</b> However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension pro rata was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E
