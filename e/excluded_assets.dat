40|$|A {{fundamental}} to the general policy in South African insolvency law is that the maximum quantity of assets must be recovered and included in the insolvent estate, {{to the advantage of}} the creditors. This means that all property that is owned by an insolvent at the date of sequestration, as well as all property which he acquires prior to his rehabilitation, forms part of the sequestrated estate. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule and an asset {{that is the subject of}} such an exception may not form part of the insolvent estate. The Insolvency Act, however, does not expressly distinguish between excluded and exempt assets, so various problem areas have consequently arisen in this regard. Uncertainty concerning such assets has existed in the past and given rise to litigation, and will probably continue to do so in the future. The fundamental difference between excluded and exempt assets is that <b>excluded</b> <b>assets,</b> in the author's opinion, should never form part of an insolvent estate. They should be beyond the reach of the creditors of the insolvent estate. Exempt assets, however, initially form part of the insolvent estate, but in certain circumstances those assets, or a portion thereof, may be exempted from the estate for the benefit of the insolvent debtor. Both <b>excluded</b> <b>assets</b> and exempt assets could also carry that status because they may belong to a third party. It is therefore possible for an insolvent to build up a (new) solvent personal estate with these excluded or exempt assets, which cannot be applied to for the payment of his debts in his insolvent estate.

40|$|The general {{policy in}} South African {{insolvency}} law is that assets must be recovered and {{included in the}} insolvent estate, and that this action must be {{to the advantage of}} the creditors of the insolvent estate. But there are several exceptions to this rule and an asset {{that is the subject of}} such an exception may be excluded from the insolvent estate. The Insolvency Act, however, does not expressly distinguish between excluded and exempt assets, thereby resulting in problem areas in the field of exemption law in insolvency in South Africa. It may be argued that the fundamental difference between excluded and exempt assets is that <b>excluded</b> <b>assets</b> should never form part of an insolvent estate and should be beyond the reach of the creditors of the insolvent estate, while exempt assets initially form part of the insolvent estate, but in certain circumstances may be exempted from the estate for the benefit of the insolvent debtor, thereby allowing the debtor to use such excluded or exempt assets to start afresh before or after rehabilitation. Modern society, sociopolitical developments and human rights requirements have necessitated a broadening of the classes of assets that should be excluded or exempted from insolvent estates. This article considers assets excluded from the insolvent estates of individual debtors by legislation other than the Insolvency Act. It must, however, be understood that these legislative provisions relate to insolvent estates and thus generally overlap in one way or another with some provisions of the Insolvency Act...|$|E

50|$|When using {{valuation}} multiples such as EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT, the numerator should {{correspond to}} the denominator. The EV should, therefore, {{correspond to the}} market value of the assets that were used to generate the profits in question, <b>excluding</b> <b>assets</b> acquired (and including assets disposed) during a different financial reporting period. This requires restating EV for any mergers and acquisitions (whether paid in cash or equity), significant capital investments or significant changes in working capital occurring after or during the reporting period being examined. Ideally, multiples should be calculated using {{the market value of}} the weighted average capital employed of the company during the comparable financial period.|$|R

Fund managers commonly exclude currency-hedged foreign equities and unhedged foreign bonds from portfolios. Meanvariance optimising allocations are used here {{to investigate this}} restriction. For robustness, ex post allocations are retested under Bayesian priors and with forecasts of long-run equity premiums under UIP.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{several new}} concepts for portfolio problems with independently distributed asset prices. A criterion is developed for including or <b>excluding</b> <b>assets</b> in an optimal portfolio for an investor maximizing the expected {{value of a}} von Neumann [...] Morgenstern utility function. The central concept of the generalized harmonic mean is introduced: it is shown to be the analogue of the riskless rate of return for problems without a riskless asset. A new ordering theorem is proven, showing that an optimal portfolio always consists of positive amounts of the assets with the largest mean values. Next, the concept of independence from irrelevant alternatives is introduced for portfolio problems; this is a property of utility functions and is proven to be true {{for most of the}} commonly used utility functions. Altogether, the results provide new insights and tools for portfolio problems with independent assets and extend earlier results by Samuelson, and Fishburn and Porter. portfolio theory, independently distributed assets, optimal portfolio, portfolio selection, expected utility maximization...|$|R
