25|$|Following France's {{loss in the}} French and Indian War, {{through the}} 1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British. Colonial {{settlement}} was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians, {{in order to try}} to end encroachment on Native American lands. The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog. With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the groups}} are finite. [...] The only {{infinite}} groups are either on the main diagonal or immediately above the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> (highlighted in yellow).|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} the groups below the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> in the table above are {{constant}} along the diagonals is explained by the suspension theorem of Hans Freudenthal, which [...] implies that the suspension homomorphism from [...] πn+k(S'n) to [...] πn+k+1(S'n+1) is an isomorphism for n > k + 1. [...] The groups πn+k(S'n) with n > k + 1 are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and are denoted πk'S: they are finite abelian groups for k ≠ 0, and have been computed in numerous cases, although the general pattern is still elusive[...] [...] For n ≤ k+1, the groups are called the unstable homotopy groups of spheres.|$|E

50|$|Adults are pale {{brown with}} {{a pattern of}} darker <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> across the wings. The wings are edged with gold fringes.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10 mm. Adults are brown with faint dark markings, including two vague <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> across the forewings. The hindwings are brown.|$|R
60|$|We kept on ascending, with {{occasional}} periods of quick descent, {{but in the}} main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious {{of the fact that}} the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> against the sky.|$|E
6000|$|... § 17. The way {{in which}} these curves are {{produced}} cannot, however, be guessed at until we examine the junction more closely. Ascending about five hundred feet above the cabin of the Montanvert, the opposite crest of the Bouchard, from a to c, Plate +33+, is seen more in front, expanded into the <b>jagged</b> <b>line,</b> a to c, Plate +34+, and the beds, with their fractures, are now seen clearly throughout the mass, namely: ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor, {{who said}} nothing, {{handed him the}} papers, and Brooke, who opened them vacantly, started a little {{when he saw the}} <b>jagged</b> <b>line,</b> which, in {{drawings}} of the kind, usually indicates a break, was now traced across the ore vein in the plan. There was also a scrap of paper, with his name scrawled across it, and he read, [...] "When you have got your dollars back four or five times over, sell out your stock." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 25 mm. Adults are off-white with dark brown markings, including several <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> across the forewings. The hindwings are pale yellow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} {{was granted}} on 14 May 1976. The arms show three, vertical, <b>jagged,</b> silver/white <b>lines</b> {{on a blue}} background. The <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> symbolically represent a river {{as a means for}} hydroelectricity. Historically, power was generated by watermills, providing a possibility for the development of an industry in the village. Presently, the power is used for melting metal ore in smelters in the municipality.|$|R
5000|$|Atypical {{migraine}} if visual symptoms occur such as {{the perception}} of wavy or <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> or tiny specks of light and if a headache occurs. Typically a history of prior migraines is present.|$|R
6000|$|The whole vast {{plain of}} Gascony and of Languedoc is an arid and profitless expanse in winter save where the swift-flowing Adour and her snow-fed tributaries, the Louts, the Oloron and the Pau, run {{down to the}} sea of Biscay. South of the Adour the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of {{mountains}} which fringe the sky-line send out long granite claws, running down into the lowlands and dividing them into [...] "gaves" [...] or stretches of valley. Hillocks grow into hills, and hills into mountains, each range overlying its neighbor, until they soar up in the giant chain which raises its spotless and untrodden peaks, white and dazzling, against the pale blue wintry sky.|$|E
6000|$|They did see. They {{were barely}} half-way to the yacht, when there came {{the sound of}} a low {{rumbling}} from the castle. Suddenly it broke into a roar. Belching sheets of flame burst out on every side. Huge cracks in that brilliant light were suddenly visible in the walls, creeping in a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> from the foundation to the turret. Fragments of the stone work flew outwards and upwards. It seemed as though some mighty internal force were splitting the place up. The men in the boat sat breathless and transfixed. Only Guiseppe whispered: [...] "It is the old Count! He is the devil! He has blown the place up!" ...|$|E
60|$|Out of {{the mist}} the tear-stained face of Polly Ann bent over me. I put up my hand, and dropped it again with a cry. Then, my senses coming with a rush, the {{familiar}} objects of the cabin outlined themselves: Tom's winter hunting shirt, Polly Ann's woollen shift and sunbonnet on their pegs; the big stone chimney, the ladder to the loft, the closed door, with a long, <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> across it where the wood was splintered; and, dearest of all, the chubby forms of Peggy and little Tom playing on the trundle-bed. Then my glance wandered to the floor, and on the puncheons were three stains. I closed my eyes.|$|E
50|$|Resolution, 600 or 1200 dpi (dots per inch) {{is common}} in most modern page printers, often with {{resolution}} enhancement or anti-aliasing to smooth uneven lines. Higher resolutions are common. Before about 1992, the year Hewlett-Packard made the LaserJet 4, built around a Canon engine, most page printers had only 300 dpi, which made visible <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> and relatively poor image quality.|$|R
50|$|In broadcasting, a {{corrupted}} signal may glitch in {{the form}} of <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> on the screen, misplaced squares, static looking effects, freezing problems, or inverted colors. The glitches may affect the video and/or audio (usually audio dropout) or the transmission. These glitches may be caused by a variety of issues, interference from portable electronics or microwaves, damaged cables at the broadcasting center, or weather.|$|R
5000|$|Pepper's {{most famous}} {{composition}} is probably [...] "Straight Life". Composed {{long before the}} autobiography of the same title was published, it features the <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> he typically played and was typically played at a breakneck tempo. It was recorded numerous times by Pepper, both in his [...] "early" [...] period and his [...] "later" [...] years. Perhaps the most famous version was included on the 1957 Art Pepper Meets The Rhythm Section.|$|R
60|$|In the British Museum is a vase, No. 1257, {{engraved}} (Lenormant et De Witte, Mon. Céram., i. pl. 27), {{of which}} the subject is, Europa crossing the sea {{on the back of}} the bull. In this design the sea is represented by a variety of expedients. First, the swimming action of the bull suggests the idea of the liquid medium through which he moves. Behind him stands Nereus, his staff held perpendicularly in his hand; the top of his staff comes nearly to the level of the bull's back, and is probably meant as the measure of the whole depth of the sea. Towards the surface line thus indicated a dolphin is rising; in the middle depth is another dolphin; below a shrimp and a cuttle-fish, and the bottom is indicated by a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of rocks, on which are two echini.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, almost inch by inch, {{and with}} a {{suspense}} that was agonizing, we crossed some twenty or thirty feet above {{the top of the}} wall. I could see as we came near the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of white patches where the heads of the massacred Turks placed there on spikes in old days seemed to give still their grim warning. Seeing that they made in themselves a difficulty of landing on the wall, I deflected the plane so that, as we crept over the wall, we might, if they became displaced, brush them to the outside of the wall. A few seconds more, and I was able to bring the machine to rest with the front of the platform jutting out beyond the Tower wall. Here I anchored her fore and aft with clamps which had been already prepared.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} speak, {{but she could}} not. The hideous imperturbability of the man's hatred sickened her. And her husband! The chips fell in silence until a noise on the road caused them to look up. Chiltern was coming back. She glanced again at the farmer, but his face was equally incapable, or equally unwilling, to express regret. Chiltern rode into the dooryard. The blood from the scratch on his {{forehead}} had crossed his temple and run in a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> down his cheek, his very hair (as she had sometimes seen it) was damp with perspiration, blacker, kinkier; his eyes hard, reckless, bloodshot. So, in the past, must he have emerged from dozens of such wilful, brutal contests with man and beast. He had beaten the sweat-stained horse (temporarily--such was the impression Honora received), {{but she knew that}} he would like to have killed it for its opposition.|$|E
5|$|The groups {{below the}} <b>jagged</b> black <b>line</b> are {{constant}} along the diagonals (as {{indicated by the}} red, green and blue coloring).|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. Adults are grey with two <b>jagged</b> black <b>lines</b> across each forewing, and one across each hindwing.|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristic}} contours {{in computer}} graphics, the <b>jagged</b> <b>lines,</b> {{are reminiscent of}} Maya and Aztec cultural shapes. Wandrey's masks fit into this context, starting with the poster design for LiLaLe, the artists’ festival held by Hamburg’s University of Fine Arts (Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg) in 1967. The design featured the photograph of a woman’s face which was so intensely simplified and erotically manipulated that it acquired an enigmatic, mask-like anonymity creating an almost aphrodisiac effect.|$|R
6000|$|What {{appeared}} to be a green mountainside sloped endlessly down to a plain, and that rolled and billowed away to a boundless region of strangely carved rock. The greatness of the scene could not be grasped in a glance. The slope was long; the plain not as level as it seemed to be on first sight; here and there round, red rocks, isolated and strange, like lonely castles, rose out of the green. Beyond the green all the earth seemed naked, showing smooth, glistening bones. It was a formidable wall of rock that flung itself up in the distance, carved into a thousand cañon and walls and domes and peaks, and there was not a straight nor a broken nor a <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> in all that wildness. The color low down was red, dark blue, and purple in the clefts, yellow upon the heights, and in the distance rainbow-hued. A land of curves and color! ...|$|E
60|$|Before {{going down}} to his boat Babalatchi stopped {{for a while in}} the big open space where the thick-leaved trees put black patches of shadow which seemed to float on a flood of smooth, intense light that rolled up to the houses and down to the stockade and over the river, where it broke and sparkled in {{thousands}} of glittering wavelets, like a band woven of azure and gold edged with the brilliant green of the forests guarding both banks of the Pantai. In the perfect calm before the coming of the afternoon breeze the irregularly <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of tree-tops stood unchanging, as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of the hot sky. In the space sheltered by the high palisades there lingered the smell of decaying blossoms from the surrounding forest, a taint of drying fish; with now and then a whiff of acrid smoke from the cooking fires when it eddied down from under the leafy boughs and clung lazily about the burnt-up grass.|$|E
6000|$|It was Libby at the helm, as {{she could}} dimly see, but {{what it was in}} his {{management}} that moved Barlow's praise she could not divine. The boat seemed to be aimed for the shore, and to be rushing, head on, upon the beach; her broad sail was blown straight out over her bow, and flapped there like a banner, while the heavy boom hammered the water as she rose and fell. A <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of red seamed the breast of the dark wall behind; a rending crash came, and as if fired upon, the boat flung up her sail, as a wild fowl flings up its wing when shot, and lay tossing keel up, {{on the top of the}} waves. It all looked scarcely a stone's cast away, though it was vastly farther. A figure was seen to drag itself up out of the sea, and fall over into the boat, hovering and pitching in the surrounding welter, and struggling to get at two other figures clinging to the wreck. Suddenly the men in the boat pulled away, and Grace uttered a cry of despair and reproach: [...] "Why, they're leaving it, they're leaving it!" ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} showing {{the operation of the}} radula in mollusks. The upper portion is mostly a one-pen-width filled outline diagram, but it has a mesh gradient fill along the bottom of the shell and along the bottom of food. It also has some artistic brushes on the upper left of the shell. The bottom portion of the illustration has four line weights and some small characters; the color fill is simple except for a gradient at the <b>jagged</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some older {{versions}} of dvips with embedded bitmapped fonts, which represented letters and symbols as pictures {{at a fixed}} resolution (for instance, at 300 dpi). When such files are printed on newer devices (some with resolution of 1200 dpi), {{the letters of the}} files that have bitmapped fonts display a remarkably low quality, with <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> on curves and diagonals. One solution to this problem is to substitute the bitmapped fonts with scalable fonts (known among PostScript users as Type 1 fonts).|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{answered}} the other. [...] "I think it's because the place itself, so to speak, seems {{to happen and}} not merely to exist. Perhaps that's what old Picasso {{and some of the}} Cubists are trying to express by angles and <b>jagged</b> <b>lines.</b> Look at that wall like low cliffs that juts forward just at right angles to the slope of turf sweeping up to it. That's like a silent collision. It's like a breaker and the back-wash of a wave." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{each side}} of us, precipice over precipice, cavern within cavern, rose the great cliffs {{protecting}} the land against the raging sea. Three hundred feet beneath, the foam was boiling far out over a reef of black rocks. Above and around, flocks of sea-birds flew in ever lengthening circles, or perched flapping their wings and sunning their plumage, on ledges of riven stone below us. Every object forming the wide sweep of the view was on the vastest and most majestic scale. The wild varieties of form in the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of rocks stretched away eastward and westward, {{as far as the}} eye could reach; black shapeless masses of mist scowled over the whole landward horizon; the bright blue sky at the opposite point was covered with towering white clouds which moved and changed magnificently; the tossing and raging of the great bright sea was sublimely contrasted by the solitude and tranquillity of the desert, overshadowed land--while ever and ever, sounding as they first sounded when the morning stars sang together, the rolling waves and the rushing wind pealed out their primeval music over the whole scene! ...|$|E
6000|$|I hid {{my face in}} my hands. The twitter of {{the young}} birds going to rest, and their {{rustling}} among the trees, disturbed the still evening-air--the crickets chirped--the aziolo cooed at intervals. My thoughts had been of death--these sounds spoke to me of life. I lifted up my eyes--a bat wheeled round--the sun had sunk behind the <b>jagged</b> <b>line</b> of mountains, and the paly, crescent moon was visible, silver white, amidst the orange sunset, and accompanied by one bright star, prolonged thus the twilight. A herd of cattle passed along in the dell below, untended, towards their watering place--the grass was rustled by a gentle breeze, and the olive-woods, mellowed into soft masses by the moonlight, contrasted their sea-green with the dark chestnut foliage. Yes, this is the earth; there is no change--no ruin--no rent made in her verdurous expanse; she continues to wheel round and round, with alternate night and day, through the sky, though man is not her adorner or inhabitant. Why could I not forget myself {{like one of those}} animals, and no longer suffer the wild tumult of misery that I endure? Yet, ah! what a deadly breach yawns between their state and mine! Have not they companions? Have not they each their mate--their cherished young, their home, which, though unexpressed to us, is, I doubt not, endeared and enriched, even in their eyes, by the society which kind nature has created for them? It is I only that am alone--I, on this little hill top, gazing on plain and mountain recess--on sky, and its starry population, listening to every sound of earth, and air, and murmuring wave,--I only cannot express to any companion my many thoughts, nor lay my throbbing head on any loved bosom, nor drink from meeting eyes an intoxicating dew, that transcends the fabulous nectar of the gods. Shall I not then complain? Shall I not curse the murderous engine which has mowed down the children of men, my brethren? Shall I not bestow a malediction on every other of nature's offspring, which dares live and enjoy, while I live and suffer? ...|$|E

The woman stands at center in a spotted dress and floral shawl with her head tilted down towards the right. A large jug hangs against her back from the strap which rests over the lightly-colored sash that covers her dark hair.

50|$|The {{effect of}} jaggies {{can be reduced}} {{somewhat}} by a graphics technique known as spatial anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing smooths out <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> by surrounding the jaggies with transparent pixels to simulate the appearance of fractionally-filled pixels. The downside of anti-aliasing is that it reduces contrast - rather than sharp black/white transitions, there are shades of gray - and the resulting image is fuzzy. This is an inescapable trade-off: if the resolution is insufficient to display the desired detail, the output will either be jagged or fuzzy, or some combination thereof.|$|R
5000|$|... ln the {{personal}} exhibition {{presented at the}} Église Courmelois at Val-De-Vesle in 1991, Penone displayed the large sculpture titled Suture ("Sutures"), which he worked on between 1987 and 1991. ln it the enlarged negative {{of the image of}} a human brain is rendered by four <b>jagged</b> <b>lines</b> of steel that reproduce the points of contact between the four lobes, marking their boundaries and lines of contact with each other. A Y-shaped transparent glass tube containing soil constitutes the central element of the sculpture and raises the subject of the relationship between man and nature.|$|R
