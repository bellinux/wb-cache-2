5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of Rio <b>Grande</b> do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio <b>Grande</b> do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio <b>Grande</b> do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Marques de Sousa {{was born}} on 13 June 1804 (sometimes erroneously given as 1805) in Rio <b>Grande.</b> The town was located in Rio <b>Grande</b> do Sul, a {{southern}} captaincy (later province) of Brazil, then part of the Portuguese Colonial Empire. His parents were Manuel Marques de Sousa and Senhorinha Inácia da Silveira. He had four younger siblings: two sisters and two brothers. An archetypal leading family of Rio <b>Grande</b> do Sul, Marques de Sousa's Portuguese-descended family was wealthy and influential, owning ranches and huge cattle herds. His father and his paternal grandfather, both also named Manuel Marques de Sousa, were seasoned soldiers {{who took part in}} the colonial wars.

50|$|Pastos <b>Grandes</b> was {{volcanic}}ally {{active for}} a long time, more than many other Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex centres. Later more recent volcanic centres formed within the caldera, the youngest of these centres are relatively recent Such recent centres close to Pastos <b>Grandes</b> are Cerro Chao and Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita complex. The former of which lies on a lineament that appears {{to coincide with the}} caldera rim of Pastos <b>Grandes,</b> and the latter seems to rise from the ring fault of Pastos <b>Grandes.</b> but is apparently unrelated to the caldera. Cerro Chascon-Runtu Jarita is less than 100,000 years old according to argon-argon dating. This and ongoing geothermal manifestations suggest that volcanic activity may still occur at Pastos <b>Grandes.</b> Finally, Pastos <b>Grandes</b> and Cerro Guacha may be the heat source for the El Tatio geothermal field west of Pastos <b>Grandes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The largest {{identified}} {{settlement in}} Northern Chihuahua is {{known today as}} Paquimé or Casas <b>Grandes.</b> Casas <b>Grandes</b> was probably a backwater until about 1200 CE when pochteca (traders) from the Aztec empire or other Mesoamerican states to the south {{turned it into a}} major trading center. A diametrically opposed theory is that Casas <b>Grandes</b> was established by the elites of the Anasazi from the north who were fleeing their homeland during its decline. A third theory speculates that Casas <b>Grandes</b> is a community that grew over time to dominate its region and adopted some religious and social customs from the civilizations of Mesoamerica. The language the inhabitants of Casas <b>Grandes</b> spoke is unknown. Given the Mesoamerican influence on Casas <b>Grandes</b> Nahuatl was probably widely spoken but it was not the primary language of the people.|$|R

In all, the nine hydroelectric dams there produce over 16,500MW of electric power, with the Robert-Bourassa or La Grande-2 station generating over 5,600MW alone.

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio <b>Grande</b> Western, hoped to be the first.
