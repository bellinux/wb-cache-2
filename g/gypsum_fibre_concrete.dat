40|$|D. Ing. (Civil Engineering) Polypropylene (PP) fibre {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used <b>fibres</b> for {{reinforcing}} <b>concrete.</b> Due to its unique material properties such as economic production cost, relatively high melting point and alkaline resistance, PP <b>fibres</b> in <b>concrete</b> are found to increase the toughness, provide restrained plastic and drying shrinkage cracking resistance, increase impact resistance and flexural loading capacity (especially during the post-crack stage) of concrete structures and components. The wettability of PP fibre surfaces is poor due to the hydrophobic surface nature of polypropylene. The bonding between the PP <b>fibre</b> and the <b>concrete</b> matrix is recognized as poor and currently the PP <b>fibre</b> / <b>concrete</b> interfacial bonding depends upon interlocking and keying (mechanical bonding). As the interfacial bond strength between the PP <b>fibre</b> and the <b>concrete</b> is much smaller than the tensile strength of PP <b>fibre</b> and <b>concrete,</b> in order to fully explore the reinforcing effect of PP <b>fibres</b> in <b>concrete,</b> further improvement of interfacial bonding is necessary. In this investigation, the research work was conducted on the surface oxyfluorinated PP fibre newly developed by the Atomic Energy Corporation of South Africa Limited. Examining the feasibility of using this <b>fibre</b> in <b>concrete,</b> as well as evaluating its superiority over unmodified PP fibres, is the key task of this investigation. This new type of oxyfluorinated PP fibre shows a large increase in interfacial bond strength compared to the unmodified PP fibres. The surface free energy concept and Lewis acid-base interfacial interaction theory were innovatively used to examine the interfacial bonding between the PP <b>fibre</b> and the <b>concrete</b> matrix. The purpose of this study was to develop the background of such oxyfluorinated PP fibres, to establish the mechanism of the increase in interfacial bonding and to investigate the basic properties of the concrete incorporating oxyfluorinated PP fibres. The experimental results on the properties of oxyfluorinated PP <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> compared with those of unmodified PP <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> and plain concrete are presented, with some field test results focused on the improvement in shrinkage cracking control capacity.

As {{there is a lack}} of understanding of structural behaviour of FRC,this paper reports a study on the influence of fibres on the behaviour of flexural members, and it focuses on a partial-interaction structural mechanics model for the deflection calculation of concrete beams reinforced with steel or FRP bars and fibres. For this, a model is developed to incorporate fibres into both tension and compression regions in generating moment-rotation response and also on crack formation and the tension-stiffening mehanism. For calibrating these models an experimental study on the bond-slip relationship between FRP bars and <b>fibre</b> <b>concrete</b> was required for the tension stiffening analysis; and an experimental study on the slip-crack width relationship between <b>fibres</b> and <b>concrete</b> required for the moment-rotation model. The moment-rotation and tension stiffening models were then used to obtain the load deflection (P-Δ) response through integration of discrete rotations at the determined crack locations throughout the member. The theoretical load-deflection responses are compared to the experimental results, showing very good correlation for the ultimate flexural capacity and the ductility of PVA <b>fibre</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> members.

40|$|Deterioration of {{concrete}} structures {{due to the}} corrosion of embedded steel is a well-known universal problem. Norway with its numerous bridges, ports, offshore and floating structures along its coastline, is also encountered with corrosion degradation. The harsh environment of the Norwegian Sea regarding its low temperature, wind, and waves, makes the design and construction of marine structures more demanding. In recent years, usage of sustainable composite materials {{in the field of}} structural engineering has been rising. The usage of natural fibre reinforced polymer materials in the form of reinforcement bars or macro fibres with a low density, high strength, and excellent corrosion resistance, gives us better choices for the design and construction of marine structures. Our knowledge about the <b>fibre</b> reinforced self-compacting <b>concrete</b> has increased as a result of introducing it as a building material some decades ago. However, more research is still needed {{when it comes to the}} application of new types of fibres. This thesis is a result of this need, whereby the author has done two series of experimental programmes regarding the subject. In the first series, the flow characteristics of fresh state, conventional and self-compacting macro basalt <b>fibre</b> <b>concrete</b> were studied. In the second series, mechanical properties of high performance and medium strength macro basalt <b>fibre</b> <b>concrete</b> including the post-cracking behaviour, compressive strength and electrical resistivity were in focus. The findings were presented in three appended papers and the extended summary composing this thesis. Additionally, the thesis presents an overview of the design procedure of floating concrete structures and the possibility of using macro basalt <b>fibre</b> <b>concrete</b> via a case study. The author’s literature review shows that basalt fibres have an adequate resistance against alkali environment of the concrete matrix and corrosive environment of seawater. QC 20160607 </p...|$|R
