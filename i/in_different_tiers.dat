Many Pashto last names come from the name of the tribe or the subdivisions of a specific tribe: in this case their name would end in -zai (son) or khel (group), (e.g. a Ghilzai Pashtun would likely have Ghilzai as their last name and a Pashtun from specifically the Adamkhel subtribe may use Adamkhel as their last name). Some tribal names have no suffix (e.g. Afridi, Sarbanri, Abdali). One must understand that many Pashtun tribes are composed of super tribes and subtribes, in other words, there are several tribes within tribes branching off and ranked <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>tiers.</b> For example, an Omarkhel Yusufzai Pashtun would have the option to use the name of their super tribe name [...] "Sarbanri", their tribe Yusufzai, or Omarkhel, a subdivision of Yusufzai.

40|$|Based on {{consultation}} with Member States, EFSA asked the Panel {{to prepare a}} revision of the Guidance Document on the persistence of plant protection products in soil (SANCO/ 9188 VI/ 1997 of 12 July 2000) as scientific knowledge in this field has evolved in recent years. Therefore the Panel developed a revised methodology {{for the assessment of}} exposure of soil organisms to such products. Based on a previous Opinion of the Panel, this methodology has been developed both for the concentration in total soil and the concentration in the soil pore water. The goal of the exposure assessment has been chosen to be the 90 th percentile of the exposure concentration in the intended area of use {{in each of the three}} regulatory geographical zones (North, Centre, South). The exposure-assessment methodology is restricted to spray applications to annual crops under conventional or reduced tillage (excluding tillage systems with ridges and furrows). The Panel proposes a tiered approach. Tier 1 is based on a simple analytical model. Tier 2 A is based on simulations with numerical models. To keep the approach as simple as possible, the Panel based Tiers 1 and 2 A for each regulatory zone on only one scenario each for the concentration in total soil and for that in pore water. These scenarios are to be used for all these annual crops and for all plant protection products in each regulatory zone. Tiers 2 B and 2 C are also based on the simple analytical model but in these tiers a specific crop or crop group and an individual plant protection product are considered. Tier 3 is based on simulations with numerical models but, as in Tiers 2 B and 2 C, a specific crop or crop group and a specific plant protection product are considered. All tiers aim to assess the same exposure assessment goal. Given the complexity of the calculations <b>in</b> the <b>different</b> <b>tiers,</b> efficient use of this tiered approach in the regulatory process is impossible without software tools. Therefore the Panel recommends developing user-friendly software tools for the calculation of the exposure concentrations <b>in</b> the <b>different</b> <b>tier...</b>|$|R

The paper defines scenarios that capture key elements of the modalities negotiations and undertakes simulations using a global dynamic general equilibrium model to {{examine the impact of}} multilateral agricultural trade reforms on African economies. The scenarios vary in their level of ambition in the market access pillar through both the level of tariff cuts <b>in</b> the <b>different</b> <b>tiers</b> and the level of sensitive sectors defined both for developed and developing economies. Results show that ambitious coefficients in the market access pillar remain the best outcome for Africa. Even what might seem to be an insignificant definition of sensitive products for developed countries erodes potential benefits from deep tariff cuts for African countries. This suggests that utilizing sensitive products tariff lines by developed countries not only dampens the expected positive outcomes for agriculture negotiations in favour of Africa but could also actually wipe out such gains. The results further confirm findings of other studies showing that tariff cuts for agricultural goods yield higher gains than elimination of subsidies, and this applies mainly to net food importing developing countries. Thus, reduction of subsidies should go hand-in-hand with agricultural tariff reductions in order to ensure win-win outcomes. ...|$|R
