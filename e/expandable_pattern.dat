(<b>Expandable</b> <b>pattern)</b> A pattern P is expandable, if it {{does not}} have a {{redundant}} node X such that: (1) X is not on the rightmost path of P, or (2) X is on the rightmost path of P and L_X is equal to L_X_ 1 ∪...∪ L_X_k, where X_ 1, [...]..., X_k are the images of node X under a homomorphism from P to itself.|$|E
30|$|During the {{candidate}} generation, we cannot, however, simply discard candidates that are redundant, since {{they may be}} needed for generating non-redundant patterns. For instance, the pattern P_ 5 shown in Fig. 3 b is redundant, but it is needed (as the left operand in a join operation with P_ 7) to generate the non-redundant pattern P_ 6 shown in the same figure. Clearly, we want to avoid {{as much as possible}} generating patterns that are redundant. In order to do so, we introduce the notion of <b>expandable</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{process that}} {{combines}} a vacuum <b>expandable</b> <b>pattern</b> casting V-EPC with self-propagation high-temperature synthesis SHS of TiB 2 /TiC particles for the fabrication of the TiB 2 +TiC duplex particulates reinforced carbon steel matrix surface composite are introduced in this paper. The effect of ferrotitanium addition in the SHS reactants on the macro and micro structures {{as well as}} hardness is investigated. It {{has been found that}} with the increase of ferrotitanium addition, the concentration of synthesized particles in the layer gradually increases to maximum, then decreases. The hardness gradually decreases from the surface compound layer to core and the maximum hardness of 1682 HV is obtained on the composite surface...|$|E
3000|$|Let P_ 1, P_ 2, [...]..., P_n {{stand for}} a {{sequence}} of n <b>expandable</b> <b>patterns</b> satisfying the above linear order. Each pattern in the sequence has a rightmost leaf node x. For a pattern P_k, if the occurrence set of P_k(x) {{is the same as}} the union of the occurrence sets of P_i(x), i= 1,...,k- 1, then the set of occurrences of P_k {{is the same as the}} union of occurrence sets of P_i’s. In this case, it is not useful to further expand P_k, since it is refined by a set of more specific patterns. We call P_k a refinable pattern. In Fig. 7, pattern Q_ 2 is refined by Q_ 1.|$|R
40|$|CASTING PROCESS In this work, a {{possibility}} {{to develop a}} new zircon-based refractory coating for casting applications was investigated. Optimization of the coating composition with controlled rheological properties was attained by application of different coating components, particularly by application of a new suspension agent and by alteration of coating production procedure. Zircon powder with particle size of 25 × 10 - 6 m was used as filler. The zircon sample was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction analysis, diffraction thermal analysis and polarized micros-copy. The shape and grain size were analyzed using OZARIA 2. 5 software. It was shown that application of this type of water-alcohol-based coating had a positive influence on surface quality, structural and mechanical properties of the castings of cast iron obtained by pouring into sand molds by means of the <b>expandable</b> <b>patterns</b> method (Lost Foam casting process) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{different}} tungsten-bearing materials addition in a surface preform, such as Ni-base WC particles, ferrotungsten powders and casting WC particles, {{on the reinforcement}} phases at the surface compound layer with a carbon steel substrate is investigated under the condition of vacuum <b>expandable</b> <b>pattern</b> casting V-EPC. The microstructures and reinforcement phases are characterized by optical microscopy, SEM and EDS. Experimental results show {{that it is impossible}} to synthesize the independent WC particles in each condition. The tungsten-containing materials are all inclined to decompose during steel infiltration and the released tungsten elements tend to combine with carbon to form fish born-like or strip-like WC or W 2 C carbides and dissolve in other type of carbides and matrix...|$|E
5000|$|One way {{to create}} {{quasi-periodic}} patterns {{is to create a}} Penrose tiling. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called [...] "dart" [...] and [...] "kite", but {{there is no evidence that}} this approach was used by medieval artisans. Another {{way to create}} quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller girih tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would have been evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, all known girih patterns made with girih tiles show no more than a two-level design. In fact, there would have been no practical need to have a girih pattern that had more than two levels of design, because a third level would have a scale either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues, The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely <b>expandable</b> quasiperiodic <b>patterns.</b> However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} second {{preimage}} attack on all n-bit iterated hash functions with Damgård-Merkle strengthening and n-bit intermediate states, allowing a second preimage {{to be found}} for a 2 k-message-block message with about k × 2 n/ 2 + 1 + 2 n−k+ 1 work. Using SHA 1 as an example, our attack can find a second preimage for a 2 ^ 60 byte message in 2 ^ 106 work, rather than the previously expected 2 ^ 160 work. We also provide slightly cheaper ways to find multicollisions than the method of Joux[J 04]. Both of these results are based on <b>expandable</b> messages – <b>patterns</b> for producing messages of varying length, which all collide on the intermediate hash result immediately after processing the message. We also provide algorithms for finding expandable messages for a hash function, using only a small multiple of the work done to find a single collision in the hash function...|$|R
40|$|Stellar Imager (SI) is a {{potential}} NASA space-based UV imaging interferometer to resolve the stellar disks of nearby stars. SI would consist of 20 - 30 separate spacecraft flying in formation at the Earth-Sun L 2 libration point. Onboard wavefront control {{would be required to}} initially align the formation and maintain alignment during science observations and after array reconfiguration. The Fizeau Interferometry Testbed (FIT) is a testbed currently under development at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center to develop and study the wavefront control methodologies for Stellar Imager and other large, sparse aperture telescope systems. FIT consists of 7 articulated spherical mirrors in a Golay <b>pattern,</b> <b>expandable</b> upto 30 elements, and reconfigurable into multiple array patterns. FIT’s purpose is to demonstrate image quality versus array configuration and to develop and advance the wavefront control for SI. FIT uses extended scene wavelength, focus and field diversity to estimate the wavefront across the set of apertures. The recovered wavefront is decomposed into the eigenmodes of the control matrix and actuators are moved to minimize the wavefront piston, tip and tilt. Each mirror’s actuators are 3 degrees of freedom, however, they do not move each of the mirrors about a point on each mirrors surface, thus the mapping from wavefront piston, tip/tilt to mirror piston, tip/tilt is not diagonal. We initially estimate this mapping but update it as part o...|$|R
