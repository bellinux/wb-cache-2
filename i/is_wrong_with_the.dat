5|$|In {{the year}} 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have {{appeared}} about 400 years early. They {{were born and}} bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places. When the characters {{come to realize that}} something <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> universe, the heroes must solve the mystery behind their own existence, while dealing with intrigue at the courts of Elizabeth and James.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> argument, not just the conclusions. Through history, several solutions have been proposed, among the earliest recorded being those of Aristotle and Archimedes.|$|E

Tommy Barban, another guest, comes loyally to the defense of the Divers. The action involves various other friends, including the Norths, where a frequent occurrence is the drunken behavior of Abe North. The story becomes complicated when Jules Peterson, a black man, is murdered and ends up in Rosemary's bed, in a situation which could destroy Rosemary's career. Dick moves the blood-soaked body to cover up any implied relationship between Rosemary and Peterson.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them." ...|$|E
500|$|Guy Rickards, concurring that The Wood Nymph [...] "never quite escapes a {{dependence}} on the verses", has echoed Tawaststjerna in wondering {{what might have been}} had Sibelius returned in his maturity to The Wood Nymph, as with [...] Finnish composer Kalevi Aho's response has been similar, calling the ballade [...] "an interesting work" [...] in need of [...] "more polishing". Finnish conductor Osmo Vänskä, however, has championed the ballad. [...] "It's a tremendous piece," [...] Vänskä has said in interview. [...] "He [...] never managed to revise it, but nothing <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> music. Sibelius never forbade performance of The Wood Nymph." [...] Stylistically, scholars have detected in The Wood Nymph the influence of Richard Wagner. Murtomäki, for example, discerns the [...] "erotic harmonic vocabulary" [...] of Tristan und Isolde in the third section and the [...] "motive of the forbidden question" [...] from Lohengrin in the funereal march from the finale. In light of Sibelius's [...] "Nietzschean response" [...] to Wagner's operas (initially enamored, Sibelius by July 1894 had repudiated Wagner's ideas as [...] "calculated" [...] and [...] "manufactured"), such observations are of particular interest in that they illustrate the extent to which Sibelius, at the time of The Wood Nymph, had not yet succeeded in breaking with the German master.|$|E

500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E

[...] Ryan Brockington of New York Post {{compared}} the show to Samantha Who?. The Daily News David Hinckley opined that the show is [...] "a waste of Cox's comic talents". In The Irish Times Kate Holmquist writes that [...] "Cox is both a symbol and a red light warning for everything that <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hollywood portrayal of middle-aged women, who are rarely wise or strong or naturally aged" [...] and states that she is [...] "the female version of the pervert in a dirty raincoat".|$|E

It played a huge role in the last elections." [...] On the same day, Lim Kit Siang raised the issue of Raja Petra's sedition charges in Parliament, arguing that Najib had personally intervened to ensure the Attorney-General would charge Raja Petra with sedition, and calling it an abuse of power.|$|E

[...] The Star also quoted employment lawyer Howard Levitt stating that [...] "harassment has not been fully addressed at the CBC" [...] in his estimation. Levitt called the Rubin report a [...] "whitewash" [...] and reiterated his suggestion that a federal commission should conduct a more detailed enquiry into workplace issues at the public broadcaster.|$|E
2500|$|Computer {{programmer}} Thomas Anderson lives {{a double}} life under the hacker alias [...] "Neo". He believes something <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase [...] "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo at his office and attempt to get a plea bargain out of Neo in exchange for helping them capture Morpheus, whom they call a terrorist. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill, which {{will allow him to}} learn the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill, which will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, Neo's reality disintegrates and he awakens, naked and weak, in a liquid-filled pod, one of countless people connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{ramifications of}} the scandal came in summer 2009, when {{leadership}} of Cotidianul newspaper {{was taken over by}} Cornel Nistorescu, whose change in editorial line prompted a wave of resignations among the newspaper panelists, who identified the new policies as an unmitigated anti-Băsescu bias, and complained that Nistorescu was imposing censorship on independent contributors. In subsequent statements, Nistorescu alleged that his adversaries represented a pro-Băsescu [...] "pack" [...] led by Tismăneanu himself. Journalist Mădălina Șchiopu reacted against this perspective and other accusations aimed by Nistorescu toward his former colleagues, arguing that they amounted to [...] "a story with little green men and flying saucers" [...] which served to cover the [...] "fundamental incompatibility between [...] decisions and the notion of decency." [...] She viewed [...] "the idea that the source for all that <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Romanian press can be found somewhere in Tismăneanu's entourage" [...] as equivalent to declaring that Tismăneanu [...] "turns into a vârcolac under the fool moon and eats the newly born". In one of his other editorials, the new Cotidianul editor revisited Tismăneanu's past, quoting statements from the 1980s which, he wrote, made Tismăneanu [...] "a devoted communist activist" [...] incompatible with his later appointments: [...] "The chairman of the Presidential Commission could do anything, except condemning that which he has supported." [...] The events also prompted an article by Tismăneanu's friend, novelist Mircea Cărtărescu. It sarcastically included Nistorescu, alongside Vadim Tudor, Roșca-Stănescu, Voiculescu, Geoană and businessman Dinu Patriciu, all of them adverse to Băsescu, among the [...] "champions of democracy", noting that himself, Tismăneanu and other public figures who did not abandon Băsescu's cause [...] "despite his human flaws", were being negatively portrayed as [...] "ass-kissers" [...] and [...] "blind people".|$|E
