25|$|Moreover {{at a spot}} in the Park {{where there}} is a charming wood he has another Palace built of cane, of which I must <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> description. It is gilt all over, and most elaborately {{finished}} inside. It is stayed on gilt and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave. The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them. These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length. They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from lifting it. In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken to pieces and removed whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced against mishaps from the wind by more than 200 cords of silk.|$|E

The bottom line is we're just trying to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense {{of what it was like}} to hang out around this person. That's really it.

500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan.

If {{you say that you}} are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry."

500|$|Matheson's script freely devised an {{elaborate}} narrative that barely resembled Poe, {{with only the}} finale having any similarity {{at all to the}} original short story on which the film was based. [...] Corman noted, [...] "The method we adopted on The Pit and the Pendulum was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third act to the motion picture... because a two-page short story is not about to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> ninety-minute motion picture. [...] We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Cavallari told Access Hollywood {{that the}} cast {{followed}} a [...] "schedule" [...] of events to be filmed {{on a given}} day, adding, [...] "We only filmed The Hills three days a week, and we did three different scenes each day and {{a change of clothes}} to film a specific scene [...] They were pushing it as far as they could go without an actual script... They <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> schedule like, 'You have lunch with Heidi [...] at 3 to talk about the party coming up' or whatever the situation may be". She had earlier commented that she felt viewers [...] "need to understand it's all entertainment" [...] and she [...] "would never put [...] close friends or a real relationship on a show".|$|E

[...] The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, [...] "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. [...] She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the daily luncheons, members of the Round Table worked and associated with each other almost constantly. The group was devoted to games, including cribbage and poker. The group had its own poker club, the Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club, which met at the hotel on Saturday nights. Regulars at the game included Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross and Woollcott, with non-Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope, silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner, baking heir Raoul Fleischmann, actor Harpo Marx, and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in. The group also played charades (which they called simply [...] "The Game") and the [...] "I can <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sentence" [...] game, which spawned Dorothy Parker's memorable sentence using the word horticulture: [...] "You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think." ...|$|E
500|$|Mills' {{management}} style {{was influenced by}} a number of managers he played under, including John Barnwell, Brian Clough, Alan Hinton, Howard Kendall, Brian Little, David Pleat, Russell Slade and Neil Warnock. He learned simplicity from Clough, saying: [...] "He never did complicate anything. Football is a simple game and Cloughie was no coach, he didn't confuse us with sessions straight out of the manual". Like Clough, Mills has been praised for his man management skills and Daren Fulford, his reserve-team manager at Tamworth, said: [...] "If he felt you had made a mistake, he would <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> rollicking but if he was pleased with you he would always give kind words". Fulford also commented on Mills' thoroughness, saying he wanted information on each players' performances after the reserves played.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{said that}} the {{recording}} of [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] {{was one of his}} most enjoyable moments in the studio. He stated, [...] "One of my favourite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably [...] "The Girl Is Mine", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it's never been shown." [...] He concluded, [...] "Maybe one day we'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sneak preview of it." [...] The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.|$|E

His father worked as a {{dispatcher}} at the Newport News shipyards, while {{his mother was a}} schoolteacher. Referred to as Lonnie by his family, Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother said that [...] "e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and when you found out about it, he would <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> big story." [...] Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.|$|E

500|$|When the Beach Boys {{needed to}} {{reproduce}} its sound onstage, Wilson first requested that Tanner play the Electro-Theremin {{live with the}} group, but he declined due to commitments.

[...] The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sears remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon [...] "so they could play the damn thing." [...] Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins. He later noted: [...] "The pop record scene cleaned us out of our stock which we expected to last through Christmas." ...|$|E
