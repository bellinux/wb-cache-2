40|$|L. <b>A.</b> Paul <b>has</b> {{recently}} argued that, on {{the standard}} model of rationality, individuals cannot make rational decisions about whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or not. In this paper, I show that Paul’s arguments do not plausibly demonstrate that the standard model of rationality precludes rational decisions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I argue that there are phenomenal and non-phenomenal values {{that can be used}} to determine the value that <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> will <b>have</b> for us and, in turn, {{that can be used to}} make rational decisions about whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or not. I also argue that we can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> approximate idea of what it is like for us to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> even before we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and that, {{on the standard}} model, this is sufficient to make rational decisions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child...</b>|$|R
40|$|Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, {{this article}} investigates {{the role of}} attitudes, {{subjective}} norms and perceived behavioural control on intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> comparing their effect on intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now with their effect on intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> during the next three years. Data from Norway (N = 1307) show that subjective norms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, {{the more likely they are}} to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now compared to within the next three years. Attitudes also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on differences in the timing of intentions, for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able to cope with having child are more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years. This effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R
30|$|Dommermuth et al. (2011) {{investigated}} {{the role of}} attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on the time frame in which individuals intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (‘now’ and ‘within the next three years’). They found that subjective norms <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of the intentions of childless people and one-child parents to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The more childless individuals and first-parity parents felt that their intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> were supported by their families and friends, the more likely they were to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in the short term (‘now’) compared to later (‘within the next three years’). Perceived behavioural control was a significant determinant for both groups: people who considered themselves better able to cope with <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> were more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> in the short term (‘now’) rather than later (‘within the next three years’). However, this effect disappeared when the authors controlled for demographic background variables.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the time frame of {{intentions}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> For both parents and childless people we compare those who want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now with those who intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> within the next three years. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and using data from Norway (N = 1307), we investigate the role of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on these two different time frames in fertility intention. The results show that subjective norms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} timing of intentions to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is supported by their families and friends, {{the more likely they are}} to want <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now compared to within the next three years. It also shows that positive attitudes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on intending to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than later for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able to cope with having child are more likely to intend to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> now rather than within the next three years. But this effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> varies considerably with personal circumstances...|$|R
40|$|It seems {{natural to}} choose whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> by {{reflecting}} {{on what it}} would be like to actually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I argue that this natural approach fails. If you choose to become a parent, and your choice is based on projections about what you think it would be like for you to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think it would be like for you to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. This suggests we should reject our ordinary conception of how to make this life-changing decision, and raises general questions about how to rationally approach important life choices...|$|R

5|$|A later {{record of}} Eastern Chalukyas {{mentions}} the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of Ayodhya came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess.

Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.|$|E

At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and the man was not the father.

Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test.

Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E

5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
