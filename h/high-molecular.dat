The catalyst-hydrocarbon mixture flows upward through the riser for a few seconds, and then the mixture is separated via cyclones. The catalyst-free hydrocarbons are routed to a main fractionator for separation into fuel gas, LPG, gasoline, naphtha, light cycle oils used in diesel and jet fuel, and heavy fuel oil.|$|E

50|$|Adiponectin {{automatically}} self-associates {{into larger}} structures. Initially, three adiponectin molecules bind {{together to form}} a homotrimer. The trimers continue to self-associate and form hexamers or dodecamers. Like the plasma concentration, the relative levels of the higher-order structures are sexually dimorphic, where females have increased proportions of the <b>high-molecular</b> weight forms. Recent studies showed that the <b>high-molecular</b> weight form may be the most biologically active form regarding glucose homeostasis. High-molecular-weight adiponectin was further found to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes with similar magnitude of association as total adiponectin.

5000|$|Staudinger’s {{groundbreaking}} elucidation of {{the nature}} of the <b>high-molecular</b> weight compounds he termed Makromoleküle paved the way for the birth of the field of polymer chemistry. Staudinger himself saw the potential for this science long before it was fully realized. “It is not improbable,” Staudinger smartly commented in 1936, “that sooner or later a way will be discovered to prepare artificial fibers from synthetic <b>high-molecular</b> products, because the strength and elasticity of natural fibers depend exclusively on their macro-molecular structure - i.e., on their long thread-shaped molecules.” Staudinger founded the first polymer chemistry journal in 1940, and in 1953 received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for “his discoveries in the field of macromolecular chemistry.” [...] In 1999, the American Chemical Society and Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker designated Staudinger's work as an International Historic Chemical Landmark. His pioneering research has afforded the world myriad plastics, textiles, and other polymeric materials which make consumer products more affordable, attractive and fun, while helping engineers develop lighter and more durable structures.|$|E

Epoxy compounds are also referred to as glycidyl compounds. The epoxy molecule can also be expanded or cross-linked with other molecules to form a wide variety of resin products, each with distinct performance characteristics. These resins range from low-viscosity liquids to <b>high-molecular</b> weight solids. Typically they are high-viscosity liquids.|$|E

The degradation products of hyaluronan, the oligosaccharides and very low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, exhibit pro-angiogenic properties. In addition, recent studies showed hyaluronan fragments, not the native <b>high-molecular</b> weight molecule, can induce inflammatory responses in macrophages and dendritic cells in tissue injury and in skin transplant ...|$|E

50|$|Unlike carboxysomes, pyrenoids are not {{delineated}} by {{a protein}} shell (or membrane). A starch sheath is often formed or deposited at {{the periphery of}} pyrenoids, even when that starch is synthesised in the cytosol {{rather than in the}} chloroplast. In Chlamydomonas, a <b>high-molecular</b> weight complex of two proteins (LCIB/LCIC) forms an additional concentric layer around the pyrenoid, outside the starch sheath, and this is currently hypothesised to act as a barrier to CO2-leakage or to recapture CO2 that escapes from the pyrenoid.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the representation of the LbL technique as a multilayer build-up based solely on electrostatic attraction is a simplification. Other interactions are involved in this process, including hydrophobic attraction. Multilayer build-up is enabled by multiple attractive forces acting cooperatively, typical for <b>high-molecular</b> weight building blocks, while electrostatic repulsion provides self-limitation of the absorption of individual layers. This range of interactions makes it possible to extend the LbL technique to hydrogen-bonded films, nanoparticles, similarly charged polymers, hydrophobic solvents, and other unusual systems.|$|E
50|$|LDL is not {{the only}} ligand for T-cadherin. <b>High-molecular</b> weight (HMW) {{complexes}} of adiponectin were suggested to be a specific ligand for T-cadherin. Adiponectin (adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa) is a cytokine produced by adipose tissue and its deficiency is associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, type II diabetes and atherosclerosis. Adiponectin binding to T-cadherin on vascular cells is associated with NF-kappa B activation. Two membrane adiponectin receptors with distant homology to seven-transmembrane spanning G-protein-coupled receptors, namely AdipoRl and AdipoR2 were identified in several tissues.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} leading organic chemists such as Emil Fischer and Heinrich Wieland {{believed}} that the measured high molecular weights were only apparent values caused by the aggregation of small molecules into colloids. At first the majority of Staudinger’s colleagues {{refused to accept the}} possibility that small molecules could link together covalently to form <b>high-molecular</b> weight compounds. As Mülhaupt aptly notes, this {{is due in part to}} the fact that molecular structure and bonding theory were not fully understood in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{there are}} five {{functional}} hyaluronidases: HYAL1, HYAL2, HYAL3, HYAL4 and HYAL5 (also known as SPAM1 or PH-20); plus a pseudogene, HYAL6 (also known as HYALP1). The genes for HYAL1-3 are clustered in chromosome 3, while HYAL4-6 are clustered in chromosome 7. HYAL1 and HYAL2 are the major hyaluronidases in most tissues. GPI-anchored HYAL2 is responsible for cleaving <b>high-molecular</b> weight HA, which is mostly bound to the CD44 receptor. The resulting HA fragments of variable size are then further hydrolized by HYAL1 after being internalized into endo-lysosomes; this generates HA oligosaccharides.|$|E

The Department of Physical and Colloid Chemistry students explore chemical phenomena using theoretical and experimental methods of physics. And finally the Department of Industrial Ecology students can master the environmental protection, waste utilization and other green technologies.|$|E
5000|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) {{is one of}} the most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries. It is widely used to convert the high-boiling, <b>high-molecular</b> weight hydrocarbon fractions of petroleum crude oils into more valuable gasoline, olefinic gases, and other products. [...] Cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons was originally done by thermal cracking, which has been almost completely replaced by {{catalytic cracking}} because it produces more gasoline with a higher octane rating. It also produces byproduct gases that have more carbon-carbon double bonds (i.e. more olefins), and hence more economic value, than those produced by thermal cracking.|$|E
5000|$|Ring-opening {{polymerization}} (ROP) {{has been}} used {{since the beginning of}} the 1900s in order to synthesize polymers.

[...] Many years later came the method of the ROP of anhydro sugars, providing polysaccharides, including synthetic dextran, xanthan gum, welan gum, gellan gum, diutan gum, and pullulan. Mechanisms and thermodynamics of ring-opening polymerization was further established in the 1950s. [...] The first <b>high-molecular</b> weight polymers (Mn up to 105) with a repeating unit were prepared by ROP as early as in 1976.|$|E
50|$|At present, over 400 {{workplace}} substances {{have been}} identified as having asthmagenic or allergenic properties.
