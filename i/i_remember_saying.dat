500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Morgain said, [...] "The {{main thing}} they wanted about Death {{coming to get}} people is that you never saw {{a kind of a}} Michael Myers figure. [...] You never saw a killer. [...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E

500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E

But we had a chat and he seemed like a nice enough guy. But I never heard back from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've got myself into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: which do you want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying,</b> and I think it's pretty close to the truth, that for a long time, Paul Darrow [...] never spoke a line that I hadn't written or altered to make the lines sharper".|$|E

6000|$|But {{here was}} a man who {{sincerely}} did not mind what people thought of him, and so convention had no hold on him; he was like a wrestler whose body is oiled; you could not get a grip on him; it gave him a freedom which was an outrage. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>saying</b> to him: ...|$|E
