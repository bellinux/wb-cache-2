25|$|The German Idealist philosopher Fichte had {{attempted}} {{to show that the}} whole structure of reality follows necessarily from the fact of self-consciousness. Schelling took Fichte's position as his starting-point, and in his earliest writings posited that nature must have reality for itself. In this light Fichte's doctrines appeared incomplete. On the one hand, they identified the ultimate ground of the universe of reason too closely with finite, individual Spirit. On the other, they threatened the reality of the world of nature by seeing <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in the manner of subjective idealism. Fichte, in this view, had not managed to unite his system with the aesthetic view of nature to which Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment had pointed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{results in}} the late 20th century, were not very {{promising}} for California winemakers. Poor site and clonal selection had the grape planted in vineyards that gave <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> exposure to the sun, producing wines that had {{little in common with}} the wines of Tuscany. The Antinori family, which once owned Atlas Peak Vineyards located in the Atlas Peak AVA in the foothills of Napa Valley found that the greater intensity of sunlight in California may have been one possible factor for the poorer quality. Today the style of these Californian Sangiovese tend to be more fruit-driven than their Tuscan counterparts with some floral notes. Recent years have focused on improving vineyard site and clonal selection as well as giving the vines time to age and develop in quality.|$|E

[...] After three interim editors-in-chief, Wikipedia user The ed17 took over in May 2012 as The Signpost eighth editor. He previously edited The Bugle, the publication of the WikiProject dedicated to improving the encyclopedia's military history articles.

500|$|Concerning the group's {{role in the}} Catholic Church, {{critics have}} argued that Opus Dei's unique status as a {{personal}} prelature gives <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> independence, making it essentially a [...] "church within a church" [...] and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself, as illustrated, for example, by the unusually rapid , which some considered to be irregular. In contrast, Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope, and {{its status as a}} prelature [...] "precisely means dependence." [...] Allen says that Escriva's relatively quick canonization does not {{have anything to do with}} power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II's decision to make Escriva's sanctity and message known.|$|E

In her later years, Wilson writes, Eddy concluded that individuals {{ought not to be}} [...] "taken up in thought," [...] and came to see animal magnetism as an impersonal force. From 1890 she felt that her students were focusing on <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> and thereafter public discussion of malicious animal magnetism declined, although Gottschalk adds that it continued {{to play an important role}} in the teaching of Christian Science. Adam H. Dickey, Eddy's private secretary for the last three years of her life, wrote that hour-long watches were held in her home three times a day to protect her against it. The Manual of the Mother Church forbids members from practising it, and requires that Christian Science teachers instruct students [...] "how to defend themselves against mental malpractice, and never to return evil for evil." ...|$|E

500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E
500|$|Historians Luciano Petech and Sato Hisashi {{argue that}} the Ming upheld a [...] "divide-and-rule" [...] policy towards a weak and {{politically}} fragmented Tibet after the Sakya regime had fallen. Chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the Yongle Emperor, as exclusive patronage to one Tibetan sect would have given <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> regional power. Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi. Norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based {{on the list of}} Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than [...] "comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet." [...] Rossabi states that this theory [...] "attributes too much influence to the Chinese," [...] pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began. Rossabi also discounts the [...] "divide-and-rule" [...] theory {{on the grounds of the}} Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa—one which he hoped would parallel Kublai Khan's earlier relationship with the Sakya Phagpa lama. Instead, the Yongle Emperor followed the Karmapa's advice of giving patronage to many different Tibetan lamas.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the memory of my father, and I couldn't do it to myself.

[...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000.

2500|$|Concerned that NBC's {{control of}} two {{national}} radio networks gave <b>it</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{power over the}} industry, in 1941 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated a rule designed to force NBC to divest one of them.

2500|$|While {{traveling}} to the United States after visiting his summer home in Ireland in November 1928, Robert Henri suffered an attack of neuritis, which crippled his leg. (The underlying cause was metastatic prostate cancer.) He was hospitalized at St. Luke's Hospital in New York. Gradually he became weaker, until he died of cardiac arrest {{early in the morning}} of July 12, 1929. His illness was not generally known, and came as a surprise in art circles.

2500|$|There is even {{a further}} {{suggestion}} that Drews has noticed. Why was the reversal of the order made? Evidently to bring the Intercession before the Consecration.

Now it is noticeable that Gelasius personally had a great reverence for the venerable [...] "second See" [...] founded by St. Mark, and that since 482 Bishop John Talaia of Alexandria, being expelled from his own Church by the Monophysites, sought and found refuge in Rome. He would have celebrated his own liturgy in the pope's city, and was certainly greatly honoured as a confessor and exile for the Faith.
