30|$|No {{matter in}} the process of DOA {{estimation}} or in beamforming, the influence of the <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> on target localization and identification is generally not trivial, especially when the <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> are spatially adjacent with the SOI in the presence of large power. If the <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> are suppressed or attenuated in advance, the performance of localization and waveform identification for SOI would be better. Haimovich and Bar-Ness [20], Haimovich [21], and Honig and Goldstein [22] proposed eigenanalysis-based interference canceler. Similarly, Gu and Leshem [23], Huang et al.

50|$|Star quad cables {{often use}} filler {{elements}} {{to hold the}} conductor centers in a symmetric four-point arrangement about the cable axis. All points of the star must lie at equal distances {{from the center of}} the star. When opposite points are connected together they act as if they are one conductor located at the center of the star. This configuration places the geometric center of each of the two legs of the balanced circuit in the center of the star. To a magnetic field, both legs of the balanced circuit appear to be in the exact center of the star. This means that both legs of the balanced circuit will receive exactly the same interference from the magnetic field and a common-mode <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> will be produced. This common-mode <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> will be rejected by the balanced receiver.|$|E

Such filters are required if the transmission line will use power-line communication techniques for communication and control, or if the overhead line will run through populated areas. These filters can be passive LC filters or active filters, consisting of an amplifier coupled through transformers and protection capacitors, which gives a signal out of phase to the <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> on the line, thereby cancelling it. Such a system was used on the Baltic Cable HVDC project.|$|E

30|$|Recall {{that the}} {{localization}} and waveform identification process in Section 3.2 requires known DOAs {{of all the}} incident signals, which is infeasible in practical applications. In this paper, it is considered that the DOA of the SOI is prior unavailable, and the prior DOAs of the <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> are also unknown. Toward the purpose, the presented localization and waveform identification process is implemented iteratively. The proposed OPLI firstly estimate {{the parameters of the}} SOI, so that a rough information of the SOI is available.

50|$|Fig. 2 {{illustrates}} a Twyman-Green interferometer {{set up for}} white light scanning of a macroscopic object. Light from the test specimen is mixed with light reflected from the reference mirror to form an interference pattern. Fringes appear in the CCD image only where the optical path lengths differ by {{less than half the}} coherence length of the light source, which is generally on the order of micrometers. The <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> (correlogram) is recorded and analyzed as either the specimen or reference mirror is scanned. The focus position of any particular point {{on the surface of the}} specimen corresponds to the point of maximum fringe contrast (i.e. where the modulation of the correlogram is greatest).|$|E
50|$|The {{interference}} occurs {{for white}} light when the path lengths of the measurement beam and the reference beam are nearly matched. By scanning (changing) the measurement beam path length {{relative to the}} reference beam, a correlogram is generated at each pixel. The width of the resulting correlogram is the coherence length, which depends strongly on the spectral width of the light source. A test surface having features of different heights leads to a phase pattern that is mixed with {{the light from the}} flat reference in the CCD image sensor plane. Interference occurs at the CCD pixel if the optical path lengths of the two arms differ less than half the coherence length of the light source. Each pixel of the CCD samples a different spatial position within the image of the test surface. A typical white light correlogram (<b>interference</b> <b>signal)</b> is produced when the length of the reference or measurement arm is scanned by a positioning stage through a path length match. The <b>interference</b> <b>signal</b> of a pixel has maximum modulation when the optical path length of light impinging on the pixel is exactly the same for the reference and the object beams. Therefore, the z-value for the point on the surface imaged by this pixel corresponds to the z-value of the positioning stage when the modulation of the correlogram is greatest. A matrix with the height values of the object surface can be derived by determining the z-values of the positioning stage where the modulation is greatest for every pixel. The vertical uncertainty depends mainly on the roughness of the measured surface. For smooth surfaces, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy of the positioning stage. The lateral positions of the height values depend on the corresponding object point that is imaged by the pixel matrix. These lateral coordinates, together with the corresponding vertical coordinates, describe the surface topography of the object.|$|E

Although this approach has excellent performance, it has a high computational complexity. In order to overcome this drawback, we introduce a modification that yields an efficient GPS AOA estimation algorithm, which is based on a modified despreader and the constant modulus (CM) array cost function. The CM array is capable of selecting signals that have a constant modulus while rejecting non-CM <b>interference</b> <b>signals.</b> The modified despreader is the mechanism that allows this to be achieved, where unlike the <b>interference</b> <b>signals,</b> the GPS signal of interest maintains a constant modulus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract | When the dierence of {{the signal}} power be-tween {{multiple}} <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> is very large, the con-ventional adaptive array can't remove all the <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> eectively. This causes a slow convergence rate and degrades {{the performance of the}} array system. The reason is that the adaptive array adapts only the interference sig-nal having the highest power. In this paper, we propose an improved adaptive array structure from the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) point of view. We uti-lize correlation improvement techniques between the input and the array output signals by controlling the gain of the array output signal. The proposed array called the auto-matic gain controlled (AGC) Applebaum array works well in multiple <b>interference</b> <b>signals</b> with dierent power levels.
