5|$|As before, once {{opposition}} to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired {{on the last day}} of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the Battle of Actium, Octavian decisively defeated Antony and Cleopatra in a naval battle near Greece, using <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> destroy the enemy fleet.|$|E
5|$|As {{the allies}} began {{to put their}} {{artillery}} into place, the British kept up a steady <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> disrupt them. British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make visits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire. On the night of October 2, the British opened a storm of <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> cover up {{the movement of the}} British cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party. On the 3rd, the foraging party, led by Banastre Tarleton, went out but collided with Lauzun's Legion, and John Mercer's Virginia militia, led by the Marquis de Choisy. The British cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines, losing 50 men.|$|E
5|$|Centralized {{artillery}} {{command and}} control. Since {{the end of}} World War I, German divisions had had their artillery spread out amongst their component regiments, which {{made it difficult to}} bring the maximum weight of <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> bear on any one point. Model reorganized his artillery into special battalions under the direct control of the divisional and corps commanders.|$|E
50|$|The ERT {{isolated}} as many fuel {{sources as}} possible and allowed smaller <b>fires</b> <b>to</b> burn off the uncontained hydrocarbons.

An anti-aircraft battery was located in Fort Supérieur. Four 155mm guns were located in Tournoux itself, 2.4 km to the northeast.|$|R

5|$|Chaparral {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> reproduce. The rare Gentner's fritillary also grows in this region.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{testimony}} {{focused on}} the theory that Tim Farrar, angry at his father, had set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> the home. Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the fight, the U.S. troops {{remained}} under intense mortar and small arms fire, before the Taliban fighters breached the compound and set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> it. Romesha moved under heavy <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> reconnoiter the area and seek reinforcements from a nearby barracks, helping the ISAF force to regroup and fight despite being targeted by a Taliban sniper. Romesha led the firefight to reclaim the depot, organizing a five-man team to counterattack while still under fire. He then neutralized one of the Taliban fighters' machine gun teams. While engaging a second, he took cover behind a generator which {{was struck by a}} rocket propelled grenade, and Romesha was wounded in the neck, shoulder and arms by shrapnel. Despite being wounded, Romesha directed air support that killed an estimated 30 Taliban and then took out several more Taliban positions himself. He provided suppressive <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> allow three other wounded American soldiers to reach an aid station and then recovered several American casualties while still under fire. Romesha's efforts allowed the troop to regroup and fight off a force superior in numbers. The fight lasted 12 hours, and eight American soldiers were killed, making the engagement one of the costliest for ISAF forces during the war. Nine soldiers were decorated with Silver Star Medals for the fight. Several days later, the ISAF forces withdrew from the post.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{portions}} of the Maginot Line, the Rhine defenses were not interconnected, consisting of individual casemates or blockhouses a few hundred meters apart, arranged <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> {{along the length of}} the defended frontier. In initial planning, a Maginot ouvrage with several combat blocks, interconnected and served by underground galleries, barracks and magazines, was planned for Oberroedern. The plan was reduced to two separate casemates, Oberroedern Nord and Sud. The casemate is arranged on two levels, with living facilities and utilities on the lower level and combat stations on the upper level. The casemate <b>fired</b> <b>to</b> the north and south along the casemate line, and an 37mm anti-tank gun/JM machine gun combination <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> the south and an AC37/JM <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> the north, with a JM machine gun <b>firing</b> <b>to</b> the west.. A GFM cloche on the top of the casemate allowed for protected observation. Firing ports for light automatic rifles covered the entrance and the area around the casemate.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a motte and bailey design, with the Baile Hill motte probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the motte. Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set <b>fire</b> <b>to</b> York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E
