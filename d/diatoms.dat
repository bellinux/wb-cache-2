40|$|The {{significance}} of silicon in the <b>diatom</b> bloom dynamics of eutrophicated Belgian coastal waters (Southern Bight of the North Sea) {{was assessed by}} investigating <b>diatom</b> species succession and silicification level (Si:C) in relation with environmental control during an annual cycle from early February to mid-December 1995. The Si:C of natural <b>diatom</b> communities was determined by 2 methods. The measurement of biogenic silica after alkaline digestion of particulate material and the estimate of <b>diatom</b> carbon biomass derived from microscope observations were performed on weekly samples from Stn 330 in Belgian coastal waters. Alternatively, parallel 24 h kinetics experiments of 32 Si uptake and 14 C incorporation into proteins, as an index of phytoplankton biomass production, into diatom-dominated natural communities were conducted in simulated natural conditions. The seasonal pattern of <b>diatom</b> growth was characterised by 3 <b>diatom</b> assemblages dominated by respectively small colonial species, Chaetoceros spp. - Schroederella sp. and Rhizosolenia spp. The colonial haptophyte Phaeocystis bloomed for 2 mo, co-occurring with the 2 latter <b>diatom</b> communities. The 3 <b>diatom</b> assemblages were characterised by distinct Si:C with values varying from 0. 80 to 0. 05 during the growing season. The Si:C of the blooming assemblages are discussed with respect to inter- and intra-specific variations based on changes in ambient controlling factors (nutrient, light and temperature) and compared with information available from the literature for individual <b>diatom</b> species. The results suggest that silicic acid availability controls the Si:C of the main <b>diatom</b> assemblages. This {{is supported by the}} positive relationship between the <b>diatom</b> Si:C and silicic acid concentrations. We conclude that silicic acid availability {{is an important factor in}} the selection of <b>diatom</b> species, shaping the <b>diatom</b> succession in temperate coastal waters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the epilithic <b>diatom</b> flora from rivers Vit and Osum. Twenty-eight sampling sites were chosen {{along the river}} catchments, from the springs to the inflows (the Danube River). A total of 114 <b>diatom</b> taxa (103 species and 11 varieties) from 36 genera were identified in the epilithon of the studied rivers. The epilithic <b>diatom</b> floras from rivers Vit and Osum had high floristic similarity, Cs = 0. 737 (with 66 common spesies). To characterize the <b>diatom</b> distributional patterns, nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used Two types of <b>diatom</b> assemblages were found throughout the studied rivers.

5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain <b>diatoms</b> of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of <b>diatoms,</b> across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds {{mainly on}} <b>diatoms</b> living on stones, {{scraping}} biofilms and also consuming detritus.

40|$|In the Julian Alps (Slovenia), the <b>diatom</b> {{communities}} of 16 mountain springs were studied between May and October 1999.

The <b>diatom</b> flora ofthese springs consisted of 60 <b>diatom</b> taxa and showed similarities with springs and headwater stream <b>diatom</b> communities from different geographic areas. Achnanthes minuttisima reached the highest relative abundance in most of the samples. Characteristic spring taxa (crenophiles) were present, but also included subdominant and rare taxa. Five different spring types were identified, with respect to <b>diatom</b> assemblages, using cluster analysis. Current velocity and periodical dryness in a spring appeared to be the dominant environmental factor affecting <b>diatom</b> distribution in selecting karstsprings.

5|$|From {{about three}} billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein {{families}} drive {{the evolution of}} selenocysteine, an amino acid. Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells {{seem to have a}} bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, <b>diatoms,</b> sea urchin, fish, and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. One family of selenium-bearing molecules (the glutathione peroxidases) destroys peroxide and repairs damaged peroxidized cell membranes, using glutathione. Another selenium-bearing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors.|$|E
5|$|In fact, tadpoles {{developing}} in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous. Pond tadpoles {{tend to have}} deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria. They also feed on <b>diatoms,</b> filtered from the water through the gills, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut {{to enable them to}} digest this diet. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) can occasionally be cannibalistic, the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.|$|E

5|$|In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, {{feeding on}} algae, <b>diatoms</b> or detritus, {{but in a}} few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into {{submerged}} wood and {{can be a problem}} for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems.

5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic <b>diatoms</b> and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on <b>diatoms</b> or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common mussel (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of these fossils {{is one of}} their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms, they would normally not fossilize and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the Burgess Shale or Solnhofen Limestone, the Ediacaran biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived. Their preservation was possibly enhanced by the high concentration of silica in the oceans before silica-secreting organisms such as sponges and <b>diatoms</b> became prevalent. Ash beds provide more detail and can readily be dated to the nearest million years or better using radiometric dating.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, <b>diatoms,</b> copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia in the groove push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, <b>diatoms,</b> flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} abundance of <b>diatom</b> species in different habitats {{can be used}} as a tool to infer prior environmental conditions and evaluate management decisions that influence habitat quality. <b>Diatom</b> distribution patterns were examined to characterize relationships between assemblage composition and environmental gradients in a subtropical estuarine watershed. We identified environmental correlates of <b>diatom</b> distribution patterns across the Charlotte Harbor, Florida, watershed; evaluated differences among three major river drainages; and determined how accurately local environmental conditions can be predicted using inference models based on <b>diatom</b> assemblages. Sampling locations ranged from freshwater to marine (0. 1 – 37. 2 ppt salinity) and spanned broad nutrient concentration gradients. Salinity was the predominant driver of difference among <b>diatom</b> assemblages across the watershed, but other environmental variables had stronger correlations with assemblages within the subregions of the three rivers and harbor. Eighteen indicator taxa were significantly affiliated with subregions. Relationships between <b>diatom</b> taxon distributions and salinity, distance from the harbor, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) were evaluated to determine the utility of <b>diatom</b> assemblages to predict environmental values using a weighted averaging-regression approach.
