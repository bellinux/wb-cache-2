40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to set general requirements for the fundamental RF power couplers under development for the Cornell University ERL project, specify major design challenges, consider design options, describe general approach to some calculations and present first ideas. 1. Coupler requirements and design challenges There are three different coupler types to be developed for the Cornell University ERL: for a buncher <b>cavity,</b> for five <b>injector</b> <b>cavities</b> and for five linac cavities. The buncher cavity is a normal-conducting single-cell cavity made of copper. It serves to produce an energy spread of about 10 keV in a σgun = 12 ps, 500 keV bunch coming from the gun so that the bunch will be shortened to σinjector = 2. 3 ps in a drift space between the buncher cavity and the first <b>injector</b> <b>cavity.</b> The five <b>injector</b> <b>cavities</b> are superconducting 2 -cell niobium structures. They provide 500 kW (limit is set by the input power coupler specifications) of RF power to the beam. Consequently the permitted beam current depends on the injector energy and varies from 100 mA at 5 MeV to 33 mA at 15 MeV. The five linac cavities are superconducting 9 -cell TESLA-style niobium cavities. Each cavity is operated at an accelerating gradient of 20 MV/m. The RF parameters of the buncher, <b>injector</b> and linac <b>cavities</b> [1] {{are listed in the}} table below. Some numbers in this table are preliminary as we are still working on the final designs. An overview of the ERL RF system can be found elsewhere [2].

This cryomodule has been installed in the Cornell ERL prototype, and is presently under extensive test. The combination of a high beam current with emittance preservation of an ultra low emittance beam results in a multitude of challenges for the SRF system, pushing parameters well beyond present state of the art. Strong HOM damping and effective HOM power extraction is required to support the 100 mA beam current. This is achieved by placing HOM beam line absorbers between all cavities. Emittance preservation is addressed by a symmetric beam line with twin input couplers, tight cavity alignment and the option of fine alignment of cold cavities.

It is attached to a suction hose (which usually is attached to a running water source and drain known as a hydroaspirator). The process of removing gas, fluids, and semi-solids from the body cavities and hollow organs using the trocar is known as aspiration. The instrument is inserted into the body two inches to the left and two inches up from the navel.

The injector was operated in the conventional mode with liquid being injected through its inner orifice and gas being injected through its outer annulus. The shearing action occurring at the liquid-gas interface causes the liquid jet to atomize. In this study, two different liquid-air systems, namely a water-air system and a liquid nitrogen-gaseous nitrogen system, were chosen for detailed investigation.

40|$|Several planned {{accelerator}} facilities {{call for}} hundreds of elliptical cavities operating cw with low effective beam loading, and therefore require cavities that have been mechanically optimized to operate at high Q_{L} by minimizing df/dp, the sensitivity to microphonics detuning from fluctuations in helium pressure. Without such an optimization, the facilities would suffer either power costs driven up by millions of dollars or an extremely high per-cavity trip rate. ANSYS simulations used to predict df/dp are presented {{as well as a}} model that illustrates factors that contribute to this parameter in elliptical cavities. For the Cornell Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) main linac cavity, df/dp is found to range from 2. 5 to 17. 4 [*][*]Hz/mbar, depending on the radius of the stiffening rings, with minimal df/dp for very small or very large radii. For the Cornell ERL <b>injector</b> <b>cavity,</b> simulations predict a df/dp of 124 [*][*]Hz/mbar, which fits well within the range of measurements performed with the injector cryomodule. Several methods for reducing df/dp are proposed, including decreasing the diameter of the tuner bellows and increasing the stiffness of the enddishes and the tuner. Using measurements from a Tesla Test Facility cavity as the baseline, if both of these measures were implemented and the stiffening rings were optimized, simulations indicate that df/dp would be reduced from ∼ 30 [*][*]Hz/mbar to just 2. 9 [*][*]Hz/mbar, and the power required to maintain the accelerating field would be reduced by an order of magnitude. Finally, other consequences of optimizing the stiffening ring radius are investigated. It is found that stiffening rings larger than 70 % of the iris-equator distance make the cavity impossible to tune. Small rings, on the other hand, leave the cavity susceptible to plastic deformation during handling and have lower frequency mechanical resonances, which is undesirable for active compensation of microphonics. Additional simulations of Lorentz force detuning are discussed, and the results are compared to measurements on the ERL <b>injector</b> <b>cavities...</b>|$|R

To this end, we establish a procedure for producing realistic field maps using lossless cavity eigenmode field solvers.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} {{in the design of}} a high bright-ness Energy Recovery Linac x-ray source is the preserva-tion of beam emittance. Discussed is one possible source of emittance dilution due to transverse electromagnetic fields in the accelerating cavities of the linac caused by the power coupler geometry. This has already been found to be a sig-nificant effect in Cornell’s ERL <b>injector</b> <b>cavities</b> if only one coupler per cavity is chosen. Here we present results of simulations for Cornell’s main ERL linac with six possible coupler configurations and compare them with regards to total emittance growth after one complete pass through the linac. We explain why the sign of the phase between the transverse kick and the accelerating force alternates each cavity when the cavities are arranged in a mirror symmet-ric way. In this case each cavity with its coupler before the structure is followed by one where the coupler is placed after the structure. This leads to a cancellation of the emit-tance growth to acceptable values. We find that cavity de-tuning of individual cavities does not destroy this cancella-tion.

There are several key issues that must be considered in the design of an efficient fuel injector. Of particular importance are the total pressure losses created by the injector and the injection processes that must be minimized since the losses reduce the thrust of the engine. In this analysis, the two-dimensional coupled implicit Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, the standard k-ε Turbulence model, sst-kω Turbulence and the eddy-dissipation reaction model have been employed to investigate the flow field in a hydrogen-fuelled scramjet combustor with a cavity design and to analyze the combustion processes. Numerical results are obtained with the fluent solving sst-kω Turbulence model to have the best results of all models. The grid independent test was also carried out. The profiles of static pressure, static temperature, and two components of velocity and mole fraction of hydrogen at various locations of the flow field are presented. Computed values using sst-kω turbulence model are found to have good overall agreement with results obtained from literature reviews and some discrepancies were observed for static pressure and static temperature in the vicinity of the jets due to unsteadiness in the shock system...|$|R
