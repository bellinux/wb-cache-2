40|$|Perpendicular blade vortex {{interactions}} {{are a common}} occurrence in helicopter rotor flows. Under certain conditions they produce a substantial proportion of the acoustic noise. However, the mechanism of noise generation is not well understood. Specifically, turbulence associated with the trailing vortices shed from the blade tips appears insufficient {{to account for the}} noise generated. The hypothesis that the first perpendicular interaction experienced by a trailing vortex alters its turbulence structure {{in such a way as}} to increase the acoustic noise generated by subsequent interactions is examined. To investigate this hypothesis a two-part investigation was carried out. In the first part, experiments were performed to examine the behavior of a streamwise vortex as it passed over and downstream of a spanwise blade in incompressible <b>flow.</b> <b>Blade</b> vortex separations between +/- one eighth chord were studied for at a chord Reynolds number of 200, 000. Three-component velocity and turbulence measurements were made in the flow from 4 chord lengths upstream to 15 chordlengths downstream of the blade using miniature 4 -sensor hot wire probes. These measurements show that the interaction of the vortex with the blade and its wake causes the vortex core to loose circulation and diffuse much more rapidly than it otherwise would. Core radius increases and peak tangential velocity decreases with distance downstream of the blade. True turbulence levels within the core are much larger downstream than upstream of the blade. The net result is a much larger and more intense region of turbulent flow than that presented by the original vortex and thus, by implication, a greater potential for generating acoustic noise. In the second part, the turbulence measurements described above were used to derive the necessary inputs to a Blade Wake Interaction (BWI) noise prediction scheme. This resulted in significantly improved agreement between measurements and calculations of the BWI noise spectrum especially for the spectral peak at low frequencies, which previously was poorly predicted...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and computational study, {{motivated by the}} need to improve current understanding of blade flutter in turbomachinery and provide 3 D test data for the validation of advanced computational methods for the prediction of this aeroelastic phenomenon, is presented. A new, low speed flutter test facility has been developed to facilitate a detailed investigation into the unsteady aerodynamic response of a turbine blade oscillating in a three dimensional bending mode. The facility employs an unusual configuration in which a single turbine blade is mounted in a profiled duct and harmonically driven. At some cost in terms of modelling a realistic turbomachinery configuration, this offers an important benefit of clearly defined boundary conditions, which has proved troublesome in previous work performed in oscillating cascade experiments. Detailed measurement of the unsteady blade surface pressure response is enabled through the use of externally mounted pressure transducers, and an examination of the techniques adopted and experimental error indicate a good level of accuracy and repeatability to be attained in the measurement of unsteady pressure. A detailed set of steady flow and unsteady pressure measurements, obtained from five spanwise sections of tappings between 10 % and 90 % span, are presented for a range of reduced frequency. The steady flow measurements demonstrate a predominant two-dimensional steady flow, whilst the blade surface unsteady pressure measurements reveal a consistent three dimensional behaviour of the unsteady aerodynamics. This is most especially evident in the measured amplitude of blade surface unsteady pressure which is largely insensitive to the local bending amplitude. An experimental assessment of linearity also indicates a linear behaviour of the unsteady aerodynamic response of the oscillating turbine blade. These measurements provide the first three dimensional test data of their kind, which may be exploited towards the validation of advanced flutter prediction methods. A three dimensional time-marching Euler method for the prediction of unsteady flows around oscillating turbomachinery blades is described along with the modifications required for simulation of the experimental test configuration. Computationalsolutions obtained from this method, which are the first to be supported by 3 D test data, are observed to exhibit a consistently high level of agreement with the experimental test data. This clearly demonstrates the ability of the computational method to predict the relevant unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon and indicates the unsteady aerodynamic response to be largely governed by inviscid flow mechanisms. Additional solutions, obtained from a quasi- 3 D version of the computational method, highlight the strong three dimensional behaviour of the unsteady aerodynamics and demonstrate the apparent inadequacies of the conventional quasi- 3 D strip methodology. A further experimental investigation was performed {{in order to make a}} preliminary assessment of the previously unknown influence of tip leakage flow on the unsteady aerodynamic response of oscillating turbomachinery blades. This was achievedthrough the acquisition of a comprehensive set of steady flow and unsteady pressure measurements at three different settings of tip clearance. The steady flow measurements indicate a characteristic behaviour of the tip leakage flow throughout the range of tip clearance examined, thereby demonstrating that despite the unusual configuration, the test facility provides a suitable vehicle for the investigation undertaken. The unsteady pressure data show the blade surface unsteady pressure response between 10 % and 90 % span to be largely unaffected by the variation in tip clearance. Although close examination of the unsteady pressure measurements reveal subtle trends in the first harmonic pressure response at 90 % span, which are observed to coincide with localised regions where the tip leakage flow has a discernible impact on the steady <b>flow</b> <b>blade</b> loading characteristic.

40|$|Horizontal axis wind {{turbines}} have {{to withstand a}} wide range of atmospheric operating conditions from turbulent inflow to stand still. This can lead to airfoil incidence angles from any direction including reverse <b>flow.</b> <b>Blade</b> element methods require aerodynamic airfoil coefficients for the computation of the aerodynamic loads on the rotor blade. The state of the art method to acquire these aerodynamic coefficients is to take the polars from - 30 ° to + 30 ° from either wind tunnel experiments or CFD calculations and to extend it by the analogy of the flat plate (e. g. the post stall model from Montgomery 1). One problem of this approach is the discontinuity at the junction between the measured and the extended data due to different levels of physical modelling. Furthermore the flat plate analogy {{does not take into account}} effects like surface curvature or camber. For the data taken from wind tunnel experiments large test models and test sections are needed in order to meet the demanding requirements of the high Reynolds numbers typically encountered on modern wind turbine rotor blades. In contrast to that, CFD methods are less time consuming, especially when a lot of different airfoil geometries have to be investigated. At high angles of attack (AoAs) the flow separation from the airfoil leads to unsteady aerodynamical effects. Higher-order CFD methods such as Large Eddy Simulation and Direct Numerical Simulation would disclose a precise aerodynamic but exceed an appropriate effort for the whole range of AoAs and airfoil types. Due to the time efficiency aspect the steady RANS computation was chosen as simulation method for the DLR TAU code. The goal was to find one robust CFD setup with one mesh topology that allows the computation for the whole range of AoAs and of all airfoils in order to get smooth slopes in the aerodynamic coefficients. For the present paper five airfoils of the FFA-W 3 -xxx series 2 used on the DTU 10 MW wind turbine 3 were chosen. The airfoils have a relative thickness from t/c= 24. 1 % up to t/c= 60 % whereby some airfoils are equipped with a gurney flap. The flow conditions vary from Re= 6 x 106 to Re= 12 x 106 and M= 0. 058 to M= 0. 265 and, therefore, are in accordance with the rated operating condition of the rotor. Two different turbulence models (one-equation SA-neg and two-equation Menter-SST) were tested, whereas the SA-neg model was favored for the final simulations. The SA-neg model was originally developed for under-resolved grids and unphysical transient states resulting in a more stable solution in difficult flow conditions. It has been found out that the laminar-turbulent transition may not be neglected as it has an important impact on the suction peak even at high AoAs. The transition prediction has been performed by the eN method using the linear stability theory. Particularly for thick airfoils with large nose radius the consideration of transition affects the lift coefficient up to 0. 4 and the drag coefficient up to 0. 2. In few cases the flow solution did not converge. The respective points were excluded and interpolated by a higher order polynomial. This methodology was compared to the classical approach by which the aerodynamic coefficients in the range from - 30 ° to + 30 ° were computed by CFD and extended by the analogy of the flat plate. It can be shown that the presented methodology resolves physical effects in the coefficient shape in a more sophisticated manner. Furthermore the data are more consistent than the classical approach...|$|E

40|$|Cycloturbines and cyclorotors are {{established}} concepts for extracting freesteam fluid energy and producing thrust which promise {{to exceed the}} performance of traditional horizontal axis turbines and rotors while maintaining unique operational advantages. However, their potential is not yet realized in widespread applications. A central barrier to their proliferation {{is the lack of}} fundamental understanding of the aerodynamic interaction between the turbine and the freestream flow. In particular, blade pitch must be precisely actuated throughout the revolution to achieve the proper blade angle of attack and maximize performance. So far, there is no adequate method for determining or implementing the optimal blade pitching kinematics for cyclorotors or cycloturbines. This dissertation bridges the pitching deficiency by introducing a novel low order model to predict improved pitch kinematics, experimentally demonstrating improved performance, and evaluating flow physics with a high order Navier-Stokes computational code. ^ The foundation for developing advanced blade pitch motions is a low order model named Fluxline Theory. Fluid calculations are performed in a coordinate system fixed to streamlines whose spatial locations are not pre-described in order to capture the flow expansion/contraction and bending through the turbine. A transformation then determines the spatial location of streamlines through the rotor disk and finally blade element method integrations determine the power and forces produced. Validation against three sets of extant cycloturbine experimental data demonstrates improvement over other existing streamtube models. ^ Fluxline Theory was extended by removing dependence on a blade element model to better understand how turbine-fluid interaction impacts thrust and power production. This pure momentum variation establishes a cycloturbine performance limit similar to the Betz Limit for horizontal axis wind turbines, as well as the fluid deceleration required to achieve optimum performance. A novel inverse method was developed implementing a new semi-empirical curvilinear <b>flow</b> <b>blade</b> aerodynamic coefficient model to predict optimum cycloturbine blade pitch waveforms from the ideal fluid deceleration. ^ These improved blade pitch waveforms were evaluated on a 1. 37 m diameter by 1. 37 m span cycloturbine to definitively characterize their improvement over existing blade pitch motions and demonstrate the practicality of a variable blade pitch system. The Fluxline Optimal pitching kinematics outperformed sinusoidal and fixed pitching kinematics. The turbine achieved a mean gross aerodynamic power coefficient of 0. 44 (95 % confidence interval: [0. 388, 0. 490]) and 0. 52 (95 % confidence interval: [0. 426, 0. 614]) at tip speed ratios (TSRs) of 1. 5 and 2. 25 respectively which exceeds all other low TSR vertical axis wind turbines. Two-dimensional incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamic simulations were used to characterize higher order effects of the blade interaction with the fluid. These simulations suggest Fluxline Optimal pitch kinematics achieve high power coefficients by evenly extracting energy from the flow without blade stall or detached turbine wakes. ^ Fluxline Theory was adapted to inform the design of high efficiency cyclorotors by incorporating the concept of rotor angle of attack as well as a power and drag loss model for blade support structure. A blade element version of this theory predicts rotor performance. For hovering, a simplified variation of the theory instructs that cyclorotors will achieve the greatest power loading at low disk loadings with high solidity blades pitched to maximum lift coefficient. Increasing lift coefficients in the upstream portion of the rotor disproportionately increases performance compared to magnifying lift in the downstream portion. This suggests airfoil sections that counter curvilinear flow effects could improve hovering efficiency. Additionally, the simplified hovering theory explains the cyclorotor side force which was observed experimentally, but never adequately explained. In contrast, a separate simplified version of the theory for high speed forward flight points to better rotor performance with a low solidity, high disk loading rotor operated at high advance ratios. High rotor aspect ratios will improve performance in both hover and forward flight. ^ A new mechanical blade pitch mechanism was designed to actuate the high efficiency blade pitch motions predicted by Fluxline Theory for both cyclorotors and cycloturbines. The mechanism optimizes blade pitch at all operating conditions via different cross sections of a three dimensionally contoured cam. Varying the position of the cam accounts for changing wind direction and velocity on a cycloturbine, or for pilot-controlled thrust vectoring, forward speed, and aircraft angle of attack as a cyclorotor. A simplified variation of the mechanism, which implemented fully aerodynamically-shrouded blade pitch links, performed flawlessly on the cycloturbine experiment. ...|$|E
40|$|The analysis, {{modeling}} {{and design of}} the lift-driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) has challenged the wind energy community for many decades; this limited progress in knowledge has severely impaired {{the development of the}} VAWT, giving rise to the myth that the VAWT rotor is inherently inefficient (in comparison with the more conventional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine - HAWT) or too complex for commercial implementation. In this research work, we take a new path on the analysis of the VAWT: instead of considering a rotor that creates a perturbation on the flow (wake and induction field), we consider an unsteady wake, to which a rotor energy-conversion system is associated, obtaining the loading on the blade by better understanding the flow. The research aims at understanding the wake and its relation with energy conversion and the loading on the rotor system. Four main questions drive this research:  What is the relation between blade loading and energy conversion?  How does the near wake of the VAWT develop?  What is the difference between the 2 D and the 3 D wake?  How does understanding the near wake improve our design? At the end of this dissertation we achieve a clear and insightful view on the 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics {{from the point of view}} of the wake, that significantly improves the aerodynamic design and optimization of new VAWT rotors for energy conversion and propulsion, opening a new design space and methodology. The results and discussion presented in this dissertation are organized in five steps (see thesis outline, Chapter 1) :  Part I: understand the fundamental VAWT aerodynamics and how these relate with the research presented in this dissertation.  Part II: understand the energy exchange process in the 2 D plane by understanding the shedding of the wake over the rotation, and the wake expansion in 2 D. Analyze the impact of dynamic stall on the near wake evolution, and how to extract blade load information from the near wake in dynamic stall.  Part III: understand the impact of the spanwise dimension of the rotor and the role of the consequent trailing vorticity. Investigate the little known skewed flow.  Part IV: understand better the energy exchange process, the wake’s generation and the decoupling between loading and energy conversion. Propose new approaches and guidelines for the aerodynamic rotor design.  Part V: discuss the main results and conclusions of the research, and its impact on new aerodynamic research and design approaches, both for 2 D and 3 D VAWT rotors. In Part I (Chapter 2) we frame our research approach, analyzing the VAWT from a wake perspective, by considering both 2 D and 3 D aerodynamics of the VAWT at two different scales: aerofoil/blade scale and rotor scale. We divide the rotor in windward (315 ? < ? < 45 ?), upwind (45 ?< ? < 135 ?), leeward (135 ? < ? < 225 ?) and downwind (225 ? < ? < 315 ?) regions of the rotation. This approach obsolesces the conventional division of the rotor into upwind and downwind halves; while the upwind/downwind division is driven by angle of attack considerations (blade loading problem), this new segmentation is determined by the shedding of vorticity (energy conversion problem), a more useful and effective approach. The wake is also split into shed vorticity due to the time gradient of the bound circulation, and trailing vorticity due to the spatial gradient of the bound circulation; this division leads to our 2 D and 3 D analysis of the flow. In Part II, we analyze the 2 D rotor and wake at two scales: rotor and blade. The two flow scales are obviously related, in the sense that the rotor’s aerodynamics are the result of the wakes generated at the several blades and the blade experiences an induction field due to the vorticity distributed over the wake at the rotor scale. The separation in blade and rotor scale is in fact a separation of two views on the total system:  The rotor, as an energy exchange system, where the energy exchange results in a wake and streamline expansion.  The blade, as an aerodynamic loading system, where the design-objective loading is associated with an equivalent bound circulation. The time variation of this bound circulation results in a shed wake. The 2 D potential-flow analysis (Chapter 3) shows that:  the conventional breakdown of the VAWT into upwind and downwind actuator systems is incorrect, leading to an overestimation of energy conversion on the upwind half of the rotation and an underestimation in the downwind half.  contrary to the HAWT, the induction is not a function of the total loading, but only of the load component associated with the azimuthally varying circulation.  it is possible to significantly improve Double Multiple Streamtube models by incorporating a better description of the flow. The proposed improved model clearly surpasses conventional models on the prediction of the induction and loading.  the impact of the blade bound-circulation constant-term is small in comparison to the time-varying bound-circulation term; therefore, the induction field of the 2 D VAWT in potential flow can be defined by only the number of blades, rotor solidity and tip-speed ratio. This allows for the obsolescence of streamtube momentum models, replaced by faster and more accurate potential flow vortex models. In Chapters 4 and 5 we visualize and quantify, experimentally and numerically, the flow field in the near wake of the blade during the upwind and leeward segments of the motion, at tip-speed ratios ? = 2, 3 and 4, using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). An interesting physical aspect of the vortical flow in dynamic stall, especially at low tip-speed ratios, is the transport of the shed vorticity with the blade. This transport of the vortical structures with the blade means that the geometry of the wake, due to viscous effects, differs from what is obtained with potential flow. A different spatial distribution of the shed vorticity implies a different induction field, which might imply a reduction of the effectiveness of momentum models and simple potential-flow models and change the rotor’s performance. The results show two important effects:  At the rotor scale, the transport of vorticity with the blade, rolled in the leading edge/trailing edge separated vortices.  At the blade scale, the importance of the small scale vortices for the oscillations on pressure distribution and loads. In Chapter 6 we use the experimental and numerical data from the previous chapters to evaluate the feasibility of extracting information from the flow/wake measured with PIV, even in dynamic stall, for improving flow analysis and model validation. In Part III we introduce the fourth dimension of our problem: the spanwise direction. The finite span leads to a non-constant spanwise distribution of circulation on the blade, and this distribution leads to the release of trailing vorticity, of which the blade tip vortex is the most prominent component. In Chapter 7 we measure the wake at the tip-vortex region of the VAWT; in Chapter 8 we combine these experimental results with 3 D unsteady free-wake potential-flow simulations to:  experimentally and numerically observe, quantify and analyze the generation and convection of the 3 D tip vortex of the VAWT.  experimentally, numerically and analytically investigate the effect of blade-tip shape on the generation and convection of the tip vortex, with focus on the added circulation due to the motion of the blade.  combine experimental measurements and numerical simulations to analyze: the 3 D wake of the VAWT; the interaction between shed and trailing vorticity; the roll-up and expansion of the wake in the leeward and windward regions; the in-rotor convection and inboard/outboard motion of the tip vortex; the 3 D induction field; the 3 D blade wake interaction during the downwind blade passage; and the effect of trailing vorticity in the spanwise distribution of circulation, including the 2 D to 3 D load direction reversal in the downwind blade passage. The spanwise dimension of the flow also gives rise to a new form of misalignment between the flow and the axis: skewed flow. In Chapter 9 we analyze the physics of skewed flow, flow asymmetry, near wake development, blade-wake interaction and impact on energy conversion. The analysis of the VAWT from the point of view of the 2 D and 3 D near wake is shown to be very effective in understanding: the physics of the flow; the energy exchange process; how the total energy exchange over one rotation actually relates to the local aerodynamic loading on the blade; the impact of implementing an essentially 2 D energy conversion process into a 3 D aerodynamic system; and the resulting inefficiencies due to the finite span and trailing vorticity. In Part IV (Chapter 10) we show that it is possible to decompose the VAWT design problem into designing for loading and designing for energy conversion, opening a large design space and proposing a new methodology, impacting both 2 D and 3 D flow. We also show that, although the 2 D wake does not vary significantly with variation in the pitching axis location and blade camber, the 3 D wake and performance are significantly affected by these variations. This is due to the impact that varying the bound circulation has on the release of trailing vorticity; a larger trailing vorticity generated during the upwind blade passage implies a larger induction due to trailing vorticity, and a worse interaction at the downwind blade passage. The effects of variation of camber and/or pitching axis in 2 D and 3 D performance are contradictory and complementary and can be simultaneously optimized. In Part V (Chapter 11) we further develop these and other main conclusions, discussing their impact on VAWT aerodynamics. The research here presented implies a break from conventional approaches to the VAWT aerodynamics, allowing for the development of new research and models, both in 2 D flow (aerofoil design, rotor energy conversion optimization) and 3 D <b>flow</b> (<b>blade</b> and rotor shape, non-uniform flows) ...|$|E

Characteristics of design under hyper-normal factors are pointed out. Software of hydraulic design for lower specific speed axial <b>flow</b> runner <b>blades</b> has been developed by Visual Basic and AutoCAD basing on the method of singular point distribution. Finally, an example to demonstrate and explain its use is given in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{performance of}} turbine nozzle blades {{designed for a}} constant discharge angle was investigated at discharge hub Mach numbers of 1. 18, 1. 31, and 1. 41. Flow characteristics are presented in terms of energy losses, angle gradients, and secondary <b>flow</b> effects. <b>Blade</b> efficiency decreased from 0. 983 to 0. 978 with increasing Mach number in the range investigated while angle variations in the loss regions became very large, indicating poorer blade performance than efficiency implies...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedResults of an experimental program {{to measure the}} performance of a compressor stator cascade consisting of 20 DCA blades of chord 5. 01 inches, aspect ratio 2. 0 and solidity 1. 67 under conditions of varying incidence angle and Reynolds number are reported. <b>Flow</b> quality and <b>blade</b> performance data were obtained using pneumatic probe surveys and surface pressure measurements. Changes in Reynolds number in the range of 500, 000 to 770, 000 did not measurably effect either <b>flow</b> quality or <b>blade</b> performance. Changes in incidence angle over the range - 15 to 10 degrees produced generally well behaved blade performance parameters. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{main cause}} of {{compressor}} blade disruption under the given temperatures is corrosion and erosion which appear due to the interaction of dusted air <b>flow</b> with <b>blade</b> surfaces. It requires new technological solutions {{for the development of}} coatings that provide safe operation of aircrafts. One of the solutions to this problem is the creation of multi-layer functional coatings possessing both thermal stability and erosion resistance properties, and able to withstand the action of high-temperature air stream for a long time...|$|R
40|$|A vortex {{shedding}} model is developed {{to predict the}} flow fields around turbine flowmeter blades. This model is used to simulate the flow separation and reattachment in the leading edge areas and the wake <b>flows</b> of the <b>blades.</b> Lewis's inverse blade design method is developed and quite successfully applied to simulate the displacement effect of the separation bubbles in the leading edge areas. A new method is introduced to apply the Kutta condition in unsteady <b>flows</b> around the <b>blades</b> wi th separation points on a blade surface or the <b>flow</b> with <b>blade</b> interaction. This method {{does not require a}} large amount of iterative calculation. A model is built up to predict the turbine flowmeter performance when the inlet flow conditions are known. The panel method is applied to predict the inlet flow conditions for the cases without inlet swirl. An experimental study of the flow inside a turbine flowmeter is carried out using Laser Doppler Anemometry(LDA) to measure the throughout velocity fields around a flowmeter at different flowrates and with different inlet swirls. A clear picture of the flow field is thus obtained. The measured resul ts are also used to validate the developed turbine flowmeter performance prediction model. The numerical prediction are tested with experimental results. The theoretical and experimental data agree with each other very well in the cases without inlet swirl and reasonably ",ell in other tested cases with inlet swirl...|$|R

Stalling occurs only if there is insufficient air entering into the fan blades causing separation of <b>flow</b> on the <b>blade</b> surface. Surging or the Unstable flow causing complete breakdown in fans is mainly contributed by the three factors ...|$|R
