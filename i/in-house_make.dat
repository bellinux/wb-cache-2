Based on a longitudinal data set comprising three cross sections (1999, 2002, and 2005) of the Swiss innovation survey, four different types of R&D strategies could have been separated; firms combine in-house R&D with R&D co-operations (coop), or in-house R&D with external R&D (buy), or they conduct in-house R&D, external R&D and R&D co-operations (mixed), or they exclusively rely on <b>in-house</b> R&D (<b>make).</b> It is {{the aim of this}} paper to understand what drives firms to go for different strategies.

40|$|Significant {{empirical}} {{data from the}} fields of management and business strategy {{suggest that it is}} a good idea for a company to <b>make</b> <b>in-house</b> the components and processes underpinning a new technology. Other evidence suggests exactly the opposite, saying that firms would be better off buying components and processes from outside suppliers. One possible explanation for this lack of convergence is that earlier research in this area has overlooked two important aspects of the problem: reputation and trust. To gain insight into how these variables may impact make-buy decisions throughout the innovation process, the Sporas algorithm for measuring reputation was added to an existing agent-based model of how firms interact with each other throughout the development of new technologies. The model�s results suggest that reputation and trust do not play a significant role in the long-term fortunes of an individual firm as it contends with technological change in the marketplace. Accordingly, this model serves as a cue for management researchers to investigate more thoroughly the temporal limitations and contingencies that determine how the trust between firms may affect the R&D process...|$|R
40|$|Tissue microarrays are {{a recent}} {{innovation}} {{in the field of}} pathology. They were originally designed as a high-throughput approach for researchers to assess the expression of interesting candidate disease-related genes or gene products simultaneously on hundreds of tissue samples. However, their use is becoming more widespread in routine pathology, for example for quality assurance and for the optimisation of diagnostic reagents such as monoclonal antibodies and gene probes. Several molecular and conventional pathological techniques can be performed on a single tissue array, thereby enabling morphology, DNA, RNA and protein targets to be analysed on sequential sections through multiple tissue samples. Moreover, compared with full-face tissue sections, tissue microarrays are a cost- and time-efficient, effective approach to analysing biomarker expression on a large number of samples. Whilst tissue microarrays are available from commercial sources, many pathology laboratories prefer to <b>make</b> <b>in-house</b> arrays from their often extensive pathology archive to facilitate the correlation of their findings with clinical parameters.

This study investigates the extent of such outsourcing and examines inter-industry variation {{in the use of}} in-house rather than independent advertising agencies by U. S. advertisers. While the vast majority of large advertisers employ outside agencies, it comes as a surprise to find that when advertisers of all sizes are considered, about half operate some form of in-house agency. Internalization of advertising services is much more widespread than has hitherto been appreciated and varies widely across industries. To explain this variation, we draw on concepts from research on scale economies and transaction costs to develop a set of hypotheses which we test in cross sectional analyses of data covering 69 two digit SIC industries at two points in time, 1991 and 1999. Across industries, we find that the likelihood of internalization of advertising services decreases as the size of advertising outlays increase but increases as advertising intensity and technological intensity increase and is greater for "creative" industries.

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore how people with SMI experienced sheltered housing consisting of both a private fully equipped apartment and a shared accommodation room for socializing. Methods: Fourteen people with SMI living in sheltered housing apartments participated in a qualitative study with semi-structured face to face individual or group interviews. Results Residents’ access to the service providers in the sheltered housing, who were seen as both “ordinary people” and skilled to observe symptom changes at an early stage, were major factors for the perception of security. In addition, residents highlighted the possibility of living in a fully equipped apartment, and having access to a shared accommodation room to connect with other residents. Having a fully equipped apartment including their own equipment such as a washing machine was said to help reduce conflicts. Short tenancy agreements made some informants feel insecure. It was also essential to have meaningful daily activities outside the residence to avoid re-hospitalization. Conclusions: The positive experience was connected to having a fully private equipped apartment including shared accommodation room.

40|$|Currently, {{magnetic}} iron oxide nanoparticles are the only nano-sized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents approved for clinical use, yet commercial manufacturing of these agents has been limited or discontinued. Though there is still widespread demand for these particles both for clinical use and research, they are difficult to obtain commercially, and complicated syntheses <b>make</b> <b>in-house</b> preparation infeasible for most biological research labs or clinics. To make commercial production viable and increase accessibility of these products, {{it is crucial to}} develop simple, rapid, and reproducible preparations of biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles. Here, we report a rapid, straightforward microwave-assisted synthesis of superparamagnetic dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were produced in two hydrodynamic sizes with differing core morphologies by varying the synthetic method as either a two-step or single step process. A striking benefit of these methods is the ability to obtain swift and consistent results without the necessity for air, pH, or temperature sensitive techniques; therefore, reaction times and complex manufacturing processes are greatly reduced as compared to conventional synthetic methods. This is a great benefit for cost-effective translation to commercial production. The nanoparticles are found to be superparamagnetic and exhibit properties consistent for use in MRI. In addition, the dextran coating imparts the water-solubility and biocompatibility necessary for in vivo utilization. Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we present}} results from various methods of tunneling spectroscopy in carbon nanotubes, which {{shed light on}} electron ??? electron interaction in carbon nanotubes and low dimensional systems in general.

Some of the techniques are standard in nanofabrication, and some were developed <b>in-house</b> to <b>make</b> the particular device geometries studied here possible. In particular, we developed recipes for the growth and contact of clean, ultra-long carbon nanotubes {{as well as for the}} fabrication of non-invasive top tunnel probes. We then present results on normal metal tunneling spectroscopy of carbon nanotube devices of varying length. We measure the exponent of the conductance power law in the density of states as a function of device length over two orders of magnitude and find unexpected evidence of finite size effects in long devices. Next, we present results from the first measurement of the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution function in carbon nanotubes measured via non-equilibrium superconducting tunneling spectroscopy and find little evidence of scattering at low temperatures, which is consistent with a clean, strongly interacting Luttinger liquid. In addition, we discuss two ways we are working to extend this powerful technique. We also present results of superconducting tunneling spectroscopy of a clean carbon nanotube quantum dot. We are able to characterize the energy spectrum of the quantum dot and distinguish between spin singlet and spin triplet shell filling. We observe elastic and inelastic co-tunneling features which are not visible when the probe is made normal by a magnetic field. These co-tunneling rates have important technological implications for carbon nanotubes as single electron transistors. We also observe an energetically forbidden conductance inside the superconducting gap that could be related to inelastic scattering in the carbon nanotube quantum dot. Finally, we present results from the first application of the superconducting tunneling spectroscopy technique to graphene, a two dimensional system. We observe conductance oscillations consistent with Fabry-Perot interference. We also observe a gate dependant pair of subgap peaks, symmetric about bias voltage. We hypothesize that these peaks are due to conductance through bound Andreev states confined to a graphene quantum dot below the superconducting tunnel probe...|$|R
40|$|Software {{evolution}} {{is a crucial}} activity for software organizations. A specifc type of software {{evolution is}} the integration of previously isolated systems. The need for integration is often a consequence of different organizational changes, including merging of previously separate organizations. One goal of software integration {{is to increase the}} value to users of several systems by combining their functionality, another is to reduce functionality overlap. If the systems are completely owned and controlled in-house, there is an additional advantage in rationalizing the use of internal resources by decreasing the amount of software with essentially the same purpose. Despite in-house integration being common, this topic has received little attention from researchers. This thesis contributes to an increasing understanding of the problems associated with in-house integration and provides guidelines to the more efficient utilization of the existing systems and the personnel. In the thesis, we combine two perspectives: software architecture and processes. The perspective of software architecture is used to show how compatibility analysis and development of integration alternatives can be performed rapidly at a high level of abstraction.

40|$|A prime {{question}} that has dominated much of strategic management research is: What determines superior firm performance? Over almost two decades, scholars have sought to examine the role of various factors that could possibly influence business performance of a firm. This is because regardless of the country‘s boundary consumers {{from other parts of}} the world, in fact, have financially benefited from continuous escalation on volume of products of lower prices imported from developing countries. The increased pressures from fickle consumers and uncertain business environment are making more and more firms to recognize the strategic role in the rapid change of business environment. The firms ought to have the capability of responding the changing business environment efficiently and effectively, where sourcing can play a significant role in order to achieve sustainable competitive advantage (Bruce & Daly, 2011; Gligor & Holcomb, 2014; MacCarthy & Jayarathne, 2012). Firms in the manufacturing sectors are facing the most inevitable challenge to decide whether products to make through internal effort, or solicit from outside independent suppliers (buy) with a high degree of economies-of-scale to enhance efficiency and productivity (Espino-Rodríguez & Lai, 2014; Hilman & Mohamed, 2011; Lafontaine & Slade, 2007). Efficiency and productivity thru reducing costs, maintain high quality, flexibility, improved delivery dependability, and prompt quick response enable a manufacturing firm to achieve competitiveness and performance (Su & Gargeya, 2012). These perspectives assessment to decide <b>in-house</b> production (<b>Make)</b> by adapting the cost strategy or source externally (buy) by adapting differentiation. There are fewer studies to understand the long-term benefits of outsourcing to the firms (Hunter & Hall, 2011; Premuroso, 2008). Previous researches have conceptualized sourcing strategy and its effects on organizational performance, in which some of them emphasize on make or buy of sourcing (Espino-Rodríguez et al., 2014; Hilman & Mohamed, 2011; Lamminmaki, 2011). Extent literature considered sourcing as an evident governance modes or forms but little attention has been given to the underlying quality of relationship of sourcing firms which might influence performance. Extent literature to date about the relationship quality focused mainly on western culture and stable business environment and yet little know about the manufacturer‘s relationships with its key suppliers in emerging economies (Yang, Yu, Liu, & Rui, 2015). Thus this study aims to provide an integrated model of competitive strategy, sourcing strategy, sourcing relationship quality and firm performance.

40|$|MBA 2013 ABSTRACT Globally, the {{practice}} of multisourcing is continuing to grow. Many companies are optimising the way research and development is staffed internally, outsourced, or carried out offshore. This research was undertaken to determine the factors that drive and influence multisourcing in South African technology companies. The literature was reviewed to determine the factors that drive and influence multisourcing at research and development companies globally. The South African information technology and electronics industries were reviewed {{to determine the extent}} of multisourcing in technology companies in South Africa. As literature on South African multisourcing is scarce, this research and the findings add more light on this subject. An in-depth, qualitative interview method was used to gather data on the factors that influence multisourcing. Senior executives from various information technology and electronics companies were interviewed on their company's multisourcing practices. The findings of this research are that most technology companies in South Africa operate within niche markets and view their research and development expertise as their core competency. These companies primarily employ skilled staff to carry out research and development functions. Many of these companies outsource some research and development locally. Larger companies that consist of geographically dispersed offices choreograph their research and development across their branches. Some companies prefer importing certain products developed overseas than developing these products <b>in-house,</b> if this <b>makes</b> business sense. Factors such as costs, risks, scalability and technology influence multisourcing decisions. These findings may be of value to companies wishing to optimise their multisourcing practices...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "According to some Department of Defense (DOD) and industry experts, consolidation of the defense industry along with a shift in prime-contractor business models has resulted in prime contractors subcontracting more work on the production of weapon systems and concentrating instead on systems integration. Based on some estimates, 60 to 70 percent of work on defense contracts is now done by subcontractors, with certain industries aiming to outsource up to 80 percent of the work. At the same time, {{there is evidence that}} subcontractor performance may contribute to cost and schedule delays on weapon system programs. Congress has raised questions {{about the extent to which}} primes are awarding subcontracts competitively and about the government's insight into the process prime contractors use for determining what work to <b>make</b> <b>in-house</b> and what work should be bought from subcontractors (make-or-buy decisions). In the 2009 Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA), Congress directed DOD, as part of efforts to improve competition throughout the life cycle of major defense programs, to ensure that contractors' make-or-buy decisions are fair and objective. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense was directed to require prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems and components of major weapon systems. These actions were to be taken by November 22, 2009. Congress also directed DOD to revise its acquisition regulation regarding organizational conflicts of interest (OCI). In response to both of these requirements, DOD has drafted revisions to its acquisition regulation that are pending final approval. The 2010 National Defense Authorization Act required us to study the structure and management of major subcontracts under contracts for the acquisition of selected major weapon systems. In response to this mandate and given the reliance on subcontracts and the possible implications for government oversight, we (1) examined how government and prime contractors defined "major" subcontract, and the number and value of those considered major, (2) analyzed prime contractors' approach to selecting and managing major subcontractors, (3) examined the extent to which the government has visibility into major subcontracts and, finally, (4) examined how potential OCIs are addressed and the government's role in selecting the approach chosen. ...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Investigations of instabilities of a {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of}} a single spherical particle freely moving under the action of gravity in a Newtonian quiescent fluid are carried out by a direct numerical simulation method. To do this, the direct numerical simulation code, developed by Diaz-Goano et al. (2003), Veeramani et al. (2007) and Reddy et al. (2010) for Reynolds number (Re) under 210, has been modified to enable simulation Reynolds numbers up to 1800 and solid particle fluid density ratio in the range 0. 08 - 4. Following its successful modification, the code was applied to identify successive transitions in particle trajectory and surrounding fluid vortex pattern. The simulation results were then used to explore the hydrodynamic origin of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of the particle which were then related to the relevant vortex dynamics theory. With increase of Reynolds number, regimes of particle trajectory are identified as, (I) straight vertical, (II) straight oblique, (III) wavy oblique, (IV) zigzagging, (V) helical, (VI) early stage of chaotic, (VII) chaotic. The corresponding flow features are axisymmetric wake, counter-rotating streamwise vortex pairs in the wake, vortex rings, and eventual breakdown of symmetry (axisymmetric and planar) leading to the chaotic regime. A map of frequency spectrum is developed in terms of Re for both light and heavy particle, which indicates the heavy particle oscillations in a way of two-frequency modes since Re> 250 and the light particle since Re> 320. The low branch corresponds to the large-scale vortex shedding, and the high branch {{is associated with the}} presence of the small-scale vortex structure emanating from the free shear layer. The hydrodynamic origin of the zigzagging motion of the particle is investigated based on insights gained from the numerical simulation. The flow field represented by the pressure distribution, streamline pattern, vorticity distribution and vortical structure are carefully inspected at the Reynolds number of 294 and density ratio of 0. 5, where the particle presents a planar zigzagging motion. The vortex system is decomposed into bound vortex and streamwise vortex. The bound vortex leads to a positive transverse force, while the streamwise vortex leads to a reduction of the transverse force. The contributions of the present Ph. D. study can be highlighted by the following points: (1) improvement of the previous DNS <b>in-house</b> code to <b>make</b> it adapted to simulations with high Reynolds number; (2) systematic identification of the scenario of transition to chaos; (3) establishment of the corresponding relationship between the particle oscillating trajection and the vortex pattern; (4) quantitatively discovery of the hydrodynamic origin of the vortex induced vibration (VIV) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{popularity of}} the Internet has made the promise of worldwide electronic commerce (EC) a reality. Companies are exploring how to provide goods and services over the Internet in order to extend their reach to a global marketplace that conducts business 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The low cost of transacting business electronically has been the motivating factor as consumers eagerly look toward the Internet to create economic opportunities. Electronic payment, a financial exchange that takes place online between buyers and sellers, {{is an integral part}} of EC. The content of this exchange usually involves some form of digital financial instrument (such as encrypted credit card numbers, electronic checks, or digital cash) that is backed by a bank or an intermediary, or by legal tender. With the rapid growth in EC, organizations are often faced with the problem of selecting an appropriate electronic payment system (EPS) to meet their requirements. While demand is rapidly growing, security concern is a major reason that impedes EC growth. Organizations selecting individual EPS with different security methods find it extremely difficult to do business with each other. Selection of an EPS is a complex task. Firms often lack the necessary <b>in-house</b> expertise to <b>make</b> this choice. Hiring external consultants with expertise in the area can be expensive. A poor decision may have a significant negative impact. Implementing an EPS requires considerable technical expertise. Difficulties involved in selection and implementation include identifying the firm’s requirements, understanding available EPS options, and evaluating the best option based on economic, technical, and operational concerns. To deal with the complex decision of EPS selection in a changing environment, an expert system may be used. An expert system prototype for the selection of EPS was proposed, based on analysis and evaluation of major electronic payment systems (EPSs). The goal of this dissertation was to develop a rule-based expert system that would aid the requirement analysis process by asking appropriate questions; maintain a knowledge base on the security characteristics of various EPSs; and contain the expertise required to select and implement an appropriate system that meets an organization 2 ̆ 7 s security requirements. An extensive literature review was conducted to evaluate major EPSs to ascertain each system 2 ̆ 7 s applicability, strengths and weaknesses. Features of each were analyzed, with an emphasis on security aspects. Results were used to help design and build a prototype rule-based system to help organizations determine an appropriate strategy for security in EPS. The following EPSs were considered: Electronic card-based systems: First Virtual (FV), Cyber Cash, and Secure Electronic Transactions (SET). Electronic checks: Net Bill and NetCheque. Electronic cash payment systems: Ecash and CyberCoin. Micropayment systems: Millicent and Pay word. The decision table approach was utilized to ensure that the rule base was well designed. The proposed system is capable of providing security advice related to those EPSs that have been included in the system. The proposed system handles questions based on security characteristics, but is not able to handle new systems whose characteristics have not been entered into the system. The expert system was designed in such a way that future changes to EPS characteristics require minimum change to the knowledge base. A prototype expert system for the selection of electronic payment systems was built and tested to validate the system. The recommendations of the expert system were compared to the recommendations of experts. Test results indicated that the rule-based paradigm with decision tables is useful in the design of a successful expert system for the selection of EPSs...|$|R
