There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent <b>in</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the amount}} of time {{adolescents}} spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors.

Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E

500|$|Legal battles {{concerning}} {{the separation of}} church and state originated in laws dating to 1938 which required religious instruction <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> <b>or</b> provided state funding for religious schools. The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents (the [...] "separationists") were the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the American Jewish Congress. The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 Everson v. Board of Education case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote [...] "he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state…. That wall must be kept high and impregnable." [...] It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a [...] "national school board", and that the Constitution did not govern social issues. However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional. Historian Samuel Walker writes that the ACLU's [...] "greatest impact on American life" [...] was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to [...] "constitutionalize" [...] so many public controversies.|$|E
