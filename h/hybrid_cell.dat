40|$|Somatic <b>cell</b> <b>hybrids</b> were {{generated}} by fusion of mouse erythroleukemia cells either to mouse L cells (B 82), human fibroblasts (W 1 - 18 VA 2), or human marrow fractions enriched in erythroblasts. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> were examined for globin gene expression by benzidine staining to detect cytoplasmic hemoglobin, and by molecular hybridization of cellular RNA to globin complementary DNA (cDNA) to detect globin messenger RNA (MRNA). The fibroblast (human or mouse) times erythroleukemia <b>cell</b> <b>hybrids</b> grown in monolayer retained {{most of the}} chromosomes of each parent. Neither cytoplasmic hemoglobin nor globin mRNA was detected in dimethylsulfoxide-treated fibroblast times erythroleukemia <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating extinction of hemoglobin synthesis prior {{to the formation of}} cytoplasmic mRNA. The human marrow times mouse erythroleukemia <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> grown in suspension culture contained only a few human chromosomes and exhibited low levels of hemoglobin synthesis which were amplified by 2 % dimethylsulfoxide. Mouse (but not human) globin mRNA was demonstrated in these <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells.</b> The results suggest that somatic <b>cell</b> <b>hybrids</b> may be useful in searching for genetic factors which regulate activity of the globin genes...|$|R
40|$|The {{replication}} of mouse-tropic and xenotropic strains of {{murine leukemia virus}} in human × mouse <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> was investigated. NB-tropic strains of the leukemia virus replicated efficiently in several hybrid lines, including those that contained a complete complement of human chromosomes and many mouse chromosomes. In lines {{with only a few}} mouse chromosomes, NB-tropic viruses failed to replicate. N- and B-tropic viruses replicated in human × N-type and human × B-type cells, respectively. The N- and B-tropic viruses replicating in these <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> retained their original tropism. The viral restrictive functions of the mouse Fv- 1 locus were expressed in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells,</b> restricting the {{replication of}} N- and B-tropic strains in human × B-type and human × N-type mouse cells, respectively. In contrast to mouse-tropic viruses, AT- 124 virus, a xenotropic strain, replicated in human but not in mouse <b>cells</b> or in <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> containing a complete complement of human chromosomes and near complete complement of mouse chromosomes However, hybrid lines with only a few mouse chromosomes supported AT- 124 replication. Thus, human genes in <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> do not restrict the replication of mouse or xenotropic murine leukemia virus strains, while mouse genes in such cells restrict xenotropic leukemia virus replication and, as determined by the mouse Fv- 1 phenotype, mouse-tropic murine leukemia virus. These results indicate that exogenously applied mouse-tropic and xenotropic oncornaviruses exhibit different patterns of restriction in human-mouse <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> and that such <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> may be used for genetic analysis of oncornavirus replication...|$|R

40|$|Syrian hamster embryo cells {{transformed}} by adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) or simian virus 40 (SV 40) differ markedly in morphology, tumorigenicity, and susceptibility to in vitro lysis by nonspecific cytotoxic <b>cells.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> formed by fusing Ad 2 - and SV 40 -transformed Syrian hamster embryo cells may express only SV 40 T antigens or both SV 40 and Ad 2 T antigens. Hybrids that express only SV 40 T antigens are {{indistinguishable from the}} nonhybrid SV 40 -transformed phenotype, whereas <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> that express T antigens from both viruses closely resemble the nonhybrid parental Ad 2 -transformed phenotype. Because these <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> have been useful {{in the study of}} neoplastic transformation, we determined the amount of viral antigens that they accumulate in an attempt to correlate the level of expression of the transforming viral genes with some of their phenotypic properties. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> that expressed proteins from both viruses showed reduced levels of SV 40 T antigens compared with those of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> that did not express Ad 2 T antigens. We also found that the production of several cellular proteins that influence cytomorphology was inhibited in <b>hybrid</b> and nonhybrid <b>cells</b> that expressed Ad 2 T antigens, and the repression of these cellular proteins correlated with a change in cytomorphology from fibroblastic to spherical. Finally, we showed that the susceptibility of our <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> to in vitro lysis by natural killer cells and activated macrophages, two putative host-effector cells involved in defense against neoplasia, correlated closely with the level of expression of a 58, 000 -dalton Ad 2 protein. The results reported here, together with the results of previous studies, indicate that the oncogenic potential of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> that express both Ad 2 and SV 40 antigens is extremely sensitive to Ad 2 expression, whereas other phenotypic properties depend on Ad 2 expression in a dose-dependent manner...|$|R

The morphological data we obtained using light and electron microscopy revealed a correlation between the karyotype constitution of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> and their differentiation during the formation of embryoid bodies. At the beginning of development, the embryoid bodies derived from <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> already showed an advanced degree of differentiation.

Further, it has been shown that <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> which have lost T-antigen are capable of synthesizing this antigen upon infection with SV 40, thereby demonstrating that loss of the viral antigen from the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> is not due to loss of some cellular gene required for the expression of the viral genome. Results of karyological analyses of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> argue against the existence of a single specific integration site for the SV 40 genome in human cells...|$|R

40|$|Somatic hybrids of ASL- 1 leukaemia {{cells and}} LM(TK-) {{fibroblast}} cells, established mouse cell lines, are rejected by immunocompetent histocompatible mice; however, they grow progressively in nude mice and proliferate indefinitely in vitro. Mice rejecting such <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit immunity toward ASL- 1 leukaemia cells, used {{as one of}} the parents in forming the hybrid. In histocompatible recipients, ASL- 1 cells are highly malignant, but LM(TK-) cells are rejected. Several distinguishing characteristics in the properties of the surface antigens of the three cell types are described. ASL- 1 <b>cells</b> and <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> but not LM(TK-) cells form an antigenically cross-reactive leukaemia-associated antigen; however, it is not detected on the surface membranes of ASL- 1 cells taken directly from leukaemic mice. The antigen becomes apparent after short-term culture of the cells. Serum from leukaemic animals, unlike specific antibodies, has no effect upon the expression of the leukaemia-associated antigen of either hybrid or ASL- 1 <b>cells.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> form a 'second' antigen, foreign to F 1 mice, which can be distinguished from the leukaemia-associated antigen of ASL- 1 cells. It is not detected on either parental cell. The leukaemia-associated antigen of ASL- 1 cells is more readily digested by each of three proteases used than the analogous antigen of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells.</b> The heightened immunogenic properties of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> is reflected by the observation that spleen cells from mice injected with <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> undergo extensive proliferation in short-term in vitro culture, with or without an added specific stimulus...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the proposed role of human chromosome 21 {{in determining the}} cellular sensitivity to human alpha, beta, and gamma interferons (HuIFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma) and {{the expression of the}} receptors for the HuIFNs with the use of mouse-human <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> containing human chromosome 21. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> (WA 17) containing three copies of human chromosome 21 showed specific displaceable binding of 125 I-labeled HuIFN-alpha 2 (125 I-HuIFN-alpha 2), which was not observed with mouse parent (A 9) cells. Crosslinking of 125 I-HuIFN-alpha 2 bound to WA 17 cells with disuccinimidyl suberate yielded a complex of Mr approximately equal to 150, 000 similar to the 125 I-HuIFN-alpha 2 -receptor complex obtained with human cells as described earlier. Such a complex was not obtained with mouse parent (A 9) <b>cells</b> or with <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> containing certain other human chromosomes but not chromosome 21. Mice inoculated with mouse-human <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> containing human chromosome 21 produce antibodies that block the antiviral action of HuIFN-alpha and -beta on human cells. Such antibodies could immunoprecipitate the 125 I-HuIFN-alpha 2 -receptor complex obtained from human cells but not free 125 I-HuIFN-alpha 2, indicating that these antibodies were directed against the receptor. WA 17 <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> were highly sensitive to the antiviral action of HuIFN-alpha 2, -alpha (Le) and -beta but were completely insensitive to HuIFN-gamma. Furthermore, 125 I-HuIFN-gamma showed specific binding to human WISH cells but not to WA 17 <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> or A 9 mouse cells. The results indicate that the receptors for HuIFN-alpha and -beta but not for HuIFN-gamma are specified by human chromosome 21. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> containing one, two, or three copies of human chromosome 21 were found to be increasingly sensitive to HuIFN-alpha 2, indicating that a chromosome 21 -specified component (possibly the HuIFN-alpha receptor) may be a limiting factor in the cellular sensitivity to HuIFN-alpha...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{different}} kinds of malignant cell were fused with certain derivatives of the L cell line and the ability of the resulting <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> to grow progressively in vivo was examined. In all cases the highly malignant character of the tumour cells was suppressed by fusion with the L cell derivatives, whether or not these had metabolic defects that facilitated selection of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells.</b> So long as the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> retained the complete chromosome complements of the two parent cells, their ability to grow progressively in vivo was very limited, for tumours composed of such unreduced hybrids were not found. However, when they lost certain specific, but as yet unidentified, chromosomes, the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> regained the ability to grow progressively in vivo and gave rise to a tumour. These findings thus indicated that the L cell derivatives contributed something to the hybrid that suppressed the malignancy of the tumour cell, and that this contribution was lost when certain specific chromosomes were eliminated...|$|R

40|$|The Oct- 3 gene is {{expressed}} in highly undifferentiated cells and is implicated in mammalian early embryogenesis.

Expression of Oct- 3 was extinguished {{at the transcriptional level}} in all the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> examined. The Oct- 3 modulating activity required for the Oct- 3 -mediated enhancer activation was also extinguished. When the Oct- 3 transactivating function was introduced into the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells,</b> they transformed into morphologically distinct nestin-/Brn- 2 - cells ('revertants'). When the 'revertant' cells subsequently lost Oct- 3 expression, they differentiated back to nestin+/Brn- 2 + cells. The close correlation between the phenotypic changes and the gain/loss of Oct- 3 function indicates that Oct- 3 can induce dedifferentiation of the neural cells...|$|R

WE HAVE previously shown the in-teresting occurrence of anti-tumour im-munization with somatic <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> (Favre, Carcassonne and Meyer, 1974 a).

40|$|The {{inability}} of mouse <b>cell</b> <b>hybrids</b> derived from two malignant parental cells to produce tumors in syngeneic F 1 hosts was analyzed. YC hybrids, {{derived from the}} fusion of C 1. 1 D and L 1210 clls, failed to induce any tumor in adult mice, while 91 % of x-irradiated newborn mice developed tumors and died. Some telocentric chromosomes were lacking in hybrid tumors; however, none of the immunologically intact adult mice developed tumors when grafted with tumors grown in x-irradiated newborn mice. This indicates that histocompatibility factors interfered in the failure of YC tumors to grow to adult hosts. Syngeneic F 1 mice immunized with Y 2 C <b>hybrid</b> <b>cells</b> had cytotoxic antibodies against Y 2 C hybrids and C 1. 1 D and L 1210 parental cells.

This approach included the use of two separate λ vectors for library construction, and a partial filling-in reaction that removes {{the need for a}} selectable marker. This filling-in reaction worked by destroying the specific cohesive ends (resulting from restriction digests) of the DNA fragments that were nonligated and noncircularized, thus preventing them from cloning into the vectors, in a more energy-efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, this improved technique required less DNA to start with, and also produced a library that could be transferred into a plasmid form, making it easier to store and replicate. Using this new approach, they successfully constructed a human NotI jumping library from a lymphoblastoid cell line and a human chromosome 3-specific NotI jumping library from a human chromosome 3 and mouse <b>hybrid</b> <b>cell</b> line.|$|E
50|$|A {{cytoplasmic hybrid}} (or cybrid, a {{portmanteau}} {{of the two}} words) is a eukaryotic cell line produced by the fusion of a whole cell with a cytoplast. Cytoplasts are enucleated cells.

A special case of cybrid formation {{involves the use of}} rho-zero cells as the whole cell partner in the fusion. Rho-zero cells are cells which have been depleted of their own mitochondrial DNA by prolonged incubation with ethidium bromide, a chemical which inhibits mitochondrial DNA replication.
