5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|In the French sources, one {{important}} <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> {{centered on the}} question of whether the Natchez planned a simultaneous attack on the French with the other major tribes of the region. French colonial governor Étienne Périer, in a report to superiors in France written one week after the revolt, claimed that many of the Indian nations in the lower Mississippi Valley had plotted with the Natchez to attack the French on the same day and that even the Choctaw, who had been close allies of the French, were part of the plot. Périer then cancelled a meeting with the Choctaw planned for the first two days of December in New Orleans, contending that it was to be the occasion for an attack. Périer in this way defended his actions as governor by insinuating that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action. However, historians Gordon Sayre and Arnaud Balvay have pointed out that Jean-Baptiste Delaye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in a 1730 unpublished narrative that Périer's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack. Another document in French, of anonymous authorship, asserted that the Natchez revolt was a British plan to destroy a new French tobacco business in Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> been about building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

25|$|Within feminist {{circles the}} <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> been split roughly into two camps: some who see BDSM as an aspect or {{reflection}} of oppression (for example, Alice Schwarzer) and, {{on the other}} side, pro-BDSM feminists, often grouped {{under the banner of}} sex-positive feminism (see Samois); both of them {{can be traced back to}} the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Extensive <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> {{taken place}} {{on ways to}} make {{open-source}} hardware as accessible as open-source software.

Another option is to design products so they are easy to replicate, as exemplified in the concept of open-source appropriate technology.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, 2005, the Head of the Earth Orientation Center of the IERS sent {{a notice}} to IERS Bulletins C and D subscribers, soliciting {{comments}} on a U.S. proposal before the ITU-R Study Group 7's WP7-A to eliminate leap seconds from the UTC broadcast standard before 2008 (the ITU-R {{is responsible for}} the definition of UTC). It was expected to be considered in November 2005, but the <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> since been postponed. Under the proposal, leap seconds would be technically replaced by leap hours as an attempt to satisfy the legal requirements of several ITU-R member nations that civil time be astronomically tied to the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E

25|$|The Alaska State Capitol in {{downtown}} Juneau was originally built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, {{the federal courthouse}} and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains {{the home of the}} state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. Recent <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> been focused between relocating the seat of state government outside of Juneau and building a new capitol building in Juneau; neither position has led efforts to keep the capital in Juneau.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of Newton and Hooke, {{scholarly}} <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> also touched {{on the question of}} whether Hooke's 1679 mention of 'compounding the motions' provided Newton with something new and valuable, even though that was not a claim actually voiced by Hooke at the time. As described above, Newton's manuscripts of the 1660s do show him actually combining tangential motion with the effects of radially directed force or endeavour, for example in his derivation of the inverse square relation for the circular case. They also show Newton clearly expressing the concept of linear inertia—for which he was indebted to Descartes' work, published in 1644 (as Hooke probably was). These matters do not appear to have been learned by Newton from Hooke.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> {{occurred}} {{as to the}} level of Bryant's mental health. It is generally accepted that he has a subnormal IQ (estimated at 66, and in the lowest 2% of his age group) and {{at the time of the}} offences was in receipt of a Disability Support Pension on the basis of being mentally handicapped. Reports that he had schizophrenia were based on his mother's misinterpretation of psychiatric advice; Bryant had never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, nor any major depressive disorder. Media reports also detailed his odd behaviour as a child. However, he was able to drive a car and obtain a gun, despite lacking a gun licence or a driver's licence. This was a matter which, in the public debate that followed, was widely regarded as a telling demonstration of the inadequacy of the nation's gun laws.|$|E

500|$|Much <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> {{concerned}} the film's treatment {{of environmental protection}} and the parallels to, for example, the destruction of rainforests, mountaintop removal for mining and evictions from homes for development. [...] The title of the film and various visual and story elements provoked discussion of the film's use of the iconography of Hinduism, which Cameron confirmed had inspired him. [...] Christians, including the Vatican, worried that the film promotes pantheism over Christian beliefs, while others instead thought that it sympathetically explores biblical concepts. Other critics either praised the film's spiritual elements or found them hackneyed.|$|E
500|$|While {{some critics}} have tended to view the film as {{perfectly}} straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as [...] "the stuff of torpid platitudes," [...] online <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> been much more positive. Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making {{the case that the}} film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams. Other critics read Inception as Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism. Yet other critics, such as Kristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlighting Inception as a new form of narrative that revels in [...] "continuous exposition".|$|E
500|$|The 1755 Cape Ann {{earthquake}} {{took place}} {{off the coast}} of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay (present-day Massachusetts) on November 18. At between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, it remains the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts. No one was killed, but it damaged hundreds of buildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina. Sailors on a ship more than [...] offshore felt the quake, and mistook it at first for their ship running aground. Many residents of Boston and the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God, and it occasioned a brief increase in religious fervor in the city. Modern studies estimate that if a similar quake shook Boston today, it would result in as much as $5 billion in damage and hundreds of deaths. Some <b>discussion</b> <b>has</b> revolved around the idea that this may have been a remotely triggered event.|$|E
