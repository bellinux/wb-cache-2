A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's <b>death</b> <b>is</b> postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.|$|E
