5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Attempting to {{list the}} {{equipment}} available to the DRC's land forces is difficult; most figures are unreliable estimates based on known items delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>The</b> IISS's Military Balance 2007 and Orbat.com's Concise World Armies 2005 give only slightly differing figures however (the figures below are from the IISS Military Balance 2007). Much of the Army's equipment is non-operational due to insufficient maintenance—in 2002 only 20 percent of the Army's armoured vehicles were estimated as being serviceable.|$|E

Since retiring, he has ventured into club management as well as becoming a television football pundit.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, the Zarqa River {{is about}} 30 million years old. At the river's origin is 'Ain Ghazal, a major archaeological site {{that dates back}} to the Neolithic.

A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007).|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides {{as a whole}} were {{a strong}} Scottish Gaelic-speaking area, and in 1921 more than 50% of the populations of most of these islands, {{including}} Skye, Mull and Islay, were proficient in the language. However, although the Outer Hebrides have retained many Gaelic speakers, in the 2001 census only Skye (31%) and Tiree (48%) had more than 25% of the resident population able to speak Gaelic; Mull, Jura, Gigha and Coll each recorded figures of less than 15%.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>the</b> Kathiawari was {{considered}} a good cavalry mount.

Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari is well suited. In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.|$|E

They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
