40|$|The CMS {{experiment}} at the LHC {{has established}} an infrastructure using the <b>FroNTier</b> framework to deliver conditions (i. e. calibration, alignment, etc.) data to processing clients worldwide. <b>FroNTier</b> {{is a simple}} web service approach providing client HTTP access to a central database service. The system for CMS has been developed to work with POOL which provides object relational mapping between the C++ clients and various database technologies. Because of the read only nature of the data, Squid proxy caching servers are maintained near clients and these caches provide high performance data access. Several features {{have been developed to}} make the system meet the needs of CMS including careful attention to cache coherency with the central database, and low latency loading required for the operation of the online High Level Trigger. The ease of deployment, stability of operation, and high performance make the <b>FroNTier</b> approach well suited to the GRID environment being used for CMS offline, {{as well as for the}} online environment used by the CMS High Level Trigger (HLT). The use of standard software, such as Squid and various monitoring tools, make the system reliable, highly configurable and easily maintained.

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{approach for}} simulation of large deformation solid dynamics is to combine Eulerian finite differencing with material interface tracking. The Eulerian computational mesh {{is not subject}} to mesh distortion, and tracking eliminates spurious numerical diffusion at interfaces and the need for mixed-material computational cells. We have developed such an approach {{within the framework of the}} front tracking method, as implemented in the <b>FronTier</b> code. Our two-dimensional solid dynamics module is based on a fully conservative formulation of the governing equations for large-strain deformation, a hyperelastic equation of state that allows for large volume change, and a rate-dependent plasticity model. It features conservative finite differencing, use of a Riemann solver to enforce the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions at material interfaces, and an implicit method for integrating the plastic source terms. This paper presents an overview of solid dynamics in <b>FronTier</b> and some preliminary applications to high-velocity expanding ring and shock-accelerated interface problems. 1...|$|R

On the component service, we have designed and implemented a robust functionality for the Lagrangian tracking of dynamic interface.

He convinced Kreis {{to allow him to}} take some [...] "warm up" [...] laps, and he clocked quicker times than Kreis (120.919 mph {194.59 km/h}).

He also had mechanical problems on his second attempt. He slowed down on his third and final attempt, and qualified 20th overall with a speed of 95.780 mph (154.113 km/h). On race day, he moved from 20th to fifth by Lap 5, having had passed 14 cars on that lap alone. He moved up to second on Lap 16.

40|$|The direct {{numerical}} simulation (DNS) method {{has been used to}} the study of the linear and shock wave propagation in bubbly fluids and the estimation of the efficiency of the cavitation mitigation in the container of the Spallation Neutron Source liquid mercury target. The DNS method for bubbly flows is based on the front tracking technique developed for free surface flows. Our front tracking hydrodynamic simulation code <b>FronTier</b> is capable of tracking and resolving topological changes of a large number of interfaces in two- and three-dimensional spaces. Both the bubbles and the fluid are compressible. In the application to the cavitation mitigation by bubble injection in the SNS, the collapse pressure of cavitation bubbles was calculated by solving the Keller equation with the liquid pressure obtained from the DNS of the bubbly flows. Simulations of the propagation of linear and shock waves in bubbly fluids have been performed, and a good agreement with theoretical predictions and experiments has been achieved. The validated DNS method for bubbly flows has been applied to the cavitation mitigation estimation in the SNS. The pressure wave propagation in the pure and the bubbly mercury has been simulated, and the collapse pressure of cavitation bubbles has been calculated. The efficiency of the cavitation mitigation by bubble injection has been estimated. The DNS method for bubbly flows has been validated through comparison of simulations with theory and experiments.
