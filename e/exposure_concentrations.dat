Prior epidemiological and exposure assessment studies used outdoor NO 2 concentrations as a surrogate for individual TRAP exposures and generally did not explicitly account for in-vehicle exposures. In this study, we assessed the contribution of the in-vehicle microenvironment to an individual's ambient source-derived NO 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> in a subset of MESA Air participants residing in Winston-Salem, NC (n= 46). We measured time-integrated microenvironmental (residential indoor, residential outdoor, and in-vehicle) and personal NO 2 concentrations as surrogates of TRAP during a winter sampling campaign; time-location data was collected through a time-location diary. For our primary aim, we calculated microenvironmental contributions to each individual's ambient source-derived NO 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> using a time-weighted model. Secondarily, we evaluated the correlations between microenvironmental NO 2 concentrations and the ambient source-derived individual NO 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> using Pearson correlation coefficients. Finally, we attempted to predict in-vehicle NO 2 masses using the time spent in different travel conditions using multiple linear regression in a person-level analysis, whose model was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Data for analysis was available on 38 participants, who spent an average of one hour per day in-vehicle. The in-vehicle microenvironment was a major contributor to each individual's ambient source-derived NO 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration,</b> accounting for an estimated 48. 9 ± 10. 4 %. Indoor ambient source-derived and outdoor NO 2 concentrations showed stronger correlations (r= 0. 73) with each individual's ambient source-derived NO 2 <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> than in-vehicle NO 2 concentrations (r= 0. 44). The time spent in different travel conditions explained 44 % of the in-sample variation within in-vehicle NO 2 masses with a RMSE of 0. 25 ppb, and demonstrated good predictive value when tested out of sample (CV R 2 = 0. 42; CV RMSE= 0. 15 ppb); the number of trips driven during the two-week sampling period was the most important predictor of in-vehicle NO 2 masses (partial R 2 = 0. 33).

The {{main objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a risk assessment based on exposure data collected from pharmaceutical research scientists and veterinarians in San Diego, CA who are occupationally exposed to isoflurane gas. To achieve the objective, it was necessary to determine the dose-response relationship from literature values on the toxicology of isoflurane, and then through an exposure assessment, perform a risk assessment. Currently, occupational exposure to anesthetic gases occurs in the health sector, such as hospital operating rooms, veterinary clinics, and pharmaceutical research laboratories. According to California OSHA 5155 Table AC- 1 Permissible Exposure Limits for Chemical Contaminants, the employer shall assure that no employee is exposed to an 8 -hour time-weighted average (TWA) concentration of airborne isoflurane in excess of 2 parts per million parts of air. Between January 2006 and January 2013 isoflurane exposure data was collected from pharmaceutical research and veterinary facilities located in San Diego, CA. Isoflurane samples were analyzed by modified OSHA Method 07. The results show that the mean time weighted average concentration of isoflurane gas exposure in a pharmaceutical research laboratory was 0. 62 ppm. The maximum recorded <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> from the data pool was 1. 64 ppm. The mean time weighted average concentration of isoflurane gas exposure for the veterinary clinics was 2. 14 ppm. The maximum recorded <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> from the veterinary data pool was 2. 77 ppm. The hazard index (HI) is defined as the ratio of the <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> over the reference dose. The hazard index, calculated from the average daily dose (mean TWA of 1. 33 mg/kg-day), of the pharmaceutical research population was 0. 06. The hazard index for this population's maximum recorded <b>exposure</b> <b>concentration</b> was 0. 16. The hazard index of the veterinary population (average daily dose mean TWA of 0. 21 mg/kg-day) was 0. 21.

If the HI is less than 1, then the health effects are assumed not to be of concern, however, if the hazard quotient is greater than 1, then health effects may be assumed to occur.
