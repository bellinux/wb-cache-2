5|$|Although it did {{not sell}} enough copies to reach the {{mainstream}} music charts, the album was well received with positive reviews and recognition. Thornton's lyrics and Nakamura's production were highly praised, as was DJ Qbert's innovative scratching. Dr. Octagonecologyst has since been ranked {{as one of the}} best hip hop albums of the 1990s. The character of Dr. Octagon has appeared in multiple works by Thornton, including <b>First</b> <b>Come,</b> First Served (1999) and Dr. Dooom 2 (2008), both of which contain tracks in which Octagon is murdered by Dr. Dooom.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Thornton {{introduced}} {{the character of}} Dr. Dooom on the album <b>First</b> <b>Come,</b> First Served (1999). The album featured a track in which the character murdered Dr. Octagon. In 2002, Thornton announced The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon, a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. The resulting album, The Return of Dr. Octagon released in 2006, was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, based upon three completed vocal tracks and reconstructed outtakes. Thornton later produced Dr. Dooom 2 in response to The Return of Dr. Octagon.|$|E

5|$|Nigel Kneale was a Manx {{television}} playwright who had <b>first</b> <b>come</b> {{to prominence}} in the 1950s thanks to his three Quatermass serials and his controversial adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, {{all of which were}} produced by the BBC. Going freelance in the nineteen-sixties, Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing such plays as The Year of the Sex Olympics, Wine of India and, for the anthology series Out of the Unknown, The Chopper.|$|E

5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, <b>first</b> <b>come</b> into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that the idea of}} annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry's father Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine of Aragon had <b>first</b> <b>come</b> to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II on the grounds that Catherine was still a virgin.|$|E

5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{receives}} {{over one}} million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at Redfish Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA. Most of the campgrounds are on a <b>first</b> <b>come</b> first served basis, while some can be reserved.|$|E
5|$|The 12th and 13th centuries saw a huge {{development}} of the English economy. This was partially driven by {{the growth in the}} population from around 1.5million {{at the time of the}} creation of the Domesday Book in 1086 to between 4and 5million in 1300. England remained a primarily agricultural economy, with the rights of major landowners and the duties of serfs increasingly enshrined in English law. More land, much of it at the expense of the royal forests, was brought into production to feed the growing population or to produce wool for export to Europe. Many hundreds of new towns, some of them planned, sprung up across England, supporting the creation of guilds, charter fairs and other important medieval institutions. The descendants of the Jewish financiers who had <b>first</b> <b>come</b> to England with William the Conqueror played a significant role in the growing economy, along with the new Cistercian and Augustinian religious orders that came to become major players in the wool trade of the north. Mining increased in England, with the silver boom of the 12th century helping to fuel a fast-expanding currency.|$|E
5|$|The Breves causae and Argumenta {{belong to}} a pre-Vulgate {{tradition}} of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations {{and would have been}} difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: <b>first</b> <b>come</b> the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear {{at the very end of}} the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having <b>first</b> <b>come</b> to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
