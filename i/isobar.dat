5|$|There are {{a variety}} of metrics {{commonly}} used to measure storm size. The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed <b>isobar</b> (ROCI), and the radius of vanishing wind. An additional metric is the radius at which the cyclone's relative vorticity field decreases to 1×10−5 s−1.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of neptunium {{range in}} atomic weight from 225.0339 u (225Np) to 244.068 u (244Np). Most of the isotopes that are {{lighter than the}} most stable one, 237Np, decay primarily by electron capture although a sizable number, most notably 229Np and 230Np, also exhibit various levels of decay via alpha emission to become protactinium. 237Np itself, being the beta-stable <b>isobar</b> of mass number 237, decays almost exclusively by alpha emission into 233Pa, with very rare (occurring only about once in trillions of decays) spontaneous fission and cluster decay (emission of 30Mg to form 207Tl). All of the known isotopes except one that are heavier than this decay exclusively via beta emission. The lone exception, 240mNp, exhibits a rare (>0.12%) decay by isomeric transition {{in addition to the}} beta emission. 237Np eventually decays to form bismuth-209 and thallium-205, unlike most other common heavy nuclei which decay into isotopes of lead. This decay chain is known as the neptunium series. This decay chain had long been extinct on Earth due to the short half-lives of all of its isotopes above bismuth-209, but is now being resurrected thanks to artificial production of neptunium on the tonne scale.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{that the}} cyclostrophic {{trajectory}} {{was found to}} be an <b>isobar.</b>|$|E
25|$|This slope applies {{equally well}} to the spacing of {{straight}} <b>isobars</b> (geostrophic flow) or of curved <b>isobars</b> (cyclostrophic and gradient flows).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Density {{lines and}} <b>isobars</b> cross in a {{baroclinic}} fluid (top). As density {{is related to}} temperature, on a surface map, <b>isobars</b> and isotherms cross too ...|$|R
5000|$|The speed {{cannot be}} {{determined}} by this balance.However, [...] entails that the trajectory must run along <b>isobars,</b> else the moving parcel would experience changes of pressure like in antitriptic flows.No bending is thus only possible if the <b>isobars</b> are straight lines in the first instance.So, geostrophic flows take {{the appearance of a}} stream channelled along such <b>isobars.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since this {{condition}} {{occurs when the}} n direction is that of an <b>isobar,</b> s is perpendicular to the isobars.|$|E
25|$|So, the cyclostrophic {{speed is}} {{determined}} by the magnitude of the pressure gradient across the trajectory and by the radius of curvature of the <b>isobar.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} double beta decay, two {{neutrons}} in the nucleus are converted to protons, and two electrons and two electron antineutrinos are emitted. The {{process can be}} thought as two simultaneous beta minus decays. In order for (double) beta decay to be possible, the final nucleus must have a larger binding energy than the original nucleus. For some nuclei, such as germanium-76, the <b>isobar</b> one atomic number higher (arsenic-76) has a smaller binding energy, preventing single beta decay. However, the <b>isobar</b> with atomic number two higher, selenium-76, has a larger binding energy, so double beta decay is allowed.|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} stresses within granular fills {{contained in}} trenches {{can be determined}} using Marston's theory or numerical modeling. Marston's theory gives only the average value of the vertical stress at a depth. Numerical modeling {{can be used for}} determining the vertical stress at any point within the fill. This paper presents vertical stress <b>isobars</b> for trenches filled with granular materials, developed from numerical modeling, and proposed in terms of dimensionless variables. These <b>isobars</b> are similar to the pressure <b>isobars</b> for uniformly loaded circular and strip footings found in literature. These <b>isobars</b> can be used for determining vertical stresses at any point within the granular material contained in trenches and can become a simple and valuable tool. The validity of the <b>isobars</b> was verified through several trenches with randomly selected dimensions and fill properties. It was found that the estimates using the <b>isobars</b> were within 9 % of the estimates from the numerical model...|$|R
50|$|<b>Isobars</b> are atoms (nuclides) of {{different}} chemical elements {{that have the}} same number of nucleons. Correspondingly, <b>isobars</b> differ in atomic number (or number of protons) but have the same mass number. An example of a series of <b>isobars</b> would be 40S, 40Cl, 40Ar, 40K, and 40Ca. The nuclei of these nuclides all contain 40 nucleons; however, they contain varying numbers of protons and neutrons.|$|R
25|$|In a {{barotropic}} atmosphere, where {{density is}} a function only of pressure, a horizontal pressure gradient will drive a geostrophic wind that is constant with height. However, if a horizontal temperature gradient exists along <b>isobars,</b> the <b>isobars</b> will be thicker. This causes {{the slope of the}} <b>isobars</b> to increase with height. This is illustrated in panel (b) of the figure to the left. Because <b>isobars</b> are steeper at higher elevations, the associated pressure gradient force is stronger there. However, the Coriolis force is the same, so the resulting geostrophic wind at higher elevations must be greater {{in the direction of the}} pressure force.|$|R
25|$|The {{expression}} of geostrophic speed {{resembles that of}} antitriptic speed: here the speed {{is determined by the}} magnitude of the pressure gradient across (instead of along) the trajectory that develops along (instead of across) an <b>isobar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pressure force. This is {{the action}} on the parcel arising from the spatial {{differences}} of atmospheric pressure p around it. (Temporal changes are of no interest here.) The spatial change of pressure is visualised through isobars, that are contours joining the locations where the pressure has a same value. In the figure this is simplistically shown by equally spaced straight lines. The pressure force acting on the parcel is minus the gradient vector of p (in symbols: grad p) - drawn in the figure as a blue arrow. At all points, the pressure gradient points to the direction of maximum increase of p and is always normal to the <b>isobar</b> at that point. Since the flow packet feels a push from the higher to the lower pressures, the effective pressure vector force {{is contrary to the}} pressure gradient, whence the minus sign before the gradient vector.|$|E
25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but gauge pressure can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure <b>isobar)</b> by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E
50|$|The basic {{principles}} of physics and the Coriolis effect satisfactorily explain that {{the direction of the}} wind in the atmosphere is parallel to the <b>isobars.</b> Measurements of wind speed and direction at heights well above ground level confirm that the speed of the wind matches that predicted by considerations of gradient flow, and the direction of the wind is indeed parallel to the <b>isobars</b> in the region. However, from ground level up to heights where the influence of the earth’s surface can be neglected, the wind speed is less than predicted by the barometric pressure gradient, and the wind direction is partly across the <b>isobars</b> rather than parallel to them. This flow of air across the <b>isobars</b> near ground level is a secondary flow. It does not conform to the primary flow, which is parallel to the <b>isobars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Isobars</b> are nuclides {{with the}} same number of nucleons, i.e. mass number, but {{different}} numbers of protons and different number of neutrons. <b>Isobars</b> neighbor each other diagonally from lower-left to upper-right. Example: carbon-14, nitrogen-14, oxygen-14 in the sample table above.|$|R
50|$|No observationally stable <b>isobars</b> {{exist for}} mass numbers 5 (decays to helium-4 plus a proton or neutron), 8 (decays to two helium-4 nuclei), 147, 151, {{as well as}} for 209 and above. Two observationally stable <b>isobars</b> exist for 36, 40, 46, 50, 54, 58, 64, 70, 74, 80, 84, 86, 92, 94, 96, 98, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 120, 122, 123, 126, 132, 134, 136, 138, 142, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 168, 170, 176, 180, 184, 192, 196, 198 and 204. Three observationally stable <b>isobars</b> exist for 124.|$|R
500|$|High-pressure {{systems are}} {{alternatively}} {{referred to as}} anticyclones. [...] On English-language weather maps, high-pressure centers are identified by the letter H in English, within the <b>isobar</b> with the highest pressure value. [...] On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Josef Mattauch finally {{formulated}} the <b>isobar</b> rule. One of {{the indirect}} {{consequences of this}} rule was that element 61 was unable to form stable isotopes. From 1938, a nuclear experiment was conducted by H. B. Law et al. at Ohio State University. Nuclides were produced in 1941 which were not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, and the name [...] "cyclonium" [...] was proposed, {{but there was a}} lack of chemical proof that element 61 was produced and the discovery not largely recognized.|$|E
500|$|On Earth, {{tropical}} cyclones span a large {{range of}} sizes, from [...] {{as measured by}} the radius of vanishing wind. They are largest on average in the northwest Pacific Ocean basin and smallest in the northeastern Pacific Ocean basin. If the radius of outermost closed <b>isobar</b> is less than two degrees of latitude (...) , then the cyclone is [...] "very small" [...] or a [...] "midget". A radius of 3–6 latitude degrees (...) is considered [...] "average sized". [...] "Very large" [...] tropical cyclones have a radius of greater than 8degrees (...) [...] Observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity (i.e. maximum wind speed), radius of maximum wind, latitude, and maximum potential intensity.|$|E
25|$|Thus, antitriptic <b>isobars</b> {{need to be}} {{equispaced}} circles or straight lines.|$|R

500|$|Later that day, it made {{landfall}} [...] {{south of}} Miami in South Florida; observers {{reported that the}} small eye produced calm conditions at Goulds, near Homestead. The storm contained peak winds of —equivalent to low-end Category 2 status—and a radius of maximum wind just [...] from the center. Originally, the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT) listed winds of [...] at landfall in South Florida, but reanalysis determined that these winds occurred somewhat earlier, over the eastern Bahamas. Maintaining a small size, the hurricane moved through the Everglades, passing between Everglades City and Fort Myers. The storm entered the Gulf of Mexico as a strong tropical storm and broadly curved toward the northwest, tracking offshore along {{the west coast of}} Florida. It remained over open waters and recovered its intensity until the following day, when it made landfall at Carrabelle with winds of , equivalent to a high-end Category 1 hurricane, and a measured central pressure of [...] The cyclone still exhibited a small radius of outermost closed <b>isobar</b> but had reduced its forward speed.|$|E
500|$|Based on ship reports, {{the storm}} made its only {{landfall}} in the United States on Jupiter Island, between Port Salerno and Hobe Sound, Florida, around 16:00 UTC on July30. Some hours earlier, the American steamship El Almirante encountered hurricane-force winds—the only such instance at sea in the storm—concurrent with a pressure of [...] Another ship nearby made {{a reading of}} [...] coincident with winds of , hinting that it was taken inside {{the eye of the}} storm; calculations by researchers determined that the central pressure was [...] at the time and at landfall in Florida. While this supported winds of only tropical storm force (70 mph (110 km/h)), the storm had a small radius of outermost closed <b>isobar</b> embedded in a ridge of high pressure, so winds in Florida were deemed to be 75 mph (120 km/h), affirming earlier reports that listed the storm as a hurricane at landfall. After landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical storm and moved slowly westward across the south-central peninsula, passing over the northern end of Lake Okeechobee early on July 31. The center of the compact tropical cyclone then passed slightly north of Punta Gorda and reached the Gulf of Mexico, between Venice and Englewood, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h).|$|E
500|$|The methods {{through which}} {{tropical}} cyclones are forecast have {{changed with the}} passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Viñes, S.J., introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. [...] Forecasting hurricane motion was based on tide movements, as well as cloud and barometer changes over time. [...] In 1895, it was noted that cool conditions with unusually high pressure preceded tropical cyclones in the West Indies by several days. [...] Before the early 1900s, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centers via telegraph. [...] It was not until the advent of radio {{in the early twentieth century}} that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. [...] Despite the issuance of hurricane watches and warnings for systems threatening the coast, forecasting the path of tropical cyclones did not occur until 1920. [...] By 1922, it was known that the winds at [...] to [...] in height above the sea surface within the storms' right front quadrant were representative of a storm's steering, and that hurricanes tended to follow the outermost closed <b>isobar</b> of the subtropical ridge.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Isobars</b> are curves {{along which}} the {{principal}} stress, e.g., [...] is constant.|$|R
40|$|Often {{granular}} {{materials are}} stored in vertical containers with circular or square cross sections. The storage material can be food grains, pharmaceutical powders, chemical pellets, or geomaterials such as mine fills. The design and analysis of these containers require adequate knowledge of the stresses developed within the filled material. The stress <b>isobars</b> developed herein enable the designers to estimate the vertical stress at any point within the fill contained in a silo. The same <b>isobars</b> {{can also be used}} for square cross sections, {{as in the case of}} backfilled underground mine stopes, without sacrificing the accuracy much. The same method was previously followed by the authors in developing <b>isobars</b> for plane-strain situations. On the basis of the two sets of <b>isobars</b> for trenches and square stopes, it is possible to interpolate the stresses for other rectangular mine stopes, which can serve as good first estimates in the designs...|$|R

Late on 8 March, an eyewall replacement cycle had begun to take shape, allowing the storm to maintain Category4 intensity for the following few days. By 10 March, the storm finally began {{to show signs of}} steady weakening as shear continued to increase due to an approaching trough from the west. Later that day, the storm began to slow as it moved within a region of light steering currents. Substantial loss of convection took place during this time, causing Hamish to weaken below severe tropical cyclone status by 11 March.|$|E
