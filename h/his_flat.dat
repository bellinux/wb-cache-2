5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate <b>his</b> <b>flat</b> that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
