40|$|The {{stiffness}} and damping moments that are transmitted by <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> during sinusoidal bending were determined {{in the blue}} marlin, Makaira nigricans Lac 6 pede. Using a dynamic bending machine, the angular stiffness (Nmrad " 1) and damping coefficient (kgm 2 rad ~ 2 s ~ 1) of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> were measured over a range of bending frequencies, amplitudes and positions along the backbone. Angular stiffness increases with increasing bending amplitude, but, for some joints, {{the rate at which}} it changes with increasing bending frequency is negative. The precaudal <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> are less stiff than the caudal joints. The damping coefficient, which also shows regional variation, does not change with amplitude but does decrease with increasing bending frequency in joint positions three and five. Stiffness moments along the vertebral column, given the same amount of bending at each joint, are always greater than the damping moments. However, damping moments increase by an order of magnitude with an increase in bending frequency from 0. 5 to 5. 0 Hz. The {{stiffness and}} damping moments determine the work that an external moment, such as muscle, must do over a complete cycle of bending.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the motion {{of a pair of}} vertebras and the ensuing loads exerted by the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint</b> have been studied extensively. In the realm of small and quasi-static motion, this relationship is approximately linear and can be modeled using a 6 × 6 stiffness matrix. Efforts to determine the elements of these stiffness matrices as well as to apply them in models of the joint have been underway since this joint model was first proposed in the early 1970 s. Meanwhile, a considerable amount of theoretical work has been conducted in identifying linear mappings that relate increments in force and moment components acting on a system of rigid bodies to the infinitesimal motions that produced them. Most prominent among these is the Cartesian stiffness matrix parameterization. Alongside these developments, advancements in musculoskeletal software modeling has led to the developments of various software platforms capable of performing the underlying computations necessary to study musculoskeletal structures. The motion of articulating bodies in this case is defined using joints. In the case of the spine, bushing elements - similar to the rubber bushings employed in vehicular dynamics - are a popular alternative. Unfortunately, numerous difficulties exist in adapting these bushing elements to mimic the stiffness matrix model of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint.</b> In this dissertation, we connect the inter-related subjects above {{to pave the way for}} a more comprehensive model of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint.</b> To do this, we derive the Cartesian stiffness matrix associated with the joints of the spine using arguments based on energetics consideration and the Euler angle parameterization of rotations.

40|$|Objective. To make an {{experimental}} {{assessment of the}} Neutral Zone of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> during dynamic spinal motion in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation {{and to develop a}} criterion for its definition. Design. Dynamic mechanical testing of sheep <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> with a six-degree of freedom robotic facility under position control. Background. The Neutral Zone is defined as a region of no or little resistance to motion {{in the middle of an}} intervertebral joint’s range of movement. Previous studies have used quasi-static loading regimes that do not model physiological activity. This study simulated physiological movements using a robotic testing facility to address this issue. Methods. Five spines from mature sheep were used and three motion segments were tested from each spine. The robotic facility enabled the testing regime to be defined for each individual joint based on its geometry. The joints were tested by cycling through the full range of physiological movement in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation. Results. A Neutral Zone was found to exist during dynamic movements only in flexion/extension. The results suggested that a Neutral Zone does not exist in lateral bending or axial rotation. The zygapophysial joints were shown to be significant in determining the mechanics of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> as their removal increased the Neutral Zone in all cases. A new criterion for defining the size of the Neutral Zone during dynamic motion was proposed and its implications for spinal movements in life discussed. Conclusions. A Neutral Zone exists in flexion/extension during dynamic movements of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> and is a feature of the natural range of joint motion.

40|$|International audienceMammalian {{locomotion}} {{is characterized}} by the use of asymmetrical gaits associated with extensive flexions and extensions of the body axis. Although the impact of sagittal spine movements on locomotion is well known, little information is available on the kinematics of spinal motion. Intervertebral joint movements were studied in two metatherian and three eutherian species during the gallop and halfbound using high-speed cineradiography. Fast-Fourier transformation was used to filter out high frequency digitizing errors and keep the lower frequency sinusoid oscillations that characterize the intervertebral angular movements. Independent of their regional classification as thoracic or lumbar vertebrae, 7 +/- 1 presacral <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> were involved in sagittal bending movements. In only one species, no more than five <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> contributed to the resulting 'pelvic movement'. In general, the trunk region involved in sagittal bending during locomotion did not correspond to the traditional subdivisions of the vertebral column (e. g. as thoracic and lumbar or pre- and postdiaphragmatic region). Therefore, these classifications do not predict the regions involved in spinal oscillations during locomotion. Independent of the gait, maximum flexion of the spine was observed in the interval between the last third of the swing phase and touch-down. This results in a retraction of the pelvis and hindlimbs before touch-down and, we hypothesize, enhances the stability of the system. Maximum extension occurred during the first third of the swing phase (i. e. after lift-off) in all species. In general, the observed timing of dorsoventral oscillations of the spine are in accordance with that observed in other mammals and with activity data of respiratory and epaxial back muscles. Although no strict craniocaudal pattern was observable, the more cranial <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> tend to flex and extend earlier than the more caudal ones. This is in accordance with the organization and the activation of the paravertebral musculature in mammals. The amplitude of intervertebral joint movements increased caudally, reaching its highest values in the presacral joint. The more intense sagittal bending movements in the caudal <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> are reflected by the muscle fiber type composition of the back muscles involved. Despite the highly similar amplitude of 'pelvic motion', touch-down and lift-off positions of the pelvis were clearly different between the species with a long, external tail and those with no external tail...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of mammalian <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> are {{complicated by the}} viscoelastic nature of the connective tissues joining vertebrae, and by multiple vertebral articulations and complex morphologies. Further, interspecific variation in these structures can greatly compound their functional variation between species, making comparative mechanical analyses even more difficult. Despite these sources of variation however, mammalian <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> universally exhibit a creep relaxation behaviour based on the viscoelastic nature of the soft tissue joint. We have evaluated, in 6 degrees of freedom, the mechanical signature of a novel mammalian lumbar intervertebral joint found in the Scutisorex spine, and compared it with a more typical mammalian joint in the Rattus (rat) lumbar spine. Scutisorex, the hero shrew, is an East African species of shrew with what is likely the most highly modified vertebral morphology in {{the entire history of}} mammals. Thus we decided to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of the intervertebral joint of this species, comparing it with a more representative mammal species in Rattus. We built a custom, 6 degrees of freedom, intervertebral joint transducer and a combined axial moment and load application system in order to quantify and compare the complex mechanical behaviour of these joints. Our results suggest that the Scutisorex joint is 5 times more resilient to simple axial torsion per body mass unit than Rattus, and that the complex load (combined axial compression and torsion) mechanical signature of Scutisorex is probably novel among all mammalian <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints.</b> Under significant but physiological axial compression the Scutisorex intervertebral joint demonstrates no creep relaxation behaviour, simulating the mechanical behaviour of a rigid construct rather than a viscoelastic joint.

Our goals were to test the effects of centrum morphology and <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint</b> length on mechanical outputs of the {{vertebral column}} using bioinspired models. We expected that centrum angle, joint length, and bending angle would all be significant effects in our statistical models. We designed five 3 -D models inspired by vertebral morphology of fishes, humans, and marine mammals, and models were printed on a 3 -D printer. We constructed 12 motion segments (centrum – joint – centrum) of varying joint length for each centrum morphology. A moment arm was added to one end of the motion segment to insure pure bending and eliminate shear. We tested mechanical properties of motion segments on a materials testing system measuring force (N). From the force outputs we calculated moment (Nm), Work (J), and Bending Stiffness (Nm 2). Increasing the bending angle during testing, increased the moment and work produced by the system, while it decreased the bending stiffness. By increasing joint length we measured decreases in each of those mechanical properties. The marine marine mammal models, regardless of joint length, always had the largest mechanical outputs while the fish model with an intermediate centrum angle had the lowest. These data suggest that convex and flat models are consistently stiffer than concave models. Our data show the relation between centrum shape, joint length, and their associated mechanical outputs is perhaps not linear. Building additional models will allow us to further explore morphospace and better understand the conserved centrum shapes we see in among vertebrate groups.

An in vitro biomechanical study using porcine lumbar motion segments. Background. Repeated bending has been suggested as part of the etiology of gradual prolapse of the intervertebral disc, but the multi-planar changes in bending properties following cyclic loading have not been examined in detail. Methods. Porcine lumbar motion segments were subject to 1500 cycles of bending along directions of 0 ° (flexion), 30 °, 60 °, or 90 ° (right lateral bending). The multi-planar bending moments and hysteresis energies were recorded before loading and after various cycle numbers. Results. Repeated bending at 30 ° and 60 ° resulted in greater decreases in mean bending moment and hysteresis energy than bending at 0 ° or 90 °. No significant differences were seen between loading groups for the change in bending moment along the anterior testing directions, but significant differences were observed in the posterior and lateral testing directions, with bending at 30 ° causing a significantly greater decrease in bending moment in the postero-lateral directions. Conclusions. The change in mechanical properties of porcine <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joints</b> due to cyclic bending depend on the direction of loading and the direction in which the properties are measured.

40|$|Background Lumbar {{segmental}} instability {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a cause of chronic low back pain. However, defining its measurement has been largely limited to laboratory studies. These have characterised segmental stability as the intrinsic resistance of spine specimens to initial bending moments by quantifying the dynamic neutral zone. However these measurements have been impossible to obtain in vivo without invasive procedures, preventing the assessment of intervertebral stability in patients. Quantitative fluoroscopy (QF), measures the initial velocity of the attainment of intervertebral rotational motion in patients, which may to some extent be representative of the dynamic neutral zone. This study sought to explore the possible relationship between the dynamic neutral zone and intervertebral rotational attainment rate as measured with (QF) in an in vitro preparation. The purpose was to find out if further work into this concept is worth pursuing. Method This study used passive recumbent QF in a multi-segmental porcine model. This assessed the intrinsic intervertebral responses to a minimal coronal plane bending moment as measured with a digital force guage. Bending moments about each <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint</b> were calculated and correlated with the rate at which global motion was attained at each intervertebral segment in the first 10 ° of global motion where the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint</b> was rotating. Results Unlike previous studies of single segment specimens, a neutral zone was found to exist during lateral bending. The initial attainment rates for left and right lateral flexion were comparable to previously published in vivo values for healthy controls. Substantial and highly significant levels of correlation between initial attainment rate and neutral zone were found for left (Rho[*]=[*] 0. 75, P[*]=[*] 0. 0002) and combined left-right bending (Rho[*]=[*] 0. 72, P[*]=[*] 0. 0001) and moderate ones for right alone (Rho[*]=[*] 0. 55, P[*]=[*] 0. 0012). Conclusions This study found good correlation between the initial intervertebral attainment rate and the dynamic neutral zone, thereby opening the possibility to detect segmental instability from clinical studies. However the results must be treated with caution. Further studies with multiple specimens and adding sagittal plane motion are warranted. ...|$|R
40|$|A patient {{receiving}} haemodialysis for 15 years developed {{systemic amyloidosis}} of beta 2 microglobulin type. Noticeable deposits of amyloid {{were present in}} the myocardium, <b>intervertebral</b> discs, <b>joint</b> cartilages and tendons. Less conspicuous amounts were present in blood vessel walls in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands and brain, and within the stroma of the prostate, testis and kidney, often with foci of calcification...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{modeling}} {{technique is}} proposed {{to predict the}} strength contour of trunk muscles during isometric exertions, which can identify the feasibility of task performance and quantify the utilization ratio for assessment of risk of development of muscular fatigue and over-exertion injury. In addition, the proposed model can estimate the joint reaction forces during performance of the feasible complex loading task in upright standing. Six anatomical models and six cost functions suggested by various research groups were considered in determining their effects on the predicted three-dimensional strength and lumbar <b>intervertebral</b> <b>joint</b> reaction forces obtained using linear and nonlinear optimizations. The present investigation has shown {{the importance of the}} fidelity of anatomical models used in estimation of spinal loading and trunk strength. The effect of cost functions on estimated compression and anterior-posterior shear forces was statistically significant. These models can assist in identifying the injurious tasks that must be ergonomically modified to prevent the risk of occupationally related low back injuries...|$|R
