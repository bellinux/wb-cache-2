5|$|Ethnic hatred <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> various {{incidents}} {{fueled the}} propaganda machines on both sides. During his {{testimony before the}} ICTY, one of the top-Krajina leaders, Milan Martić, stated that the Serb side started using force first.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the town following a fire in 1731. After this the town's importance <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon, its importance as trade centre enhanced by fires in Taunton and Tiverton. By the 1831 census, 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Major {{tracts of}} the Allen Ranch were {{liquidated}} opening up new development around Pasadena and other bayside communities. Commercial fishing for oysters and shrimp <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a significant area industry. The lumber industry also continued to grow. A sugar refinery opened in Texas city, a paper mill in Pasadena, and other {{factories in the}} early 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Certain plants always <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> vines, {{while a few}} <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> vines {{only part}} of the time. For instance, poison ivy and {{bittersweet}} can <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> low shrubs when support is not available, but will become vines when support is available.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} Taxandria {{generally}} <b>growing</b> <b>as</b> tall shrubs, but Taxandria juniperina grows to tree size (up to 27m) and Taxandria linearifolia can <b>grow</b> <b>as</b> a small tree (up to 5m in height).|$|R
5|$|Outside of cricket, Barnes {{followed}} his mother into property development (see above) and {{at various times}} entered into partnerships with Keith Miller and Norman Von Nida. His suspicious nature, which <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.|$|E
5|$|The Warrington and Stockport Railway was {{constructed}} through Dunham during 1853/54. Dunham Massey railway station served {{the area between}} 1854 and its closure in 1962. Dunham <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a result, the population increasing by 57.5% between 1851 and 1881. Otherwise, the industrial revolution {{had little effect on}} Dunham Massey, and it remained a predominantly agricultural area.|$|E
5|$|The palace {{was bought}} by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief {{residence}} of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions.|$|E

5000|$|In comparison, the {{relative}} error bound for naive summation (simply adding {{the numbers in}} sequence, rounding at each step) <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] multiplied by the condition number. [...] In practice, {{it is much more}} likely that the rounding errors have a random sign, with zero mean, so that they form a random walk; in this case, naive summation has a root mean square relative error that <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] and pairwise summation as an error that <b>grows</b> <b>as</b> [...] on average.|$|R

5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} Bay Area transformed during the 20th century. Following the hurricane, donations by {{the newly established}} Red Cross helped revive area farming communities. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. Commercial fishing, particularly for oysters and shrimp, <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a significant area industry.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Nestlé Purina Petcare is a St. Louis, Missouri-based {{subsidiary}} of Nestlé. It produces and markets pet food, treats and litter. Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company. As consumers became willing {{to spend more money}} on their pets, the company <b>grew.</b> <b>As</b> of 2012, it is the second-largest pet food company globally and the largest in the United States.|$|E

5|$|New York <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> an {{economic}} center, {{first as a}} result of Alexander Hamilton's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and, later, {{with the opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada. By 1810, New York City, then confined to Manhattan, had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson, {{signed the}} Raker Act into law on December 13, 1913, which {{authorized}} {{construction of the}} dam. Hetch Hetchy Reservoir <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> the valley was flooded behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923. The Raker Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} island's formation, seals were seen around the island. They soon began basking there, {{particularly}} on the northern spit, which <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> the waves eroded the island. Seals {{were found to be}} breeding on the island in 1983, and a group of up to 70 made the island their breeding spot. Grey seals are more common on the island than harbour seals, but both are now well established. The presence of seals attracts orcas, which are frequently seen in the waters around the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago and now frequent the waters around Surtsey.|$|E

5|$|The Sivakasi {{municipality}} {{was established}} in 1920. After India's independence from the British in 1947, Sivakasi {{continued to be a}} municipality under the Madras state and later a part of Tamil Nadu, when the state was split on linguistic lines during 1953, 1956 and 1960 and renamed in 1968. It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998 and special-grade in 2013. Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> an industrial town specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries. Several incidents of fire and explosions have occurred in the fireworks factories.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71AD. It became {{the capital of the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, and later of the kingdoms of Northumbria and Jórvík. In the Middle Ages, York <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England, a role it has retained.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning Stephen by name {{dates from}} 30 April 1455, when Pope Callixtus III put the King of Bosnia {{and his son}} under his protection. King Thomas's ambitions for Stephen <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> he strived to establish closer relations with the Western world. In 1456, he asked the Pope to procure a bride for his son, specifying {{that she should be}} a princess from a royal house. Negotiations soon commenced about Stephen's marriage to an illegitimate daughter of Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, but Stephen's father harbored greater ambitions.|$|E

5|$|The need {{to secure}} a {{replacement}} for Melbourne <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> the carrier's age caused the operating costs to increase to over A$25million per year. In June 1977, the Defence Force Development Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a STOVL/helicopter carrier. By August 1979, the decision was limited to three ships: a modified American Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship, an Italian Giuseppe Garibaldi-class carrier, and a Sea Control Ship design that later became the Spanish Navy's Principe de Asturias. By February 1981, the Iwo Jima class was the preferred option.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} subplots {{on the show}} <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a {{variation}} of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s), the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life, Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers, Smiler {{trying to find a}} woman, Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda), and Tom trying to stay {{one step ahead of the}} repo man.|$|E
5|$|Though Eastbourne is a {{relatively}} new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age. The town <b>grew</b> <b>as</b> a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a key feature of Eastbourne.|$|E
