6000|$|PURGANAX: That is {{the very}} thing that I was saying, Gentlemen Swine; the Queen Iona being Most innocent, no doubt, returns to Thebes, [...] 35 And the lean Sows and Bears collect about her, Wishing to make her think that WE believe (I mean those more {{substantial}} Pigs, who swill Rich <b>hog-wash,</b> while the others mouth damp straw) That she is guilty; thus, the Lean-Pig faction [...] 40 Seeks to obtain that <b>hog-wash,</b> which has been Your immemorial right, and which I will Maintain you in to the last drop of-- ...|$|E

6000|$|SWELLFOOT: What! ye who grub With filthy snouts my red {{potatoes}} up In Allan's rushy bog? Who eat the oats [...] 25 Up, from my cavalry in the Hebrides? Who swill the <b>hog-wash</b> soup my cooks digest From bones, and rags, and scraps of shoe-leather, Which {{should be given}} to cleaner Pigs than you? ...|$|E

[...] "I tell ye, gentlemen, I'm sick o' this sort o' <b>hog-wash</b> that's been ladled round to us. That gal Clementina Harcourt and that feller Fletcher had met not only once, but MANY times afore--yes! they were old friends {{if it comes to}} that, a matter of six years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|CHORUS OF SWINE: I {{have heard}} your Laureate sing, That pity was a royal thing; Under your mighty ancestors, we Pigs Were bless'd as nightingales on myrtle sprigs, [...] 40 Or {{grasshoppers}} that live on noonday dew, And sung, old annals tell, as sweetly too; But now our sties are fallen in, we catch The murrain and the mange, the scab and itch; Sometimes your royal dogs tear down our thatch, [...] 45 And then we seek {{the shelter of}} a ditch; <b>Hog-wash</b> or grains, or ruta-baga, none Has yet been ours since your reign begun.|$|E
6000|$|SEMICHORUS: Happier Swine {{were they}} than we, [...] 55 Drowned in the Gadarean sea-- I wish that pity would {{drive out the}} devils, Which in your royal bosom hold their revels, And sink us in the waves of thy compassion! Alas! the Pigs are an unhappy nation! [...] 60 Now if your Majesty would have our {{bristles}} To bind your mortar with, or fill our colons With rich blood, or make brawn out of our gristles, In policy--ask else your royal Solons-- You ought to give us <b>hog-wash</b> and clean straw, [...] 65 And sties well thatched; besides it is the law! ...|$|E
6000|$|CHORUS: <b>Hog-wash</b> {{has been}} ta'en away: If the Bull-Queen is divested, We shall be {{in every way}} Hunted, stripped, exposed, molested; [...] 140 Let us do whate'er we may, That she shall not be arrested. QUEEN, we entrench you with walls of brawn, And palisades of tusks, sharp as a bayonet: Place your most sacred person here. We pawn [...] 145 Our lives that none a finger dare to lay on it. Those who wrong you, wrong us; Those who hate you, hate us; Those who sting you, sting us; Those who bait you, bait us; [...] 150 The ORACLE is now about to be Fulfilled by circumvolving destiny; Which says: 'Thebes, choose REFORM or CIVIL WAR, When through your streets, instead of hare with dogs, A CONSORT QUEEN shall hunt a KING with Hogs, [...] 155 Riding upon the IONIAN MINOTAUR.' ...|$|E

She disputed with me {{a quarter of an}} hour yesterday about the cooking of the beef; she said I boiled it to rags, that English people would never be able to eat such a dish as our bouilli, that the bouillon was no better than greasy warm water, and as to the choucroute, she affirms she cannot touch it! That barrel we have in the cellar--delightfully prepared by my own hands--she termed a tub of <b>hog-wash,</b> which means food for pigs. I am harassed with the girl, and yet I cannot part with her lest I should get a worse. You are in the same position with your workmen, pauvre cher fr√®re!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{what other}} things Low had deceived him {{he did not}} say; but, to the astonishment of both men, Dunn growled a dissent to Brace's proposition. Either from some secret {{irritation}} with that possible rival, or impatience at the prolonged absence of Nellie, he had [...] "had enough {{of that sort of}} <b>hog-wash</b> ladled out to him for genuine liquor." [...] As to the Carquinez Woods, he [Dunn] [...] "didn't know why Low hadn't as much right there as if he'd grabbed it under a preemption law and didn't live there." [...] With this hint at certain speculations of Father Wynn in public lands for a homestead, he added that [...] "If they [Brace and Wynn] could bring him along any older American settler than an Indian, they might rake down his [Dunn's] pile." [...] Unprepared for this turn in the conversation, Wynn hastened to explain that he did not refer to the pure aborigine, whose gradual extinction no one regretted more than himself, but to the mongrel, who inherited only the vices of civilization. [...] "There should be a law, sir, against the mingling of races. There are men, sir, who violate the laws of the Most High by living with Indian women--squaw men, sir, as they are called." ...|$|E
6000|$|PURGANAX: Grant me your {{patience}}, Gentlemen and Boars, Ye, by whose patience under public burthens The glorious {{constitution of}} these sties Subsists, and shall subsist. The Lean-Pig rates Grow {{with the growing}} populace of Swine, [...] 5 The taxes, that true source of Piggishness (How can I find a more appropriate term To include religion, morals, peace, and plenty, And all that fit Boeotia as a nation To teach the other nations how to live?), [...] 10 Increase with Piggishness itself; and still Does the revenue, that great spring of all The patronage, and pensions, and by-payments, Which free-born Pigs regard with jealous eyes, Diminish, till at length, by glorious steps, [...] 15 All the land's produce will be merged in taxes, And the revenue will amount to--nothing! The failure of a foreign market for Sausages, bristles, and blood-puddings, And such home manufactures, is but partial; [...] 20 And, that {{the population of the}} Pigs, Instead of <b>hog-wash,</b> has been fed on straw And water, is a fact which is--you know-- That is--it is a state-necessity-- Temporary, of course. Those impious Pigs, [...] 25 Who, by frequent squeaks, have dared impugn The settled Swellfoot system, or to make Irreverent mockery of the genuflexions Inculcated by the arch-priest, have been whipped Into a loyal and an orthodox whine.
