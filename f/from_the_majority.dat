5|$|On release, The Beatles {{received}} favourable reviews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> {{of music}} critics, but other commentators found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent {{political and social}} climate of 1968. The band and Martin have since debated whether the group should have released a single album instead. Nonetheless, The Beatles reached {{number one on the}} charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States and has since been viewed by some critics {{as one of the greatest}} albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|Star Fox Adventures {{features}} {{both the}} established main {{characters of the}} Star Fox series—Fox, Falco Lombardi, Slippy Toad and Peppy Hare (though Falco is absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the game), {{as well as a}} host of new characters, including a mysterious blue fox named Krystal and the small dinosaur Prince Tricky. The entire planet is populated with dinosaurs, like the tyrannical General Scales, and other prehistoric animals such as pterosaurs and mammoths.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella gloiocephala and related taxa are a {{separate}} clade <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the species}} traditionally classified in Volvariella and therefore another name change was necessary, now as the type species of the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> party in the assembly. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E

5|$|In 1190, York Castle was the {{location}} {{of one of the}} worst pogroms in England during the medieval period. The Normans had introduced , where some occupied a special economic role as moneylenders, an essential but otherwise banned activity. English Jews were subject to considerable religious prejudice and primarily worked from towns and cities in which there was a local royal castle that could provide them with protection in the event of attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> Christian population. Royal protection was usually granted as the Norman and Angevin kings had determined that Jewish property and debts owed to Jews ultimately belonged to the crown, reverting to the king on a Jew's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1853 Paraná {{was again}} {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Council of Ministers, {{at the head of}} a highly successful cabinet, and became the most powerful politician in the country. The electoral reform he ushered in was credited with undermining national political processes and causing severe harm to the system of parliamentary government. For his role in pushing through restructuring, Paraná met with fierce opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of his colleagues, leading to a virtual split in the Conservative Party over his policies. On 3 September 1856, while still in office and at the height of his political career, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. He is widely regarded by historians as one of the most influential statesmen of his time.|$|E
5|$|In the Year of Four Emperors, 69AD, the Iazyges {{gave their}} support to Vespasian, {{who went on}} to become the sole emperor of Rome. The Iazyges also offered to guard the Roman border with the Dacians, in order to free up troops for Vespasian's {{invasion}} of Italy; however, Vespasian refused, fearing that they would attempt a takeover or defect. Vespasian did require the chiefs of the Iazyges to serve in his army, so that they could not organize an attack on the undefended area around the Danube. Vespasian enjoyed support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the Germanic and Dacian tribes.|$|E

5|$|Since Alvarado's {{supporters}} {{had been}} confirmed {{in the town}} council of Gracias a Dios, and used obscure legalistic arguments to refuse Cáceres' authority, he withdrew to a nearby Indian village and plotted to overthrow the town council. The Spanish infighting encouraged the local Indians in their defiance of the invaders. Cáceres launched a coup at dawn early in 1537, entered Gracias a Dios with twenty well-armed soldiers and imprisoned the town council, including Gonzalo de Alvarado. Cáceres declared Montejo as governor of Honduras-Higueras, and named himself as lieutenant governor and captain-general. He met little opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the Spanish citizens, and appointed a new town council.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening of the}} General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella earlei {{is closely related}} to Volvariella gloiocephala and that this group of species {{constitutes}} a separate lineage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella. Therefore, this taxon was transferred to the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus. The specific epithet earlei comes from the surname of Franklin Sumner Earle, the collector of the original samples, to whom Murrill dedicated the species. The original specimens of this species are still preserved at the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden.|$|E

30|$|Statistic-based filtering: Further {{techniques}} {{that are used}} to enhance the robustness of trust models against the spread of false rumors apply statistical patterns. Whitby et al. [16], for example, proposed a statistical filter technique to filter out unfair ratings in Bayesian reputation systems applying <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> rule. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> rule considers feedback that is far away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> referrals as dishonest. In this way, dishonest or false feedback can easily be detected and filtered.|$|R
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service, feudal obligations and money contracts of bonds of manrent. In 1513 these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but there is evidence that by the mid-sixteenth century the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign and noblemen became indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of troops. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the plaid. Weapons included various forms of axes and pole arms. Highland troops brought bows and two-handed swords (claidheamh mór). The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. The pike began to replace the spear or axe and the bow began to be replaced by gunpowder firearms. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies and the Scots fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the borders. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a gun foundry in 1511. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture from the mid-fifteenth century. In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles.|$|E
