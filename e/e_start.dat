Bellcore's Touring Machine proposes a different approach: let developers of multimedia applications specify an interface, and then design a network that meets the specification. Each approach has relevance, and an ideal environment must incorporate both, but questions remain about how the two perspectives fit together. We have contrasted and compared the Lancaster and Touring Machine approaches in an attempt to integrate their individual perspectives into one design. This paper documents our results...|$|E

This class is basically characterized {{by the fact that}} algorithms operate in a bottom-up recursive way on the expressions, i. <b>e.</b> <b>start</b> from the atomic terms—constants and variables—and perform the simplifications on larger and larger terms until the whole expression is ultimately proceeded; no backtracking or iterated process should intervene in the simplification. We show that under these quite general assumptions, it is possible to analyze precisely, and almost automatically, the average size of the resulting expressions—the gain in space—and the average time complexity of the process, which happens to be linear, whereas the worst-case behaviour is not in general...|$|E

For three publicly available egocentric datasets, we uncover inconsistencies in ground truth temporal bounds {{within and across}} annotators and datasets. We systematically assess the robustness of state-of-the-art approaches to changes in labeled temporal bounds, for object interaction recognition. As boundaries are trespassed, a drop of up to 10 % is observed for both Improved Dense Trajectories and Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network. We demonstrate that such disagreement stems from a limited understanding of the distinct phases of an action, and propose annotating based on the Rubicon Boundaries, inspired by a similarly named cognitive model, for consistent temporal bounds of object interactions. Evaluated on a public dataset, we report a 4 % increase in overall accuracy, {{and an increase in}} accuracy for 55 % of classes when Rubicon Boundaries are used for temporal annotations.

40|$|Abstract. Despite the omnipresence {{of event}} logs in {{transactional}} infor-mation systems (cf. WFM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B 2 B systems), historic information is rarely {{used to analyze}} the underlying processes. Process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and social structures from event logs, i. e., the basic idea of process mining is to diagnose busi-ness processes by mining event logs for knowledge. Given its potential and challenges {{it is no surprise that}} recently process mining has become a vivid research area [5, 6]. In this paper, a novel approach for process mining based on two event types, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>START</b> and COMPLETE, is pro-posed. Information about the start and completion of tasks can be used to explicitly detect parallelism. The algorithm presented in this paper overcomes some of the limitations of existing algorithms such as the α-algorithm (e. g., short-loops) and therefore enhances the applicability of process mining. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractS phase entry, i. <b>e.</b> <b>start</b> of DNA replication, is {{a crucial}} step in proliferation. Inhibition of S phase entry {{correlates}} with inhibition of hyposine formation, an event affecting only the eukaryotic initiation factor 5 A (eIF- 5 A). Its hyposine-containing sequence was postulated to authorize polysomal utilization of specific transcripts for proteins necessary to enable DNA replication. Using mimosine to reversibly suppress the hypusine-forming deoxyhypusyl hydroxylase (E. C. 1. 14. 99. 29) in cells while differentially displaying their polysomal versus non-polysomal mRNA populations, we report the detection and classification of several mRNA species that indeed disappear from and reappear at polysomes in concert with inhibition and disinhibition, respectively, of hypusine formation. Based on initial sequence data, two translationally controlled enzymes, both critical for proliferation, are identified as candicate products of such mRNAs, methionine adenosyltransferase (E. C. 2. 5. 1. 6) and cytochrome-c oxidase (EC 1. 9. 3. 1) subunit I.

40|$|Abstract Humans have degrees-of-freedom (dof) of varyingbandwidths. One can casually {{observe that}} they {{coordinate}} their joints while visually tracking and sug-gests that joint interplay effects tracking performance. In a control scheme we call partitioning, both imageand kinematic data {{are used to}} visually-servo a 5 -dof robot by defining a joint-coupling among rotationaland translational dof. Performance analysis will illustrate how joint-coupling {{can be used to}} improve visual-servoed tracking. Simulations and experiments highlight results. 1 Introduction People display interesting behaviors when visuallytracking moving targets. First, we engage several joints (eye pan, neck, torso etc) when tracking andtheir motions suggest a kinematic joint coupling. For example, both eyes and neck typically pan in the samedirection. Second, when tracking, the eyes lead (i. <b>e.</b> <b>start</b> panning before) the neck. A possible explana-tion for such behavior is that joints with faster response times serve as compensators for joints that areslower to react. With these behaviors, people track targets quite well despite large variations in targetmotions. This hints that integration of such behaviors into a visually servoed robot may improve its trackingperformance...|$|E

40|$|In WCDMA 3 rd Generation (3 G) systems {{although}} {{there is no need for}} frequency planning as the case with second generation (2 G) systems, the limitation of both capacity and coverage by the interference level in the system rendered the planning task for 3 G systems far more complex than 2 G systems. As the 3 G radio networks now more sensitive to radio environment and traffic conditions, the advantage of dropping frequency planning could be cumbersome due to difficulties linked to what is called Cell-Breathing Phenomenon (CBP). In this work we propose a Dynamic WCDMA system that adjusts the spreading factor adaptively to overcome this problem. The simulation design will have the output of mapping the network load in terms of the number of users to the E b/N 0 required; this will give the network controller an idea about the number and type of users that may cause coverage to shrink i. <b>e.</b> <b>start</b> cell breathing.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{framework}} to represent and analyze dynamic facial motions using a decomposable generative model. In this paper, we consider facial expressions which lie on a one dimensional closed manifold, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>start</b> from some configuration {{and coming back}} to the same configuration, while there are other sources of variability such as different classes of expression, and different people, etc., all of which are needed to be parameterized. The learned model supports tasks such as facial expression recognition, person identification, and synthesis. We aim to learn a generative model that can generate different dynamic facial appearances for different people and for different expressions. Given a single image or a sequence of images, we can use the model to solve for the temporal embedding, expression type and person identification parameters. As a result we can directly infer intensity of facial expression, expression type, and person identity from the visual input. The model can successfully be used to recognize expressions performed by different people never seen during training. We show experiment results for applying the framework for simultaneous face and facial expression recognition. Sub-categories: 1. 1 Novel algorithms, 1. 6 Others: modeling facial expression...|$|E

40|$|Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite {{graphical}} model {{that is used}} as the building block in energy-based deep generative models. Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood, RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units [...] called leaky RBM. We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions. The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; [...] i. <b>e.,</b> <b>start</b> from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.
