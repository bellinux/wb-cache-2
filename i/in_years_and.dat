5|$|Looking {{to improve}} their on-field product, and also to find a player with talent and star power to better compete with the Jets for New York fans' affections, the Giants {{acquired}} quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings before the 1967 season and showed improvement. They finished 7–7 in both the 1967 and 1968 seasons. In those seasons, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl by amassing over 2,200 yards and 21 touchdowns. The team also upset the division champion Dallas Cowboys 27–21 {{in one of their}} biggest wins <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> the Giants' jubilant players carried Sherman off the field on their shoulders. After the game, Wellington Mara said he expected Sherman to remain the team's coach for several more seasons, however, after starting 7–3 they lost their final four games.|$|E
5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed.

One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older <b>in</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, {{and as a matter of}} course made many enemies.|$|E
