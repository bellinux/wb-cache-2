40|$|The proton {{adsorption}} {{behavior of}} eight humic acids (HA) and a fulvic acid (FA) was studied {{as a function}} of pH and KNO 3 concentration. The emphasis is on the comparison of the different humics with respect to their ion binding properties and on the comparison of two different models to describe the electrostatic interactions: the Donnan model and the impermeable sphere (IS) model. Viscosimetric data were used to estimate the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volumes</b> and radii of the HA molecules. These data were incorporated in the electrostatic models and calculations could be carried out without any adjustable parameter. The Donnan model in combination with <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volumes</b> obtained by viscometry cannot adequately describe the electrostatic effects related to changes of the electrolyte concentration. This model leads to good prediction of the HA behavior if unrealistically large volumes are used for fulvics and unrealistically large volume-salt concentration dependencies are used for humics. The IS model can successfully reproduce experimental proton adsorption data with physically realistic radii. The good performance of the IS model and the poor performance of the Donnan model {{is directly related to the}} fact that the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volumes</b> of the molecules are too small to allow for charge compensation within the molecular limits. The combination of viscometry with the IS model leads to a consistent description of the electrostatic in humics and to a consistent way of positioning the master curves. Therefore, the electrostatic potentials and the intrinsic affinity distributions of the different samples can be compared on an equal basis. The similarities in the intrinsic affinity distributions give faith for the possibility to develop a generic model to describe the ion binding to humics...|$|R

The limited accessibility of stationary phase pore volume for the polymer molecules results in shorter elution times for high-molecular-mass species. The use of low dispersity standards allows the user to correlate retention time with molecular mass, although the actual correlation is with the <b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>volume.</b> If the relationship between molar mass and the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volume</b> changes (i.e., the polymer is {{not exactly the same}} shape as the standard) then the calibration for mass is in error.|$|E

DPP itself has a high quantum yield of fluorescence, {{as well as a}} high molar decadic absorption coefficient, epsilon (epsilon = 33000 L(.) mol(- 1.) cm(- 1)). The dendrimers, which differ by their substitution pattern, either at the nitrogen (DPPN) or at the carbon (DPPC), are studied in various solvents with different viscosity and solvent-probe interaction and this for several generations and thus varying molecular volume. The stationary measurements show no difference in the absorption and emission spectra for the different generations nor a solvent-effect. Single photon timing is used to determine the fluorescence lifetime, tau. For both dendrimers, the decay curves can be fitted to a monoexponential model.

30|$|Below this concentration, the van der Waals’ {{forces and}} {{hydrogen}} bonds are {{not strong enough}} to form a three-dimensional space network structure with relatively small <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volumes.</b> Therefore, the rising trend in the viscosity of HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant with concentrations from 500 to 800  mg L− 1 is lower than that of the linear polymer (Fig.  3).

This finding suggests that 0.08  wt% is the critical association concentration (CAC) of the HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant, above which the polymer–surfactant molecules interact with one another through nodes and chains and form a super-molecular structure, which is some type of “dynamic crosslinking network structure” that significantly increases the viscosity of the polymer solution.

50|$|Still, {{the use of}} the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volume,</b> a size {{based on}} {{dynamical}} properties, in the interpretation of SEC data is not fully understood. This is because SEC is typically run under low flow rate conditions where hydrodynamic factor should have little effect on the separation. In fact, both theory and computer simulations assume a thermodynamic separation principle: the separation process is determined by the equilibrium distribution (partitioning) of solute macromolecules between two phases --- a dilute bulk solution phase located at the interstitial space and confined solution phases within the pores of column packing material. Based on this theory, {{it has been shown that}} the relevant size parameter to the partitioning of polymers in pores is the mean span dimension (mean maximal projection onto a line).

Branched molecules of a certain molecular weight exhibit the same <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volumes</b> as linear molecules of substantially lower weights.

Chromatographic separation of the polymer molecules in sub-μm channels, known as molecular-topology fractionation (MTF), may provide a better separation based on topological differences among sample molecules. MTF elution volumes depend on both the topology and molar mass. Therefore co-elution of branched molecules with linear molecules of lower molar mass may also occur in this separation. Because SEC and MTF exhibit significantly different selectivity, the best and clearest separations can be achieved by combining the two techniques in a comprehensive two-dimensional (MTF × SEC) separation system.

In order to gain information about a polydisperse mixture of molar masses, a method for separating the different sizes was developed.

50|$|Gel {{permeation}} chromatography (GPC) {{has become}} the most widely used technique for analyzing polymer samples in order to determine their molecular weights and weight distributions. Examples of GPC chromatograms of polystyrene samples with their molecular weights and PDIs are shown on the left. Benoit and co-workers proposed that the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volume,</b> Vη, which is proportional to the product of η and M, where η is the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer in the SEC eluent, may be used as the universal calibration parameter. If the Mark-Houwink-Sakurada constants K and α are known (see Mark-Houwink equation), a plot of log ηM versus elution volume (or elution time) for a particular solvent, column and instrument provides a universal calibration curve which can be used for any polymer in that solvent. By determining the retention volumes (or times) of monodisperse polymer standards (e.g. solutions of monodispersed polystyrene in THF), a calibration curve can be obtained by plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight versus the retention time or volume. Once the calibration curve is obtained, the gel permeation chromatogram of any other polymer can be obtained in the same solvent and the molecular weights (usually Mn and Mw) and the complete molecular weight distribution for the polymer can be determined.

5000|$|GPC {{separates}} {{based on}} the size or <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>volume</b> (radius of gyration) of the analytes. This differs from other separation techniques which depend upon chemical or physical interactions to separate analytes. [...] Separation occurs via the use of porous beads packed in a column (see stationary phase (chemistry)). The smaller analytes can enter the pores more easily and therefore {{spend more time in}} these pores, increasing their retention time. These smaller molecules spend more time in the column and therefore will elute last. Conversely, larger analytes spend little if any time in the pores and are eluted quickly. All columns have a range of molecular weights that can be separated. If an analyte is either too large or too small, it will be either not retained or completely retained, respectively. Analytes that are not retained are eluted with the free volume outside of the particles (Vo), while analytes that are completely retained are eluted with volume of solvent held in the pores (Vi). The total volume can be considered by the following equation, where Vg is the volume of the polymer gel and Vt is the total volume: As can be inferred, there is a limited range of molecular weights that can be separated by each column and therefore the size of the pores for the packing should be chosen according to the range of molecular weight of analytes to be separated. For polymer separations the pore sizes should be on the order of the polymers being analyzed. If a sample has a broad molecular weight range {{it may be necessary to}} use several GPC columns in tandem with one another to fully resolve the sample.|$|E

On comparison with glycans from other Leishmania spp. and strains, these two oligosaccharides were consistently found to be the predominant promastigote structures. Following transformation to the amastigote stage, alterations in N-linked oligosaccharides appeared to be less consistent between species. L. m. mexicana amastigotes were found to display the same G 10. 5 and G 9. 6 glycans found on promastigotes while L. donovani LV 9 amastigotes were found to be devoid of N-linked glycans...|$|R
