500|$|Zack Handlen {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, I really want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> next". He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active {{in the development of}} humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was [...] "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, which is pretty much where [...] is at now." ...|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

Instead, on July 4, 2012, he published an open letter on his Tumblr blog recounting unrequited feelings he had for another young man when he was 19 years old, citing it as his first true love. He used the blog to thank the man for his influence, and also thanked his mother and other friends, saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore...I feel like a free man." ...|$|E

2500|$|New {{cast members}} were told before being hired {{that they would}} be sworn to secrecy about the plot. According to {{producer}} Richard Stokes, some of the new cast were surprised at the requirement. [...] "What was really interesting was the new cast members saying 'what do you mean we won't know'. Some lead actors want to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> at the end so they can pitch their performance to it. In this they have to trust Chris and have to trust the directors." [...] Cast members swore not to reveal any details of series two, and were required to sign legally binding non-disclosure agreements. (The Daily Mail called them [...] "the most rigorous confidentiality agreements in the industry.") Daily call sheets used pseudonyms for cast members and characters. Scripts were individually watermarked to prevent them from being photocopied, used pseudonyms for characters, and were locked away by security guards when not in use by the actors. Each actor's or crew member's script had the individual's name watermarked across the page as well, so that leaks could {{be traced back to the}} person responsible.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{directed}} mindfulness {{so that it}} {{was keeping}} closely aware of the mind, following it to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> at death. Mindfulness stayed with the heart right up to the final moment when only the barest awareness remained. A feeling was present that to release that faint degree of awareness would be death. At this point, the question became whether {{it would be better for}} me to let go and allow death to take place. I felt that my heart was currently quite pure and that if I were to let go, I wouldn't lose because of it. Although there also remained a delicate feeling that expressed the thought that: 'rather than letting go and die, by remaining alive, I could continue to be of benefit to other people. If it were all to finish here with my death, then it could only be to my own purely personal advantage. Also, people wouldn't know the full circumstances and causes of this death. If that's the case, it's certainly better not to let myself die.' I therefore attempted to wiggle and move my hands and feet, until I came around." ...|$|E
2500|$|Casting for Broadchurch series one was {{overseen by}} casting {{directors}} Kelly Valentine Hendry and Victor Jenkins of VHJ Casting. New series two cast members included James D'Arcy, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Eve Myles, Charlotte Rampling, Meera Syal, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. None {{of the new}} characters were connected to the Latimer murder or any other homicide, Chibnall said. Rampling {{was named to the}} cast on 12 May, and Chibnall said her [...] "character {{is an integral part of}} the new story". He decided to ask Rampling to join the cast after seeing her perform in a video art piece directed by Steve McQueen. [...] "She was so lively and mischievous but also tough and steely and I thought, that's such a match for how I see this character," [...] Chibnall said. ITV announced that D'Arcy, Jean-Baptiste, Myles, and Waller-Bridge were joining the series on 21 May 2014. Rampling, who lives in France, had seen series one on French television and was a fan of the programme. [...] "The sense of community, the idea of solidarity in a small town — all that is broken when suspicion starts to creep in. There is something very human about it. You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> in real life when people suffer this kind of tragedy. People go off and live their lives.

Everything was torpid. There was no interest in the newspapers,--except when Mr. Slide took the tomahawk into his hands.

One of the most moving sources of our national excitement seemed to have vanished from life. We all <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to stagnant waters. So said the Boffinites, and so also now said Sir Orlando. But the Government was carried on and the country was prosperous.
