5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the younger}} captives, however, were not ransomed, as they were adopted into the tribes. [...] Such {{was the case with}} Williams' {{daughter}} Eunice, who was eight years old when captured. She became thoroughly assimilated in her Mohawk family, and married a Mohawk man when she was 16. She did not see her <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> again until much later and always returned to Kahnawake. Other captives also remained by choice in Canadian and Native communities such as Kahnawake {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
500|$|Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately cognatic (derived {{through both}} males and females), in early modern Scotland kinship was agnatic (with {{members of a group}} sharing a, {{sometimes}} fictional, common ancestor through only the male line). Women retained the original surname of their <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> at marriage and marriages were intended to create alliances between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship that joined two families together. In the Borders, on both the English and Scottish sides, there were extensive bonds of kinship, often reflected in a common surname. A shared surname has been seen as a [...] "test of kinship", proving large bodies of kin who could call on each other’s support. At the beginning of the period this could help intensify the idea of the feud. Feuds were semi-formalised disputes, often motivated by revenge for past actions against a member of kin. In a surname system large bodies of kin could be counted on to support rival sides, resulting in long-term local warfare, although conflict between members of kin groups also occurred. From the reign of James VI (r. 1567–1625), systems of judicial law were enforced, aided by the Union of Crowns in 1603 that dissolved much of the political significance of the border. The leadership of the heads of the great surnames was largely replaced by the authority of landholding lairds in the seventeenth century and by the early eighteenth century the feud had been almost completely suppressed.|$|E
40|$|In {{undertaking}} our own separate {{research projects}} {{and in our}} crosscontinental comparative analyses of those projects, we {{became aware of the}} gaps between the richness of research on GLBT lives, including experiences of intimacy and parenthood, and the paucity of research on their relations with their <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Still marginal is, in particular, research on the perspectives <b>of</b> the <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> themselves: parents, but also siblings, grandparents, and other members <b>of</b> extended <b>families.</b> For the purposes of this special issue, we are deploying the term <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to mean heterosexual-identifying family members (at least as they publicly perform and display their sexualities), living within a heteronormative socio-politicocultural system. As we will argue in this introduction, however, {{there is a need to}} document and research, and thereby historically situate, family diversity, including the increasing shifting discourses and lived experiences of same-sex and other queer <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin...</b>|$|R
40|$|Foster carers are {{amongst the}} main actors facing the {{challenges}} on a day-to- day basis when contact related issues arise. Twenty-one Maltese foster carers reported their views about contact and discussed {{the benefits and}} their concerns regarding contact between fostered children and the <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Foster carers’ views were elicited and subjected to a thematic analysis. This paper presents different themes reported by foster carers about contact between children and the <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Emotions were present when contact experiences were discussed by foster carers. Despite the difficulties and apprehension, carers believed in children maintaining contact. Some carers even {{went to great lengths}} in supporting children to establish contact with their <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> This paper also explores how managing contact is mitigated through the support of social work intervention. peer-reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Major {{factors that}} affect both the {{pathology}} and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, {{the age at which}} it occurred, and the child’s <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> [...] Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{seems to}} favor the {{hypothesis}} that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways, but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions. [...] Some have argued {{that there may be}} evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence. [...] For example, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> [...] In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults. [...] Risktaking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates. Research also indicates that baseline sensation seeking may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan.|$|E

50|$|The {{separation}} {{of young adults}} from their families of origin {{in order to create}} families of their own is part of normal human development. According to Bowen theory, this separation can be achieved in a healthy and gradual manner that preserves the intergenerational relationships of the <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> providing both the new family and <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> with a sense of continuity and support. Alternately, a schism can differentiate these life stages. Familial estrangement falls into the second category.|$|E
