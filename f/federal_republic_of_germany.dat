In 1984, von Weizsäcker was elected as President of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany.</b> During his presidency, German reunification was accomplished through the incorporation of {{the territory of the}} former German Democratic Republic into the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> on 3 October 1990.|$|E
5|$|With {{relations}} deteriorating {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, the three western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation {{and allow the}} formation of what became the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany,</b> commonly known as West Germany. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany.|$|E
5|$|The wartime Allies {{initially}} {{worked together}} {{under the auspices of}} the Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany. Cooperation between the Western Allies and the Soviets ultimately broke down because of disagreements over Germany's political and economic future. In May 1949, the three western occupation zones were merged to form the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> (FRG) with a freely elected government. The Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR), under communist rule.|$|E

5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Third Reich, Hess was {{nominated}} to serve again as a judge in Düsseldorf but declined, as he did not wish to work alongside former colleagues who {{had been part of the}} Nazi judicial system. He started a new career in the railways in 1946, and from 1949–55 served as President of the German Federal Railways Authority in Frankfurt am Main. He was awarded a Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> and was given a plaque of honour by the city of Frankfurt in 1970. He died there on 14 September 1983.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied and Soviet occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E

The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.|$|E
5|$|He emigrated {{with his}} family to Bolzano in Italy to escape Nazi {{persecution}} but was eventually forced to move back to Germany, though as a former war comrade of Hitler's he was granted protection and some privileges for a while. However, his privileges were removed in 1941 and he {{spent the rest of the}} war as a forced labourer; his sister died in Auschwitz but his mother managed to escape to Switzerland in 1945. Following the war he began a new career in railway management and was awarded the Order of Merit of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> for his services to the Deutsche Bundesbahn.|$|E
5|$|The united Germany is {{considered}} to be the enlarged continuation of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> and not a successor state. As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organisations. Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries. The relocation of the government was completed in 1999. Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party. Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after {{the border between the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany,</b> the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|No German {{team was}} allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz. Brundage {{was anxious to}} reintegrate Germany into the Olympic {{movement}} once the <b>Federal</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> (West Germany, through Brundage's lifetime) was formed in 1949. Soon after the state's formation, its National Olympic Committee approached the IOC, seeking recognition, {{but there was still}} much animus towards Germany. Just prior to the IOC session in Vienna in 1951 (Brundage was still vice president), the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) also formed an NOC and requested recognition. This created controversy, as the Federal Republic and its NOC claimed to represent both West and East Germany, but did not control the latter. Despite lengthy discussions, no resolution was reached in 1951, and the matter was put over until February 1952, when a negotiating session was scheduled for Copenhagen. Although the East Germans came to Copenhagen, they refused to attend the session, which was eventually cancelled by Edström after the IOC officials and West Germans waited for hours in vain. The German team which competed in Helsinki that summer was entirely West German.|$|E
