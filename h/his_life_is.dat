5|$|Now that I am in baseball, {{just watch}} the game I play. If I catch any crook in baseball, the rest of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> {{going to be a}} pretty hot one. I'll go to any means and to {{anything}} possible to see that he gets a real penalty for his offense.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), the {{negative}} impact fatherhood has had on his life. They both decide to get vasectomies from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell). While waiting, Jack discovers the respect Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), has for his father. After being put under, Tracy realizes <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> horrible {{because he does not}} have a daughter. Luckily, Jack is able to stop Dr. Spaceman before he conducts the procedure.|$|E
5|$|Patient Zero (Clarence Williams III) {{tries to}} hail a taxi {{on a busy}} street, but is {{continually}} ignored. He is eventually picked up by Gerome Knox (Ricky Harris), but suffers a seizure {{in the back of}} the taxi, raving about a threat against his life. Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease.|$|E
50|$|Since a person's {{character}} remains unchanged, if {{the circumstances}} of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>were</b> unchanged, could <b>his</b> <b>life</b> have <b>been</b> different? No.|$|R
60|$|But {{the male}} in him was scotched by the {{knowledge}} that she was not under his spell nor his influence. He wanted to go away from her. He rested in the knowledge that to-morrow he <b>was</b> going away, <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> really elsewhere. <b>His</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> elsewhere--his <b>life</b> <b>was</b> elsewhere--the centre of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> not what she would have. She was different--there was a breach between them. They were hostile worlds.|$|R

5|$|The {{institution}} of marriage is stated to have come into existence after he married {{to set an example}} for other humans to follow. <b>His</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> also credited by Jains with starting the {{institution of}} charity (daana) from layperson to mendicants, when he received surgarcane juice in his hand from king Sreyamsa, to break his fast. This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E
5|$|Tytila (died around 616) was a semi-historical pagan king of East Anglia, a small Anglo-Saxon kingdom {{which today}} {{includes}} the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. Early sources, including Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, identify {{him as an}} early member of the Wuffingas dynasty who succeeded his father Wuffa. A later chronicle dates his reign from 578, {{but he is not}} known to have definitely ruled as king and nothing of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> known. He is listed in a number of genealogical lists.|$|E
5|$|Work on The Simpsons {{involved}} an irregular schedule. The producers laid off the animation staff for two-to-three-month periods, and rehired the staff {{later in the}} production cycle. During one of these layoffs, Povenmire found a temporary job on the series Rocko's Modern Life, Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production. The show's creator, television newcomer Joe Murray, hired Povenmire solely {{on the strength of}} <b>his</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> a Fish comic strips, which proved he could both write and draw.|$|E
50|$|Much of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> {{spent as}} a {{political}} prisoner.|$|R

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the biography of}} the saint Georgian monarch, David the Builder, analyzes his actions, church, external and internal policy. Finally it draws a conclusion that all <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> dedicated {{to the service of}} God and neighbor. Thus, <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> a model of Christian Ministry, he occupied a responsible position in society...|$|R
5|$|In {{the town}} of Glenview, Ohio, Evan Trautwig (Ben Stiller) is an active {{participant}} in the community and senior manager of the local Costco store. <b>His</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> disrupted when the store's night security guard is murdered. The local police have no leads and show no interest in investigating further. Determined to find the killer and bring him to justice, Evan decides to form a neighborhood watch. However, he only manages to recruit Bob (Vince Vaughn), a construction worker and loving father; Franklin (Jonah Hill), a high school dropout who dreams of being a police officer but failed the written, physical, and mental health tests; and Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), a recent divorcé.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} movement {{believes in}} a moral progression through reincarnation after death: the transmigration {{of the spirit}} in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation. The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's salvation. The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness. Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20th century, the street, {{along with}} nearby Brick Lane became the centre of the British Bangladeshi community. The East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road was opened by Shaykh Abdullah bin Subayl in 1985 and can {{accommodate}} over 3,000 worshippers, with dedicated facilities for women. The nearby London Muslim Centre opened in 2003. Whitechapel Market caters well for the community, with stalls stocking Asian fruit and vegetables including okra and mangoes, clothing such as tunics and pashminas, and mobile phone cards for cheap long-distance calls. A racially motivated attack on local worker Altab Ali near Whitechapel Road in May 1978 was a significant event for the local Asian community, and <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> now commemorated in Altab Ali Park at the western end of the road, which was built on the former St Mary's Church grounds.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E
