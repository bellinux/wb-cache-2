5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley of ashes on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E

25|$|Byzantine Armenia {{was already}} conquered in 638–639. Persian Armenia lay north of Azerbaijan. By now, except for Khurasan and Armenia, {{the whole of}} the Persian Empire was under Umar's control and Emperor Yazdegred III was on the run. However, Umar refused to take any chances; he never {{perceived}} the Persians as being weak and weary. The fact that Umar didn't underestimate the Persians <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> behind the brilliant and speedy conquest of the Persian Empire. Again Umar decided to send simultaneous expeditions to the far north-east and north-west of the Persian Empire. An expedition was sent to Khurasan in late 643 {{and at the same time}} an expedition was launched against Armenia.|$|E

25|$|Training {{methods are}} {{as varied as}} the pigeons themselves. Some fanciers believe their system <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> to their success and guard these hard learned lessons closely. Most fanciers will explain their basic {{strategy}} but some may be reluctant to share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning {{is one of the key}} elements in a lot of racing programs.|$|E

25|$|Elinor settles two {{thousand}} pounds on Mary, which Mary accepts. Elinor sells {{the house she}} inherited. Mary dies of morphine poisoning at an impromptu lunch at Hunterbury, as Elinor, at the house, and Mary with Nurse Hopkins, at the lodge, are clearing out private possessions. Everyone at the house {{had access to the}} morphine Nurse Hopkins claimed to lose at Hunterbury while Mrs Welman was ill. Elinor is arrested. Later, it is learned that her aunt died of morphine poisoning, after the body is exhumed. Peter Lord, in love with Elinor, brings Poirot into the case. Poirot speaks to everyone in the village. He uncovers a second suspect when Roddy tells him of the anonymous letter - the writer of that letter. Poirot then focuses on a few elements. Was the poison in the sandwiches made by Elinor, which all three ate, or in the tea prepared by Nurse Hopkins and drunk by Mary and Hopkins, but not by Elinor? What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b> of Mary's birth? Is there any significance in the scratch of a rose thorn on Hopkins's wrist? The denouement is revealed mainly in the court, as the defence lawyer brings witnesses who reveal what Poirot uncovers.|$|E
