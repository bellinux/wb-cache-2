500|$|Hayes {{tried to}} {{reconcile}} the social mores of the South with the recently passed civil rights laws by distributing patronage among southern Democrats. [...] "My task was {{to wipe out the}} color line, to abolish sectionalism, to end the war and bring peace," [...] he wrote in his diary. [...] "To do this, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country." [...] All of his efforts were in vain; Hayes failed to convince the South to accept the idea of racial equality and failed to convince Congress to appropriate funds to enforce the civil rights laws.|$|E
500|$|Hill met {{her partner}} as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a {{climbing}} trip in Moab, Utah, {{and at the}} age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, [...] "I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all about me and my experiences. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{had earlier}} had trials at Manchester United and Middlesbrough in 2002, and further trials at West Ham United and Rangers in 2004. Jones {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said [...] "It was hard because I'd just had my son and it was make it— or join the army. I had a family to support and at that time, it was either this is it... or I go into the services. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> for that life." [...] Jones began his professional career with Joe Public in his native Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. He soon moved to W Connection where he played for two years.|$|E
500|$|... "To Zion," [...] {{among the}} more introspective tracks on the album, spoke about how Hill's family comes before her career and her {{decision}} to have her first child, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy, so as to not conflict with her burgeoning career. In an interview she discussed the song's origin and significance, commenting [...] "Names wouldn't come when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to have him. The only name that came to me was Zion. I was like, 'is Zion {{too much of a}} weight to carry?' But this little boy, man. I would say he personally delivered me from my emotional and spiritual drought. He just replenished my newness. When he was born, I felt like I was born again." [...] She further stated: [...] "I wanted it to be a revolutionary song about a spiritual movement, and also about my spiritual change, going {{from one place to another}} because of my son." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2014 NBA draft, Frazier {{worked out}} for several NBA teams, {{including}} the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Philadelphia worked him out two times, and head coach Brett Brown invited him to play for them at the 2014 Las Vegas Summer League within an hour after he was not selected in the draft. The situation was {{compared to that of}} Khalif Wyatt, who played for the 76ers through the 2013 edition of the summer league, and attended Temple University in the Philadelphia area. Frazier said, [...] "When [...] reached out to me and said they wanted me for the summer league, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> to go for it. I just want to go out, have fun, play my hardest and show Philly and other teams what they can get from me.". According to the 76ers assistant coach, Chad Iske, he impressed the team's staff by his [...] "poise" [...] and experience at the higher level. At Las Vegas, Frazier averaged 3.4 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.2 steals in five games. On September 29, 2014, the Boston Celtics signed Frazier to a non-guaranteed training camp deal with the likely notion of auditioning with the Maine Red Claws in the future. On October 27, 2014, he was waived by the Celtics after appearing in four preseason games where he went 1-for-2 from the field and recorded two rebounds, four assists and four steals. As expected, four days later, he was acquired by the Maine Red Claws as an affiliate player. Frazier opened his season in the D-League by contributing 18 points, 9 assists, and 4 rebounds against the Oklahoma City Blue. He also shot 12-of-12 on free throws, helping the team win their first game.|$|E

He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called [...] "language gone on holiday." ...|$|E
