40|$|AbstractObjectivesCurrently, the {{incidence}} of scrub typhus has increased <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we described the epidemiological characteristics of scrub typhus cases reported <b>in</b> the <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> of Korea <b>in</b> 2009. MethodsWe analysed the case investigation reports of scrub typhus cases that were collected in Korea in 2009. Specially, the different risk factors such as fieldwork and outdoor activity were compared to <b>urban</b> and rural <b>areas,</b> and six <b>urban</b> cities. Statistical analysis was performed using χ 2 test. ResultsA total of 4, 461 cases (including 1, 663 suspected cases) were analysed in this study. Among these, the case reports of 4, 254 cases had complete addresses. The cases with outdoor activities were 720 (85. 2 %) <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>In</b> Daegu and Daejeon, {{the number of cases}} participated in outdoor activities was 32 (34. 4 %) and 23 (31. 5 %), respectively. <b>In</b> other <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> cases with outdoor activities were more than 85 %. ConclusionThe most common infection risk factor was outdoor activity <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> However, the proportion and distribution of outdoor activities were different <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> These results will be used to establish strategies for effective prevention and management <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|In Moldova (and likely Ukraine too, {{although}} {{statistics are}} not available here), the Bulgarians tend to use their native Bulgarian in rural areas, and Russian (instead of the majority language Romanian) in cities and towns. 53,178 or 80.99% of ethnic Bulgarians declared Bulgarian language as native (69.23% <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> and 90.55% <b>in</b> rural ones), 2,766 or 4.21% of them declared Romanian language as native (4.91% <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> and 3.64% <b>in</b> rural ones), 9,134 or 13.91% of them declared Russian language as native (25.08% <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> and 4.83% <b>in</b> rural ones), and 584 or 0.89% of them declared another language as native (0.78% <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> and 0.98% <b>in</b> rural ones).|$|R

2500|$|The {{number of}} women who attend school <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> vs. rural areas differs drastically. [...] <b>In</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> women's {{education}} is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> women <b>in</b> rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don’t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.|$|R

50|$|While there {{tended to}} be more singlewomen in {{northern}} Europe than in southern Europe, there were also more singlewomen in towns and cities than in the countryside. This phenomenon is likely {{due to the fact that}} there were more opportunities for female employment <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> Singlewomen may have been much more prevalent in cities because sex ratios were more equal in rural areas. As there {{tended to be}} more women than men <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> lifelong singlewomen were often more abundant <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
