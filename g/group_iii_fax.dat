The modem supported MNP5 data compression and their own format, CSP-3, which they claimed was as effective as v.42bis.

50|$|A typical (<b>Group</b> <b>III)</b> <b>fax</b> {{transmission}} {{requires a}} two-way conversation between two modems (that is, each participant must both transmit and receive). Each modem {{may be part}} of a “fax machine” incorporating an image scanner and a printer. A demodulator can only be used to observe a conversation between two fax modems, usually to record the image transmitted. It cannot be used to receive a fax transmission in the usual sense, because a sending modem cannot transmit an image without first negotiating a connection with a receiving modem.|$|E

40|$|The {{chloroplast}} {{genes of}} Euglena gracilis contain more than 60 group II and 47 <b>group</b> <b>III</b> introns. Some Euglena chloroplast genes also contain twintrons, introns-within-introns. Two types of twintrons have previously been described, a group II twintron and a mixed <b>group</b> II/group <b>III</b> twintron. We report that four introns, three within the RNA polymerase subunit gene rpoC 1 and one within ribosomal protein gene rpl 16, with mean lengths twice typical <b>group</b> <b>III</b> introns, {{are a new}} type of twintron. The <b>group</b> <b>III</b> twintrons are composed of <b>group</b> <b>III</b> introns within other <b>group</b> <b>III</b> introns. The splicing of the twintrons was analyzed by PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of cDNAs, and Northern hybridization. Excision of each <b>group</b> <b>III</b> twintron occurs by a two-step, sequential splicing pathway. Removal of the internal introns precedes excision of the external introns. Splicing of internal introns in three of the four <b>group</b> <b>III</b> twintrons involves multiple 5 '- and/or 3 '-splice sites. With two of the twintrons the proximal 5 '-splice site can be spliced to an internal 3 '-splice site, yielding alternative 'pseudo' fully spliced mRNAs. Excised <b>group</b> <b>III</b> introns of the rpl 16 twintron are not linear RNA molecules but either lariat or circular RNAs, probably a lariat. The origins of alternative splicing and a possible evolutionary relationship between <b>group</b> II, <b>group</b> <b>III</b> and nuclear pre-mRNA introns are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Frost {{tolerance}} {{was determined}} in Norwegian varieties of <b>groups</b> I and <b>III</b> of the psychrophihc fungus Typhula mhikanensis. When myceha of <b>group</b> I and <b>III</b> strains were rapidly frozen to - 40 ℃ {{in a program}} freezer at a cooling rate of 20 ℃/h, the regrowth of group I strains was delayed at their optimal growth temperature (10 ℃), whereas the regrowth of <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains was not affected at their optimal growth temperature (2 ℃). Furthermore, when <b>group</b> I and <b>III</b> strains were rapidly frozen and regrew at 0 ℃, the average temperature during snowfall in the northernmost area of Norway, group I strains, in contrast to <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains, did not regrow at all. These results suggest that <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains are more resistant than group I strains to rapid freezing <b>Group</b> <b>III</b> strains are well adapted to climatic conditions in northernmost Norway Freezing points of myceha of <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains were determined by calonmetenc analysis Mycelia of <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains froze at temperatures higher than - 10 ℃ Therefore, the freezing resistance of <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains might be based on extracellular ice formation. In the cytosol of <b>group</b> <b>III,</b> a 30 kDa protein that strongly immunoreacted with the anti-antifreeze protein (AFP) I antibody was found, and the 30 kDa protein level in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> strains was higher than that in group I strains.

40|$|Bee venom {{therapy has}} been used to treat immune-related {{diseases}} such as arthritis for a long time. Recently, it has revealed that <b>group</b> <b>III</b> secretory phospholipase A 2 from bee venom (bee venom <b>group</b> <b>III</b> sPLA 2) has in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory effects. A growing number of reports have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of bee venom <b>group</b> <b>III</b> sPLA 2. Notably, new experimental data have shown protective immune responses of bee venom <b>group</b> <b>III</b> sPLA 2 against a wide range of diseases including asthma, Parkinson’s disease, and drug-induced organ inflammation. It is critical to evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of bee venom <b>group</b> <b>III</b> sPLA 2 because this enzyme is known to be the major allergen of bee venom that can cause anaphylactic shock. For many decades, efforts have been made to avoid its adverse effects. At high concentrations, exposure to bee venom <b>group</b> <b>III</b> sPLA 2 can result in damage to cellular membranes and necrotic cell death.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To improve {{postoperative}} pulmonary reserve, we {{have employed}} parenchyma-sparing resections for central lung tumors irrespective of pulmonary function. The results of lobectomy, pneumonectomy, and sleeve resection were analyzed retrospectively. METHODS: From October 1995 to June 1999, 422 typical lung resections were performed for lung cancer. Of these, 301 were lobectomies (group I), 81 were sleeve resections (group II), and 40 were pneumonectomies (<b>group</b> <b>III).</b> RESULTS: Operative mortality was 2 % in group I, 1. 2 % in group II, and 7. 5 % in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> (<b>group</b> I and II vs. <b>group</b> <b>III,</b> p< 0. 03). Mean time of intubation was 1. 0 +/- 4. 1 days in group I, 0. 9 +/- 1. 3 days in group II, and 3. 6 +/- 11. 2 days in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> (<b>groups</b> I and II vs. <b>group</b> <b>III,</b> p< 0. 01). The incidence of bronchial complications was 1. 3 % in group I, none in group II, and 7. 5 % in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> (<b>group</b> I and II vs <b>group</b> <b>III,</b> p< 0. 001). After 2 years, survival was 64 % in group I, 61. 9 % in group II, and 56. 1 % in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> (p = NS). Freedom from local disease recurrence was 92. 1 % in group I, 95. 7 % in group II, and 90. 9 % in <b>group</b> <b>III</b> after 2 years (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Sleeve resection {{is a useful}} surgical option {{for the treatment of}} central lung tumors, thus avoiding pneumonectomy with its associated risks. Morbidity, early mortality, long-term survival, and recurrence of disease after sleeve resection are similar to those seen after lobectomy...|$|R
