40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to {{investigate}} the procedure for decrease of the two-degree-of-freedom <b>floated</b> <b>gyro.</b> The regularity of influencing dynamic heating processes on the service availability time has been discovered. The mathematical models of heating and angular drift speed at linear acceleration action have been developed. The methods for determination of T* 00 p* 00 l and also methods for compensation of the temperature and heat drift speed have been developed; the workstation has been made.

40|$|The paper compares and {{describes}} {{the advantages of}} dry tuned <b>gyros</b> over <b>floated</b> <b>gyros</b> for space applications. Attention is given to describing the Teledyne SDG- 5 gyro and the second-generation NASA Standard Dry Rotor Inertial Reference Unit (DRIRU II). Certain tests which were conducted to evaluate the SDG- 5 and DRIRU II for specific mission requirements are outlined, and their results are compared with published test results on other gyro types. Performance advantages are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of appearance of additional errors of <b>float</b> two-sedate <b>gyro</b> is analytically described at casual character {{of angular motion}} of fuselage of aircraft and penetrable acoustic radiation. The mechanical impedance of anti-symmetric constituent of sound-wave is assumed far less a symmetric constituent. ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??? ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????. ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ????????????...|$|R
40|$|The Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) used in NASA's Orbiting Astronomical Observatory uses three single {{degree of}} freedom, <b>floated,</b> rate-integrating <b>gyros</b> {{operated}} in binary, pulse-restrained torque loops {{to provide an}} inertial attitude reference for the spacecraft's attitude control system. The drift rates observed on these inertial grade gyros during the 1 1 / 2 year of in-orbit operation have remained within a band of 16 arcsec per hour peak-to-peak. When the effects of known disturbances are considered, the standard deviation of drift rate appears to approach one arcsec per hour. Included in this paper are {{a brief description of}} the OAO and IRU, a summary of the data reduction programs used to calibrate the IRU in orbit, and some thoughts on how gyros with good long-term drift stability could be applied to future spacecraft such as the Large Space Telescope and Earth Observatory Satellite...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamically}} tuned gyro (DTG) {{was developed}} to replace the <b>floated,</b> rate integrating <b>gyro</b> used for space attitude control, as the DTG fulfills cost, performance, and reliability requirements not satisfied by its predecessor. The use of this gyro in the Dry Gyro Inertial Reference Unit I (DRIRU I) marked the first application of a DTG in a spacecraft attitude reference unit. Design and performance characteristics of DTG application in the Singer-Kearfott Inertial Reference Unit (SKIRU) are outlined, for example its minimal weight (7 lb), and operational reliability. The DTG has accomplished 156, 000 failure-free hours, and a chart, logging test performance, indicates that this and other requirements were more than sufficiently satisfied. The unit has an unparalleled life span, with several units still operating after 70, 000 to 130, 000 hours, and a random drift which always remains under 0. 0005 deg/h. Potential for improvements, such as drift performance, are considered...|$|R
