5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> now part of investigations. OPP noted that the <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police.

5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more readily accessible source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

5|$|After Cofresí's death, items {{associated}} with him have been preserved or placed on display. His birth certificate is at San Miguel Arcángel Church {{with those of}} other notable figures, including Ramón Emeterio Betances and Salvador Brau. Earrings said to have been worn by Cofresi were owned by Ynocencia Ramírez de Arellano, a maternal cousin. Her great-great-grandson, collector Teodoro Vidal Santoni, gave them to the National Museum of American History in 1997 and the institution displayed them in a section devoted to Spanish colonial history. Locally, <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture's General Archive of Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, the University of Puerto Rico's General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church's Parochial Archives.

5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 1815, {{three months}} after his father's death, Cofresí married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arcángel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> unclear about her birthplace; {{although}} it is also listed as Curaçao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofresí's father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofresí owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germán, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Matías) who died soon after birth.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E
5|$|Upon his arrival, Bond is {{contacted}} by Aki, {{assistant to the}} head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger Tanaka, while watching sumo. Aki introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate.

Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato.
