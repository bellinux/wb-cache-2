500|$|TV Fanatic {{said the}} episode {{was not as}} strong as {{previous}} seasons, but an improvement over [...] "Sexual Healing".

However, O'Neal praised the satire of people looking too deeply into the meaning of meaningless art, and how easily that theme can be applied to South Park itself. Not all reviews were entirely positive. Ramsey Isler of IGN said Butters was [...] "awesome, as usual", and thought the jokes about the Kardashians were funny, but that the positive elements of the episode were [...] "not enough to balance out the failures".
