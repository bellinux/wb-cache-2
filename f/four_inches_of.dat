25|$|I have had, in {{the last}} four years, the advantage, if it be an advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from which the student of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was so thrilling as this: to wait and {{struggle}} among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine—poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all—the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realisation of powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair—all this for seventy minutes by the clock with only <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> twisted iron work to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one hand—safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.|$|E
500|$|As scout cruisers, {{the ships}} were only lightly {{protected}} to maximise their speed. They had a curved protective deck that was [...] thick {{on the slope}} and [...] on the flat. Their conning tower was protected by <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> armour.|$|E

500|$|The {{waterline}} armour belt of Mikasa {{consisted of}} Krupp cemented armour {{that had a}} maximum thickness of [...] over {{the middle of the}} ship. It was only [...] thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six-inch strake of armour that ran between the barbettes. The barbettes were [...] thick, but reduced to six inches {{at the level of the}} lower deck. The armour of the barbette hoods had a thickness of [...] The casemates protecting the secondary armament were [...] thick and the deck armour was [...] in thickness. The forward conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour, but the aft conning tower only had <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> armour.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Kent {{returned}} to Chatham and underwent a major refit, {{which included a}} [...] Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms {{as well as the}} dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended [...] down from the lower deck. <b>Four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments. The ship's aft director was moved to a pedestal [...] the searchlight tower that replaced the original aft control station. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower. The changes raised the ship's displacement by [...] and cost an estimated £161,000. Unlike her sister ships, no aircraft hangar was added because that would have pushed her over the Washington Naval Treaty limits, but her catapult was replaced with a more powerful one capable of handling the heavier Supermarine Walrus flying boat.|$|E
500|$|As Rafael {{exited the}} northeastern Caribbean Sea, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on October14. This watch was subsequently upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning the following morning, but was dropped by early on October17 as the system passed northeast of the island. In advance of the system, residents were urged to take their typical precautionary measures; in addition, the main two airlines on Bermuda—WestJet and United Airlines—cancelled hundreds of flights on October16. Officials warned of minor storm surge along low-lying coasts, while the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) warned of two to <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> rainfall. Winds, while stronger than locals expected, did not cause significant damage. The BWS noted that sustained winds of , and gusts reaching , occurred at the L.F.

500|$|In July 1936, Cornwall {{returned}} home to begin a major refit, which included a [...] Krupp cemented armour belt abreast the engine and boiler rooms {{as well as the}} dynamo room and the fire control transmitting station. This belt extended [...] down from the lower deck. <b>Four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> armour were also added to protect the sides of the boiler room fan compartments. A hangar for her aircraft was added and a new, more powerful catapult was installed. The ship's director was moved to the roof of the hangar and a new power-operated director-control tower was installed in its original location. Her single four-inch AA guns were replaced with twin-gun mounts for Mark XVI guns of the same calibre. Two octuple-barrel 2-pounder mounts were added abreast the searchlight tower and the original 2-pounder guns were removed. The changes raised the ship's displacement by [...] and cost an estimated £215,000. After the refit was completed in December 1937, the ship was assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron before rejoining the 5th CS in 1939.|$|E
500|$|In {{some ways}} the armour {{protection}} given to the Indefatigables was weaker than that of their predecessors as the armour was reduced in thickness {{in a number of}} places, but it was spread out to a greater extent. The main belt ran from stem to stern; it was [...] thick for the middle [...] of the ship, but was reduced to [...] abreast the end 12-inch gun barbettes and magazines and thinned still further to [...] at the ends of the ship. A [...] bulkhead met the barbette of X turret while the forward bulkhead was [...] in thickness. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by [...] of armour, except for the turret roofs which used [...] of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The supporting beams for the turret roofs were reinforced over those of the Invincibles based on lessons learned in firing trials conducted during 1907. The thickness of the main deck was generally [...] of nickel steel, but increased to [...] {{around the base of the}} barbettes. The lower deck armour of nickel steel was [...] on the flat and 2inches thick on the slope, but increased to two inches at the ship's ends. The sides of the forward conning tower were [...] thick while the spotting tower had four inches. The roof and floor of both towers were KNC armour 3inches thick while the conning tower's communication tube was <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> KNC. The torpedo director tower 1inch of nickel steel all around. Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. The funnel uptakes were protected with 1.5inches of nickel steel on the sides and 1inch on the ends. Krupp cemented armour was used throughout, unless otherwise mentioned.|$|E

2500|$|Governor Connally also reacted {{after the}} same bullet {{penetrated}} his back just below his right armpit. The bullet created an oval entry wound, impacted and destroyed <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> his right fifth rib, and exited his chest just below his right nipple. This created a two-and-a-half inch oval sucking-air chest wound. That same bullet then entered his arm just above his right wrist and cleanly shattered his right radius bone into eight pieces. The bullet exited {{just below the}} wrist at the inner side of his right palm and finally lodged in his left inner thigh. The Warren Commission theorized that the [...] "single bullet" [...] (see single-bullet theory) struck sometime between Zapruder frames 210 to 225, while the House Select Committee theorized that it struck exactly at Zapruder frame 190.|$|E
2500|$|Honan {{was born}} in Utica, New York, the son of William Francis Honan, a {{thoracic}} surgeon of Irish descent, and Annette Neudecker Honan, a journalist of English descent. His brother was the journalist William Honan, who became culture editor of The New York Times. His father died in 1935, when Honan was seven years old, leaving his mother to raise their sons alone; she rented a small house in Bronxville, New York, where she felt the public schools were excellent. He earned a scholarship to Deep Springs College, a small school in the California desert. While at school, Honan worked as a butcher and a car mechanic, enjoying horseback riding and fascinated with the local reptiles. Of the butcher job, he said: [...] "My boots used to be awash in <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> blood in the slaughterhouse. That helped to make me a pacifist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Governor Connally {{was also}} {{struck by the}} shots, and his wife pulled him closer to her. [...] He {{suffered}} several severe wounds that he survived; a bullet entry wound in his upper right back located just behind his right armpit; <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> his right, fifth chest rib was pulverised; a two-and-a-half inch sized chest exit wound; his right arm's wrist bone was fractured into seven pieces; {{and he had a}} bullet entry wound in his left inner thigh. Although there is controversy about exactly when he was wounded, analysts from both the Warren Commission (1964) and House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979) believed that his wounds had been inflicted nearly simultaneously with President Kennedy's in their theories that the two men were struck by a single bullet. The Commission theorized both men were hit nearly simultaneously between Zapruder film frames 210 to 225, while the Committee theorized it happened at frame 190.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Goode was {{acknowledged}} as [...] "the proprietor during {{the heyday of}} the 'Springs Tour'." [...] He was a medical doctor trained in Philadelphia and Edinburgh.

If you could hide in the {{forecastle}} during the night you might cut away all the top underneath the tarpaulin and prop it up, so that if anyone trod {{on it in the}} morning they would not notice what had been done. Then when they have pushed off you could knock away the props, the board would tumble down, and there would be only the tarpaulin cover on the sides. It would float then quite <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> out <b>of</b> the water, and that {{in the middle of the}} stream would look almost level with it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In , Williams {{was playing}} in his eighth All-Star Game. In the first inning, Williams caught a [...] line drive by Ralph Kiner, {{slamming}} into the Comiskey Park scoreboard and breaking his left arm. Williams played {{the rest of the}} game, and he even singled in a run to give the American League the lead in the fifth inning, but by that time Williams' arm was a [...] "balloon" [...] and he was in great pain, so he left the game. Both of the doctors who X-rayed Williams held little hope for a full recovery. The doctors operated on Williams for two hours. When Williams took his cast off, he could only extend the arm to within <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> his right arm. Williams only played 89 games in 1950. After the baseball season, Williams' elbow hurt so much he considered retirement, since he thought he {{would never be able to}} hit again. Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox owner, then sent Jack Fadden to Williams' Florida home to talk to Williams. Williams later thanked Fadden for saving his career.|$|E
2500|$|Near fall: Near fall {{points are}} similar to the points awarded for {{exposure}} or the danger position in the international styles of wrestling, but the emphasis for near falls is on control, not risk. Near fall criteria are met when: (1) the offensive wrestler holds the defensive wrestler in a high bridge or on both elbows; (2) the offensive wrestler holds any part of both his opponent's shoulders or scapulae (shoulder blades) within <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> the mat; or (3) the offensive wrestler controls the defensive wrestler {{in such a way that}} one of the bottom wrestler's shoulders or scapulae, or the head, is touching the mat, and the other shoulder or scapula is held at an angle of 45 degrees or less to the mat. The referee counts the seconds off. Only one near fall is scored for a wrestler using the same pinning combination, regardless of the number of times the offensive wrestler places the defensive wrestler in a near fall position during the situation. Near fall points are also known as [...] "back points." [...] Much of the criteria for the near fall were used in a former scoring opportunity known as predicament in collegiate wrestling. When near fall points are given after the opponent is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively, it is a consequence of what is sometimes referred to as the scream rule.|$|E

60|$|Fresh-water Fishes.--The {{only other}} {{vertebrates}} in the Seychelles are two fresh-water fishes abounding in the streams and rivulets. One, Haplochilus playfairii is peculiar to the islands, {{but there are}} allied species in Madagascar. It is a pretty little fish about <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> long, <b>of</b> an olive colour, with rows of red spots, and is very abundant {{in some of the}} mountain streams. The fishes of this genus, as I am informed by Dr. Günther, often inhabit both sea and fresh water, so that their migration from {434} Madagascar to the Seychelles and subsequent modification, offers no difficulty. The other species is Fundulus orthonotus, found also on the east coast of Africa; and as both belong to the same family--Cyprinodontidæ--this may possibly have migrated in a similar manner.|$|R
50|$|The Lunar {{landscape}} exterior {{was constructed}} by Jack Poplin {{and his team}} on Soundstage #2 at KTTV and the moon backdrops were from M.G.M. The jagged mountains and rock columns were placed so as to hide the gaps in these backdrops. The moon surface itself was a <b>four</b> <b>inch</b> deep layer <b>of</b> sand that had been dyed different colours to give the moonscape different gradations of tone when filmed in black and white. Paintings by astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell were used as background plates for sequences of the two Moonstones moving over the lunar surface.|$|R
50|$|The second mast fell {{during an}} ice storm which hit the area on April 6, 1997, {{subjecting}} it to wind gusts of 70 mph and causing at least <b>four</b> <b>inches</b> (100 mm) <b>of</b> ice to accumulate on the structure, {{resulting in the}} structure's failure at 6:09 P.M..
