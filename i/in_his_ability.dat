5|$|One such {{solution}} is by bidding: Players take turns bidding {{on how many}} moves it will take them to win the game. The lowest bidder gets the king. Thus, one player may open with a bid of 15turns, the other player may counter with a bid of 14turns, and the first player, more confident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to escape in 13rounds than <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to contain for 14, may bid 13 and take the king's side. If that player does not escape within 13turns, the other player wins. Another workaround is to play a two-round match, in which players switch sides after the first round. If the king escapes both rounds, the winner is the player whose king escaped in the fewest turns.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was confident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} another {{significant}} difference in Napoleon himself, {{in the way he}} holds himself. David's Napoleon is flamboyant, confident in his leadership of the French army, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 1956, outside Satara, India, the car {{in which}} Baba was being driven went {{out of control and}} a second serious {{automobile}} accident occurred. Baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries. Dr. Nilu, one of Baba's mandali, was killed. This collision seriously incapacitated Baba. Despite his physicians' predictions to the contrary, after great effort Baba managed to walk again, but from that point on he was in constant pain and was severely limited <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to move. In fact, during his trip to the West in 1958 he often needed to be carried from venue to venue.|$|E
5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus.

5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Although Bonaparte had not {{expected}} British interference in his operations against Egypt, the Royal Navy had responded to the reports of French mobilisation on the south coast by despatching a small squadron to the Ligurian Sea under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Arriving on 21 May, Nelson's squadron {{was struck by a}} severe storm and was forced to make hasty repairs off Sardinia. The storm had also dispersed the squadron's frigates, leaving Nelson with only three ships of the line. Although he was reinforced by another ten ships of the line and a fourth rate on 7 June, he still lacked any scouts and was thus severely hampered <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to search for information on French operations. The detached frigates had been scattered across the Western Mediterranean, and were unable to locate either the British or the French fleets. Reinforcements sent by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent at the Tagus River suffered from the same problem, the frigates spreading out widely in their search but failing to discover either of the main British or French forces, which were rapidly sailing southeastwards towards Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His {{efforts to}} mediate between {{his mother and}} the Breckinridges {{extended}} his visit and after he contracted influenza, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa's colder climate. While at home, he met Bullock's cousin, Mary Cyrene Burch, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas's cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in Georgetown, Kentucky. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), Clifton Rodes (b. 1846; later a Congressman from Arkansas), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850) and Mary Desha (b. 1854). Gaining confidence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> as a lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator James B. Beck.|$|E

In pursuing Nate, however, Blair herself cheats on her new boyfriend Pete, which results in her losing both of them. She eventually begins to acknowledge her mistakes, with her father's help. She later grows closer to Chuck Bass (which initially occurred in the series' television adaptation), who she'd previously known for years, which leads them to briefly date one another.|$|E

5|$|New {{polls in}} January {{indicated}} voter support was growing for Toomey, who now held a projected nine percentage point lead over Specter and an eight-point lead over Sestak. Specter continued to lead against Sestak in the Democratic primary poll, {{this time by}} a 21-point margin. Some political scientists believed Toomey's gain over Specter {{could be attributed to}} voter distrust of establishment candidates and growing dissatisfaction with the health care proposal pending in Congress. However, some Democratic leaders felt Sestak's challenge to Specter was having a detrimental effect not only to Specter, but to the Democratic party in general and their prospects for ultimately winning the general election. This feeling was enhanced by the growing national support for the Republican party, and especially by the unexpected victory of the Tea Party-backed Republican Scott Brown in a special election for a traditionally Democratic Massachusetts Senate seat. Specter acknowledged to The New York Times that the national political mood might work against him in the primary, but insisted he was not discouraged and expressed confidence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to survive.|$|E

As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting very effectively, but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E

A loss of form against India (2004) resulted in Taufeeq losing his place in the team and a subsequent loss of batting confidence.|$|E

25|$|Anderson throws four pitches for strikes: a fastball, a curve, a changeup and a slider. His fastball {{sits in the}} 89-92mph {{range and}} he offers a two-seam variety in {{addition}} to the traditional four-seam version. His best pitch is the slider, a two-plane breaking ball he can paint on the corner versus right-handed batters and sweep away from lefties in the 79-81mph range. His low-to-mid 70s curveball is a weapon in any count and his 82-84mph changeup has shown the most improvement as Anderson has fought his way through injuries. Over the course of his career, Anderson's arm slot has lowered slightly, dropping from high three-quarters to true three-quarters. He's athletic and repeats his mechanics, aiding <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> to command his entire arsenal.|$|E

Because Surrey apparently saw considerable potential in him, Lockwood spent two years qualifying by residence. He began to play for Surrey in 1889 and immediately showed that Surrey's belief <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> as a batsman was justified, scoring a then-highly respectable 384 runs in 1889 and in 1890 he averaged 24 for over 500 runs, in the process scoring a maiden first-class hundred against Yorkshire at the Oval (ironically Surrey lost the match).|$|E
