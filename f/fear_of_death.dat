5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify immortality. The dichotomy of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>Death.</b> Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E

25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E

25|$|According to the indictment, {{the detainees}} were, among other things, {{subjected}} to physical violence, constant humiliation, degradation, inhumane conditions, and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Severe beatings were commonplace. All manner of weapons were used during these beatings, including wooden batons, metal rods, baseball bats, lengths of thick industrial cable that had metal balls {{affixed to the}} end, rifle butts, and knives. The killings, beatings, sexual assaults, and other cruel and humiliating actions were committed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the quality}} of Atma is {{primarily}} consciousness, all sentient and insentient beings are pervaded by Atma, including plants, animals, humans and gods. The difference between them is the contracted or expanded state of that consciousness. For example, animals and humans share in common the desire to live, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> desire to procreate and to protect their families and territory {{and the need for}} sleep, but animals' consciousness is more contracted and has less possibility to expand than does human consciousness.|$|E
25|$|This, Kleist's last play, {{met with}} {{resistance}} {{not only from}} his contemporaries. The <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> scene was long held to be unperformable and was always omitted. Equally criticised were the prince's sleep-walking and the trick played by the Elector. This was because although these were things that were acceptable in comedy, they offended the rules governing the portrayed behaviour of the aristocratic figures of tragedy. This was a convention that really only disappeared shortly before the First World War, when it did become possible to portray an aristocrat as a figure of comedy, for example Baron Ochs in Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Der Rosenkavalier.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} problem of {{variability}} <b>of</b> defenses from <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and their dependence on the obtained profession. We describe a study with the sample was 757 subjects 18 - 25 years old (398 males, 359 females) from Moscow (N. E. Bauman Moscow State Technical University, engineers, n = 283), Cheboksary (Chuvash State University, physicians, psychologists, and Cheboksary Branch of RSSU, lawyers, managers, n = 323), and Odessa (Odessa National University of Economics, economists, n = 151). During the study, the subjects filled in questionnaires on time-perspective, hardiness, <b>death</b> attitudes and <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The study confirmed the hypothesis that medical students {{in relation to the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>death</b> are significantly different from non-health professions students in relation to the problem <b>of</b> <b>death</b> ana pattern <b>of</b> defenses. The article presents a comprehensive picture of each of the professions of the students enrolled in the study, considering the heightened risk of suicide.

25|$|Like most archetypical villains, Voldemort's arrogance {{leads to}} his downfall. He also {{suffers from a}} {{pathological}} <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness. However, while he had many traits of a megalomaniac, {{he did not have}} all, as one common trait associated with megalomania and narcissists was shifting blame. Voldemort admitted he paid an expensive price in attacking the parents of Harry Potter, and carefully studied what went wrong when reorganizing his Death Eaters, ultimately placing the blame upon himself. According to Rowling, his Boggart would be his own corpse. Rowling also said that the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry accepts mortality, and thus Harry is in the end stronger than his nemesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose to}} do shava sadhana varies {{from person to}} person. An aim of shava sadhana is to unite the Kundalini with Param Shiva. From a yogic or Tantric point of view, it signifies {{detachment}} from the physical world, and uniting with the Absolute, identified with the male god Shiva, the Divine Mother Shakti or the abstract Brahman. The detachment leads to freedom from Samsara (the cycle of birth, death and reincarnation) and the adept goes beyond the orthodox concepts of purity and impurity; auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. The ritual is done using a corpse, considered a highly impure and inauspicious symbol in traditional Hinduism. Since it deals with directly encountering death, it is believed to lead to non-death, symbolized by longevity, wealth and power. The ritual is said to erase the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from the practitioner's mind. It may be also be conducted to placate a personal deity. For Aghoris, the purpose is not spiritual, but simply to acquire the skull for rituals or gain power over {{the soul of the}} deceased so that he can act as a medium to other spirits or acquire powers to control them. Andre Padoux interprets shava sadhana as black magic which is done to accomplish evil motives.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{did this}} {{incident}} do either Amy or me much service, for, the danger being over, the <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> vanished with it; ay, and our <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> what was beyond death also.

So certain {{is it that the}} repentance which is brought about by the mere apprehensions <b>of</b> <b>death</b> wears off as those apprehensions wear off, and deathbed repentance, or storm repentance, which is much the same, is seldom true.|$|R

25|$|After Morgoth's defeat, his {{lieutenant}} Sauron gradually rallied many of Morgoth's {{servants to}} his own cause, and during the Second Age established himself {{in the land of}} Mordor. Sauron lacked the raw power and malice of his master, but he seduced many to his allegiance with lies and false promises. In the Second Age, Sauron repeatedly used his fame among Men as Morgoth's erstwhile lieutenant to portray himself as Morgoth's representative and thus gain the allegiance of his former master's worshippers. Similarly, in Númenor following his capture, Sauron became very powerful by seducing Ar-Pharazôn to the worship of Melkor, establishing a Cult in which it was only natural that, as Melkor's foremost former disciple, he became high priest. This cult exploited the Númenórean <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> by claiming that human sacrifice to Melkor would grant the Men of Númenor immortality. In actuality, by turning away from Eru and the Valar they only dwindled more rapidly. Sauron used this religion among his means of encouraging Ar-Pharazôn's invasion of Valinor, which resulted in the destruction of Númenor by Eru. By the Third Age Sauron came more often to propound himself, rather than Morgoth, as the object of worship for his servants and subjects, but in his pride also portrayed himself as Morgoth returned when it was more convenient for him to do so.|$|E
25|$|For instance, theft {{is defined}} in section 378 of the Code, and section 379 makes simple theft (or theft simpliciter) an offence {{punishable}} with imprisonment of {{up to three years}} or with fine or both. Section 379A punishes the theft of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle with imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years and a fine. Sections 380 and 381 respectively make it offences to commit theft in any building, tent or vessel which is used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property; and, while being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, to commit theft of any property in the possession of one's master or employer. In both cases the penalty is imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine. The most serious theft offence is that of committing theft, having made preparation for causing death or hurt or restraint, or <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> or of hurt or of restraint, to any person in order to commit the theft, or in order to effect an escape after committing the theft, or in order to retain property taken by the theft. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to ten years and caning with not less than three strokes.|$|E
