This position is called the neutral point.

5000|$|A <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> or tailplane, usually {{mounted at}} the tail near the {{vertical}} <b>stabilizer.</b> The <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is used to stabilize the plane's pitch (tilt up or down) and mounts the elevators which provide pitch control.|$|R
40|$|A Schweizer 1 - 36 {{sailplane}} {{was modified}} for a controlled, deep-stall flight program. This modification allowed the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> to pivot {{as much as}} 70 deg leading edge down. Ground vibration and flutter testing were accomplished on the sailplane with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in the normal flight and deep-stall flight positions. Test results indicated satisfactory damping levels and trends for the structural modes of the sailplane. The modified sailplane was demonstrated {{to be free of}} aeroelastic instabilities to 83 KEAS with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in the normal flight position and to 39 KEAS with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in the deep-stall flight position. This flight envelope was adequate for the controlled, deep-stall flight experiments...|$|R

The application of the method to a T-tail of interest shows the expected trends. A strip theory correction scheme is proposed to permit separation and factoring of CLα and Clβ on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> by different factors.

40|$|In {{a never-ending}} quest for {{reducing}} aircraft weight, an attempt {{is made to}} decrease {{the size of the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of a jet transport {{through the use of a}} stability augmentation system. This work explores the feasibility of reducing the size of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of large transport jets while still maintaining good handling characteristics in the longitudinal mode. The dynamic equations of motion are employed to study the response of an aircraft to various size reductions of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> At the same time, a stability augmentation system is designed to ensure that the aircraft remains stable during flight on exposure to various destabilizing factors...|$|R

50|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> usually {{creates a}} {{downward}} force which balances the nose down moment {{created by the}} wing lift force, which typically applies at a point (the wing center of lift) situated aft of the airplane's center of gravity.

50|$|A variable-position <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{changes the}} pitch {{simultaneously}} with the flaperon setting.Normally the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{also known as}} tailplane is fixed and has a hinged elevator, a stabilator is another method that combines the functions of an elevator and a horizontal stabilizer.The variable-position <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is governed by the flaperon setting: the settings of the flaperon control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer angle of incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed {{in relation to the}} flaperon requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing trim drag.Flaperon settings are used to optimize the lift and drag of a wing. When the flight requires low speed the flaperons are in a positive position and when the flight requires high speed flaperons are in a negative position.|$|R
