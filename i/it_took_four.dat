5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> {{months for}} reports of Heber's death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an {{appropriate}} memorial; this idea {{was taken over}} by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul's Cathedral, London. More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> and a half years.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a semi-automatic rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> {{years until}} they reunited, {{when she and}} Agrippa came to Rome in 75. The reasons for this long absence are unclear, but {{have been linked to}} {{possible}} opposition to her presence by Gaius Licinius Mucianus, a political ally of emperor Vespasian who died sometime between 72 and 78. Agrippa was given the rank of praetor, while Berenice resumed her relationship with Titus, living with him at the palace and reportedly acting in every respect as his wife. The ancient historian Cassius Dio writes that Berenice was at the height of her power during this time, and if it can be any indication as to how influential she was, Quintilian records an anecdote in his Institutio Oratoria where, to his astonishment, he found himself pleading a case on Berenice's behalf where she herself presided as the judge. The Roman populace however perceived the Eastern Queen as an intrusive outsider, and when the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus caved in to the pressure and sent her away.|$|E

5|$|By mid-September 2015, {{the global}} stock of highway legal plug-in {{electric}} passenger cars and utility vans reached the one million sales milestone. Sales of plug-in electric vehicles achieved the one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 achieved the one million unit milestone in September 2016. The global stock of plug-in hybrid cars totaled almost 800,000 units at the end of 2016.|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} years, {{the city was}} known as a {{deliberate}} reminder of an expression in the Qur'an, when it refers to Paradise. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> years to build (764–768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists {{from around the world to}} come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city. July was chosen as the starting time because two astrologers, Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah, believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, Leo. Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.|$|E
25|$|A week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini {{died from}} {{internal}} hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored {{association with the}} devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> years and {{an appeal to the}} Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist František Ondříček persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.|$|E

25|$|The west tunnel was {{the most}} {{difficult}} of the three tunnels to excavate. It was excavated using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) that took over four years to bore its way through the mountain. The TBM was launched from the Waterman Portal and tunneled in a westerly direction toward the Devil Canyon portal at a slight uphill gradient of approximately 2inches per 100 linear feet (0.17%). Crews faced many challenges during the excavation, including the 2003 Old Fire that destroyed construction equipment at the Waterman Portal and halted tunneling for ten days. Later that year, a flash flood engulfed the Waterman Portal site and submerged the TBM. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> months to restore operations {{in the aftermath of the}} flooding.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{committee}} proposed an independent investigation {{board for the}} maritime sector, either {{as part of the}} Norwegian Maritime Authority or as an independent agency subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. During the political discussions a joint board was favored instead. Parliament approved the new jurisdiction in 2004. However, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>four</b> years to implement the decision, and nine years from the conclusions of {{the committee}} were presented. The delays were caused by the legal implications and complexity of the investigations. Because the board was only to investigate from a safety point of view, a new legal and administrative framework had to be implemented to ensure that the Norwegian Police Service take over the responsibility for criminal investigation of the marine accidents.|$|E
25|$|In 968, the Fatimids {{were led}} by General Jawhar al-Siqilli with his Kutama army, to {{establish}} a new capital for the Fatimid dynasty.

During that time, Jawhar also commissioned the construction of the al-Azhar Mosque, which developed into the third-oldest university in the world. Cairo would eventually become a centre of learning, with the library of Cairo containing hundreds of thousands of books.
