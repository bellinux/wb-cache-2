500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the <b>formed</b> <b>steel</b> technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual spot welds. [...] In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E

It is demonstrated that better properties are achieved. The interpretation of the mechanisms of deformation during tensile testing indicate that the ductility can be further enhanced without compromising strength.

This paper studies the effect of the variation of microstructure and heat treatment process in the heating process of 22 MnB 5 hot <b>forming</b> <b>steel</b> with Zn plating layer on coating microstructure and properties. The microstructure and morphology of 22 MnB 5 with zinc based coatings by different pre-alloying and austenitizing technology are analyzed by SEM, EDS, and glow spectrum analyzer. The results show that under the same pre-alloying time, with the temperature improved, the coating's phases change from ζ phase, δ phase, Γ 1 phase and Γ phase to mainly Γ phase; under the same temperature, as the pre-alloying process time goes by, the contents of Fe gradually increases but Zn decreases, finally the Fe content could reach 88 %, and Zn reaches 8 % in the coating; the coating is almost all α-Fe (Zn) with only a small amount of Γ phase on the surface, and the thickness of the coating is about 12 μm; high quality coatings could be obtained under the pre-alloying process of heating at 550 ℃ for 30 min and austenitizing at 920 ℃ for 4 min.

40|$|Abstract — The {{study of}} {{connections}} in any structure is of primary importance because, {{it is always}} desirable the structural member to fail first instead of the connection. If the structural connection fails before {{the failure of the}} member it is always a brittle failure and catastrophic. Present study is focused out to determine the structural performances of various beam–columns with bolted moment connections on cold <b>formed</b> light gauge <b>steel</b> sections by analytical, FEM analysis and experimental tests. The analysis included four types of beam column connections with gusset plate. The number of bolts required for basic connection are determined from BS 5950 - 5 1998. Based on proposed four types of connection configuration, they are modeled in pro-e. Further, this modeled connection is analyzed in hypermesh, then experimental test have been carried out on the same connections. The relations between moment-rotation, moment resistance, model factor and various modes of failure were observed. From the experimental and FEM analysis it has been observed that there is always torsional buckling failure of beam section and distortion of gusset plate and from result model factor of proposed model is 0. 731 and moment resistance of connection archives 32 % to that of moment resistance of cold <b>form</b> <b>steel</b> section.
