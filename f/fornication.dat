5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, <b>fornication,</b> pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from <b>fornication</b> to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E
5|$|The {{main unit}} of local {{government}} was the parish, and since it was {{also part of the}} church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including <b>fornication,</b> drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords ("lairds") and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parish's discipline. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in most places by the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{existed in}} China since ancient times, {{although}} during the Han dynasty {{the proportion of}} slaves to the overall population was roughly 1%, far lower than the estimate for the contemporary Greco-Roman world (estimated at about 15% of the entire population). During the Tang period slaves {{were not allowed to}} marry a commoner's daughter, were not allowed to have sexual relations with any female member of their master's family, and although <b>fornication</b> with female slaves was forbidden in the Tang code of law it was widely practiced. Manumission was also permitted when a slave woman gave birth to her master's son, which allowed for her elevation to the legal status of a commoner, yet she could only live as a concubine and not as the wife of her former master.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, <b>fornication</b> and sodomy, it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{appointed}} to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look less like a defeat for the archbishop. Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard. There was no attempt at an election by the monks, a lack which went against canon law. During his tenure of office, his monks accused him of <b>fornication,</b> excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating monastic property for his own use. A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic habit prescribed by the Benedictine Rule. All these charges come from one of his monks, the historian Thomas of Marlborough, who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham. Thomas's account of Norreis's rule is biased against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes. Norreis did manage some good for the abbey, as it was while he was abbot that the crossing tower of the monastic church was completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{punishment}} for <b>fornication</b> that goes against nature. cxvj. When a human commits <b>fornication</b> with a beast, {{a man with}} a man, a woman with a woman, they have also forfeited life. And they should be, according to the common custom, banished by fire from life into death.|$|E
25|$|Catholicism ties <b>fornication</b> with {{breaking}} the sixth commandment in its Catechism.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is one of}} few industrialized {{countries}} to have laws criminalizing adultery. In the United States, laws {{vary from state to}} state. Up until the mid 20th century most U.S. states (especially Southern and Northeastern states) had laws against <b>fornication,</b> adultery or cohabitation. These laws have gradually been abolished or struck down by courts as unconstitutional. Pennsylvania abolished its <b>fornication</b> and adultery laws in 1973.|$|E
25|$|In Martin v. Ziherl, the Supreme Court of Virginia {{ruled the}} state's <b>fornication</b> law unconstitutional relying on Lawrence {{and the right}} to privacy.|$|E
25|$|Lower courts {{decided that}} because the Commonwealth's Attorney doesn't prosecute <b>fornication</b> cases {{and no one had}} been prosecuted for <b>fornication</b> {{anywhere}} in Virginia in over 100 years, Martin had no risk of prosecution and thus lacked standing to challenge the statute. Martin appealed. Since Martin had something to lose - the ability to sue Ziherl for damages - if the statute is upheld, she had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute even though the possibility of her being prosecuted for violating it was zero. Since the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence has found that there is a privacy right in one's private, noncommercial sexual practices, the Virginia Supreme Court decided that the statute against <b>fornication</b> was unconstitutional. The finding gave Martin standing to sue Ziherl since the decision in Zysk was no longer applicable.|$|E
25|$|In Afghanistan, Dubai, Morocco and Pakistan, {{some women}} who made accusations of rape {{have been charged}} with <b>fornication</b> or adultery. This law was amended in Pakistan in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Others {{involved}} the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Bush v. Kentucky (1883) reversed convictions because of racial exclusion {{in the jury}} system. In Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Court upheld an adultery prohibition that punished inter-racial <b>fornication</b> more than same-race <b>fornication.</b> Pace was overruled by McLaughlin v. Florida (1964). Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) struck down a discretionary laundry permitting system that disadvantaged Asians. Hayes v. Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute authorizing the prosecution more peremptory challenges in large cities.|$|E

25|$|Pontesbury was replaced, but in 1522, his successor, Christopher Hunt, {{was accused}} of <b>fornication,</b> as well as {{incompetence}} and negligence. He admitted the <b>fornication</b> but claimed he had already performed penance. Nevertheless, {{he was sent to}} Lilleshall Abbey to be disciplined, and it was said he was much improved on his return. However, Hunt managed to get the abbey into debt by Â£100, a considerable feat considering its excellent revenues and low running costs. Between 1527 and 1529, he disappeared from the scene and was replaced by Thomas Corveser, who had been his chaplain and one of his sternest critics. Corveser seems to have restored the abbey's finances and reputation. He remained abbot until the dissolution.|$|E
25|$|Scalia {{wrote that}} if the court was not {{prepared}} to validate laws based on moral choices as it had done in Bowers, state laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, <b>fornication,</b> bestiality, and obscenity would not prove sustainable.|$|E
25|$|The Testament of Benjamin is {{very much}} an {{appendix}} to that of Joseph. It opens with the account Joseph gave Benjamin of how he was sold to the Ishmaelites. He exhorts his descendants against deceit, but, as all his brethren, he warns them against <b>fornication.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{crime for}} which the protagonist faces hanging is {{occasionally}} mentioned. The woman may be being held for ransom by pirates, or she has stolen something from her employer. Other instances tell of her having lost a treasured golden ball or indicate that she is being hanged for <b>fornication.</b>|$|E
25|$|Typically {{defining}} miscegenation as a felony, {{these laws}} prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons {{of different races}} and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes, the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of adultery or <b>fornication</b> would be brought against them instead.|$|E
25|$|Beherit {{was formed}} in 1989 by three young musicians from Rovaniemi, Lapland; vocalist and guitarist Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance (Marko Laiho), bassist Daemon <b>Fornication</b> and drummer Sodomatic Slaughter (Jari Pirinen). The band {{released}} three demos the following year; Seventh Blasphemy, Morbid Rehearsals and Demonomancy, and also gathered reputation for their live shows, which included pig heads and goats on stage.|$|E
25|$|Whether these lists include {{homosexuality}} {{depends on}} the translation of porneia (sexual impurity). Translations of these passages generally translate porneia as <b>fornication</b> rather than sexual impurity (see Leviticus). Some interpret the translation of porneia more broadly, to encompass sexual immorality in general, though there is disagreement over whether such an interpretation {{is supported by the}} writings of the Church Fathers.|$|E
25|$|The Testament of Reuben is {{predominantly}} concerned with admonishing lust, and the sinfulness of Reuben in his having {{had sex with}} Bilhah, a concubine of his father. It {{is likely that the}} author wished to cover the topic of <b>fornication</b> anyway, and assigned it for Reuben to discuss due to Reuben's relationship with Bilhah being recounted in the canonical Bible.|$|E
25|$|A confession, an oath, or {{the oral}} {{testimony}} of Muslim witnesses {{are the main}} evidence admissible, in sharia courts, for hudud crimes, that is the religious crimes of adultery, <b>fornication,</b> rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, apostasy, drinking intoxicants and theft. Testimony must be from at least two free Muslim male witnesses, or one Muslim male and two Muslim females, who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character. Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, <b>fornication</b> or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some fiqhs allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male. Forensic evidence (i.e., fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other circumstantial evidence is likewise rejected in hudud cases in favor of eyewitnesses, a practice which can cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases.|$|E
25|$|Like Jovinian, Pelagians {{insisted that}} human {{affections}} and desires were not {{touched by the}} fall either. Immorality, e.g. <b>fornication,</b> is exclusively a matter of will, i.e. a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained {{it as one of}} the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.|$|E

25|$|Whereas some doubts {{have arisen}} whether {{children}} got by any Englishman upon a Negro woman should be slave or free, be it therefore enacted and declared by this present Grand Assembly, {{that all children}} born in this country shall be held bond or free only according to {{the condition of the}} mother; and that if any Christian shall commit <b>fornication</b> with a Negro man or woman, he or she so offending shall pay double the fines imposed by the former act.|$|E
25|$|Zina is an Islamic {{legal term}} {{referring}} to unlawful sexual intercourse. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina can include adultery (of married parties), <b>fornication</b> (of unmarried parties), prostitution, bestiality, {{and according to}} some scholars, rape. The Quran disapproved of the promiscuity prevailing in Arabia at the time, and several verses refer to unlawful sexual intercourse, including one that prescribes the punishment of 100 lashes for fornicators. Zina thus belong to the class of hadd (pl. hudud) crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.|$|E
25|$|The Testament of Judah is {{primarily}} concerned with courage, monetary greed, and <b>fornication.</b> It begins by portraying Judah as idealistically courageous, involving bravery in front of wild beasts, as well as successful military expeditions, sometimes basing the narrative on acts that the canonical bible attributes to Jacob. However, {{it goes on to}} present a xenophobic focus, criticising his marriage to a non-Israelite, as well as his sexual activity with Tamar, his daughter-in-law who at that time was pretending to be a prostitute.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} in the Jewish Encyclopedia, great as was the success of Barnabas and Paul in the heathen world, the {{authorities}} in Jerusalem insisted upon circumcision as the condition of admission of members into the church, until, on the initiative of Peter, and of James, the head of the Jerusalem church, it was agreed that acceptance of the Noachian Laws â namely, regarding avoidance of idolatry, <b>fornication,</b> and the eating of flesh cut from a living animal â should be demanded of the heathen desirous of entering the Church.|$|E
25|$|Sharia {{was perhaps}} most famous for {{calling for the}} {{abolition}} of interest-bearing banks, hadd penalties such as flogging and amputation for alcohol consumption, theft, <b>fornication,</b> adultery and other crimes. Hadd penalties have been criticized by Westernized Muslims as cruel and in violation of international human rights but Maududi argued that any cruelty was far outweighed by the cruelty in the West that resulted from the absence of these punishments, {{and in any case}} would not be applied until Muslims fully understood the teachings of their faith and lived in an Islamic state.|$|E
25|$|Under English law {{effective}} {{during the}} {{ratification of the}} U.S. Constitution, including the Treason Act 1351, there were essentially five species of treason. Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or imagining) {{the death of the}} king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally <b>fornication</b> with women in the royal family of the sort which could call into question the parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause.|$|E
25|$|We {{call you}} to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of <b>fornication,</b> homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with {{interest}} (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.|$|E
25|$|Zina is an Islamic law, both in {{the four}} schools of Sunni fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and the two schools of Shi'a fiqh, {{concerning}} unlawful sexual relations between Muslims who are not married to one another through a Nikah. It includes extramarital sex and premarital sex, such as adultery (consensual sexual relations outside marriage), <b>fornication</b> (consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons), illegal sex by a slave girl, and homosexuality (consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners). Traditionally, a married or unmarried Muslim male could have sex outside marriage with a non-Muslim slave girl, with or without her consent, and such sex was not considered zina.|$|E
25|$|Hudud is an Islamic concept: punishments which under Islamic law (Shariah) are {{mandated}} {{and fixed}} by God. The Shariah divided offenses into those against God and those against man. Crimes against God violated His Hudud, or 'boundaries'. These punishments were {{specified by the}} Quran, {{and in some instances}} by the Sunnah. They are namely for adultery, <b>fornication,</b> homosexuality, illegal sex by a slave girl, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to present four male Muslim eyewitnesses, apostasy, consuming intoxicants, outrage (e.g. rebellion against the lawful Caliph, other forms of mischief against the Muslim state, or highway robbery), robbery and theft. The crimes against hudud cannot be pardoned by the victim or by the state, and the punishments must be carried out in public.|$|E
25|$|Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings {{and deeds}} from {{those close to}} him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with {{different}} writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways. Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or <b>fornication</b> or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and {{an increasing number of}} Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority of Shiite interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.|$|E
