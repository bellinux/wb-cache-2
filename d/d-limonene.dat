500|$|It {{has been}} known since the late 17th century that plants contain [...] {{chemicals}} which are avoided by insects.

The flowers of Chrysanthemum species contain pyrethrin which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in agriculture and plant breeding, particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of pesticides. The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by Vincent Dethier and G.S. Fraenkel.

2500|$|The dextro-form, S-(+)-carvone is {{obtained}} practically pure by the fractional distillation of caraway oil.

Carvone may be synthetically prepared from limonene via limonene nitrosochloride which may be formed by treatment of limonene with isoamyl nitrite in glacial acetic acid. This compound is then converted into carvoxime, which can be achieved by refluxing with DMF in isopropanol. Refluxing [...] carvoxime with 5% oxalic acid yields carvone.

40|$|Although limited, {{observations}} from cell culture, animal, and epidemiological studies support {{the presence of}} anti-cancer properties in citrus peel and the primary bioactive food constituent, <b>d-limonene.</b> Early evidence from animal models suggests that when ingested, <b>d-limonene</b> exhibits {{a wide spectrum of}} biologic activity including chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects.
