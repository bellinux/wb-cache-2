25|$|I {{arranged}} {{meetings with}} my young friends, {{some of whom}} were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
500|$|Austrian School {{economist}} Friedrich Hayek was Keynes's {{most prominent}} contemporary critic, with sharply opposing {{views on the}} economy. Yet after Keynes's death, he wrote: [...] "He was the one really great man I ever knew, and <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> had unbounded admiration. The world {{will be a very}} much poorer place without him." ...|$|E

When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|At one point, Thompson {{was asked}} by the National Institute on Media and the Family to stop invoking the organization's name in his campaigns. NIMF {{president}} David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name.

I {{will make a}} book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod." [...] He altered the text to read, [...] "I have made many books about well-behaved people." [...] Potter responded:If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal too much afraid of the public, <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> have never cared one tuppenny-button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly good, because it gets away from [...] "once upon a time".|$|E
500|$|McCain had {{stated in}} mid-February that [...] "I hate the gooks", in {{reference}} to his captors during the Vietnam War. [...] This use gained some media attention in California, which had a large Asian American population. [...] After criticism from some in that community, McCain vowed to no longer use the term, saying, [...] "I will continue to condemn those who unfairly mistreated us. But out of respect to {{a great number of}} people <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> hold in very high regard, I will no longer use the term that has caused such discomfort." [...] Reaction among Vietnamese Americans to McCain's use of this term was mixed although supportive of McCain himself, [...] and exit polls in the primary in California showed that they strongly supported him. [...] This was not the first or the last example of controversial remarks by McCain.|$|E
500|$|Austen {{wrote in}} her first {{surviving}} letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was [...] "very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man". She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most {{did not make}} the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned; others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of Hessian troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel's aide-de-camp, and was sent under escort to Marlborough. The Duke welcomed the French commander – [...] "I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> have the highest regard." [...] With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her {{daughter}} Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family. PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I {{do not know how to}} tell what was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 years, my fatherland and not to find anyone <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> cared." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E

500|$|Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship, in January 1922. He had {{received}} a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: [...] "about the best {{of any of the}} Candidates in the group". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable—"not at all the kind of don <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> had been prepared by stories of Jowett." [...] The first recorded clash between them came early in Waugh's first term; {{in a letter to his}} school friend Dudley Carew, Waugh reports that his tutor verbally abused him for a Latin mistranslation with the words [...] "Damn you, you're a scholar!" [...] The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Whereas Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study, Waugh considered it a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. To the detriment of his work, Waugh involved himself in a range of university activities: the Oxford Union, the Hertford debating society, journalism and drawings for the undergraduate papers Isis and Cherwell, and a hectic social life. In his third term, he was brusquely advised by Cruttwell that he should take his studies more seriously, a warning which Waugh chose to interpret as an insult. [...] "I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable", he later wrote.|$|E

In the terms of underground music...that's nearly impossible, with so many bands worthy of attention falling {{on and off the}} radar nearly daily. Not that this particular band needs any help, but with years and years of taunting new releases, new music, and then shooting them down, it became a game of [...] "band who cried album." ...|$|E

The award was accepted on his behalf by Jacques Tits, who said in his address: [...] "I cannot but express my deep disappointment—no doubt shared by many people here—in the absence of Margulis from this ceremony. In view of the symbolic meaning of this city of Helsinki, I had indeed grounds to hope that I would have a chance at last to meet a mathematician whom I know only through his work and <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> have the greatest respect and admiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{inscription}} in Syracuse {{dedicated to}} Euskia mentioning St Lucy's Day {{as a local}} feast {{dates back to the}} 4th century A.D., which states [...] "Euskia, the irreproachable, lived a good and pure life for about 25 years, died on my Saint Lucy's feast day, she <b>for</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> cannot find appropriate words of praise: she was a Christian, faithful, perfection itself, full of thankfulness and gratitude". The Feast of Saint Lucy became a universal feast of the Church in the [...] 6th century, commemorating the Christian martyr's death on 13 December 304 A.D. St. Lucy's Day appears in the sacramentary of Gregory, {{as well as that of}} Bede, and Christian churches were dedicated to Saint Lucy in Italy as well as in England.|$|E
