5|$|Certain {{other members}} of the royal family wear {{distinctive}} robes, most particularly queens consort (including dowagers) and princesses of the United Kingdom, all of whom wear purple velvet mantles edged with <b>ermine</b> over their court dresses. Other {{members of the royal family}} in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that royal dukes wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of <b>ermine</b> on the cape and additional <b>ermine</b> on miniver edging to the front of the robe.|$|E

It comprises an embroidered <b>ermine</b> cape with a train of purple silk velvet, trimmed with Canadian <b>ermine</b> and fully lined with pure silk English satin. The purple recalls the imperial robes of Roman Emperors.|$|E

5|$|The helm {{on which}} the crest was borne was {{originally}} a simple steel design, sometimes with gold embellishments. In the reign of Elizabeth I a pattern of helm unique to the Royal Arms was introduced. This is a gold helm with a barred visor, facing the viewer. The decorative mantling (a stylised cloth cloak that hangs from the helm) was originally of red cloth lined with <b>ermine,</b> but was altered to cloth of gold lined <b>ermine</b> by Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|Cremations {{dated to}} the middle Saxon period have been {{discovered}} near the junction of High Dyke with Chapel Lane.

5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto <b>Ermine</b> Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very {{important}} at that time, probably the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along <b>Ermine</b> Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, Alice and {{the three}} younger of her sisters were granted use of the royal arms, with an inescutcheon of the shield of Saxony, {{representing}} her father. The shield is differenced by a label argent of three points, demonstrating {{that she is the}} child of a monarch; the outer points bore an <b>ermine</b> spot each, and the centre bore a rose gules, to differentiate her from other members of the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lepidoptera utilise {{the leaves of}} {{ailanthus}} as food, including the Indian moon moth (Actias selene) and the common grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). In North America the tree is the host plant for the ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea), though this <b>ermine</b> moth is native to Central and South America and originally used {{other members of the}} mostly tropical Simaroubaceae as its hosts. In its native range A. altissima is associated with at least 32 species of arthropods and 13 species of fungi.|$|E

The arms were not granted or authorised by the College of Arms, but the length of time for which they have been used has given them a prescriptive authority.|$|E

5|$|A Bronze Age {{cemetery}} and {{the remains of}} an Iron Age settlement have been discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman <b>Ermine</b> Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have been}} {{captured}} live for fur farming, zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920–1946, pelt prices averaged about $137 CAN. Since pelts were relatively valuable, {{attempts were made}} to raise fishers on farms. Fur farming was popular with other species such as mink and <b>ermine,</b> so it was thought that the same techniques could be applied to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In general, knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter {{has the highest}} divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the <b>ermine,</b> polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.|$|E

50|$|It is {{not known}} today what the supporters—an Elephant <b>Ermines</b> eared Argent tusked Or {{collared}} and lined Or and a Beaver Vert its tail barry wavy Azure and Argent ducally gorged and lined Or—were meant to symbolize. Both of the beasts also appear {{in the arms of}} families associated with the city's history. The tincture of the elephant is <b>ermines,</b> a fur which can also be called counter-ermine. The crown around the neck of the beaver is a duke's coronet.|$|R
5|$|Queen Elizabeth's {{coat of arms}} was {{the royal}} coat of arms of the United Kingdom (in either the English or the Scottish version) impaled with the arms of her father, the Earl of Strathmore; the latter being: 1st and 4th quarters, Argent, a lion rampant Azure, armed and langued Gules, within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (Lyon); 2nd and 3rd quarters, <b>Ermine,</b> three bows {{stringed}} paleways proper (Bowes). The shield is surmounted by the imperial crown, {{and supported by the}} crowned lion of England and a lion rampant per fess Or and Gules.|$|E
5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use <b>ermine,</b> to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E
5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an <b>ermine</b> cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E
40|$|Helminths are {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from <b>ermines</b> (Mustela erminea) and martens (Martes americana) in Washington, USA. Among 22 adult <b>ermines,</b> 41 % were infected by one or more of five species (Taenia mustelae, Alaria mustelae, Molineus patens, M. mustelae, and Trichinella spiralis). Among 78 adult martens from three geographic localities, the prevalence was 83 %. Nine species were identified (Mesocestoides sp., T. mustelae and T. martis americana, Euryhelmis squamula, M. patens, Baylisascaris devosi, Physaloptera sp., Soboliphyme baturini, and T. spiralis). Trichinella spiralis occurred with a maximum prevalence of 50 % in martens, but only occurred in 9 % of <b>ermines.</b> Compression and digestion techniques provided a similar estimate of prevalence of T. spiralis, yet neither was entirely accurate in identifying all infected hosts. The species richness of the helminth community of martens in Washington was greater than that reported from other regions of North America...|$|R
