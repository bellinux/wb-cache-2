2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{flung the}} bridle of her horse round the veranda post, and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> tie it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> {{feed the}} animals, and tether them, and loose their bells for the night, and carry the packs under cover.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{saw the two}} {{coming up}} the path, and wanted to learn if she were not one of them. Can <b>I</b> <b>help</b> disliking <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> think of the past? Can <b>I</b> <b>help</b> {{watching}} <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> remember my boy? Can <b>I</b> <b>help</b> ill-wishing <b>her</b> if <b>I</b> well-wish him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that won't kill anybody," [...] replied her hostess. [...] "Don't hurry. Carrie, {{take the}} baby out to the wagon for Mrs. Markham while <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> with her things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Celia, {{thinking}} it was very well for Sir James to say so, {{but he would not}} have been comfortable with Dodo. [...] "Shall I go to <b>her?</b> Could <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her,</b> do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> {{into the}} cab. [...] "Good-bye," [...] I {{said with a}} weak {{affectation}} of an everyday separation, and I turned to the cabman with her instructions.|$|E
6000|$|... "There! Now {{that shows}} she's makin' it all up!" [...] cried Statira. [...] "She {{put on a}} sack, and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> on with it myself. So there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I {{thought at}} the time, but <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> out, {{and a moment later}} a decided tapping {{on the top of the}} table {{announced}} the completion of the task.|$|E
60|$|We go {{rustling}} {{through the}} grass to the prostrate timber she has chosen. (I can remember even the thin bracelet on the wrist of the hand that lifted <b>her</b> skirt.) <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> to clamber into a comfortable fork from which her feet can swing....|$|R
60|$|JOHN.--I made a hass {{of myself}} about Miss Prior. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>help</b> <b>her</b> being l--l--lovely.|$|R
60|$|Dim {{pictures}} come to me. I see {{my mother}} at the spinning wheel, <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> fill the candle molds. I hold in my hands the queer carding combs with their crinkly teeth, but my first definite connected recollection is the scene of my father's return {{at the close of}} the war.|$|R
6000|$|... "She ain't my sister," [...] said Clarence quickly. [...] "She's {{a little}} girl. She's Mrs. Silsbee's little girl. We {{were in the}} wagon and got down. It's my fault. <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} very considerate, Miss Warren," [...] I whispered Mary, as <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to put on her shawl, [...] "in not betraying what I fancy is the most {{important}} of all Seneca's love secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} be kind to her always," [...] she faltered. [...] "We would have adopted her, {{but she would not}} stay here. She was unhappy, and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to escape. I had my reasons!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance {{at me as}} if <b>I</b> could <b>help</b> <b>her</b> wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} gone {{now more than}} half a year, but has sent no letter, no message, nothing to show that he still lives. Ottila waits, she writes, she grows too anxious to endure, she comes to look for him. <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her,</b> but we do not find him yet, and {{meantime}} I amuse her. My friends are kind, and we enjoy much as we look about us for this truant Adam." ...|$|R
60|$|LITTLE MAN. We {{got there}} {{just as the}} train was going to start; and I jumped, {{thinking}} <b>I</b> could <b>help</b> <b>her</b> up. But it moved too quickly, and--and left her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> buy {{a hat and}} {{a jacket}} {{at one of those}} nice shops just below the hotel where they're stopping, and we've started an evening dress for her. She can't wear that white duck morning, noon, and night." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} no great feeling of {{pleasure}} that I led the visitor into the house; {{and it is}} curious that as <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> down from the wagon something should recall Harry's warning: [...] "That fellow Fletcher will bring more trouble on you some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Lister awkwardly, [...] "I'd {{seen her}} {{look at her}} purse and frown, and as <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> up the {{locomotive}} steps I pushed a few bills into her hand. I don't think she knew they were paper money. She was highly-strung and anxious to get off before Shillito came along." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vent. Look, emperor, this is {{no common}} dew, [...] [Weeping. I have not wept this forty years; but now My mother comes afresh into my eyes; <b>I</b> cannot <b>help</b> <b>her</b> softness.|$|R
5000|$|Aunt. Nephew, {{have dinner}} with us, while <b>I</b> go and <b>help</b> <b>her</b> to undress ...|$|R
6000|$|VENTIDIUS. Look, emperor, this is {{no common}} dew. [...] [Weeping.] [...] I have not wept this forty years; but now [...] My mother comes afresh into my eyes; [...] <b>I</b> cannot <b>help</b> <b>her</b> softness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{continued}} {{to attend to}} a dairy long after my father married her,' pursued Stephen, without further hesitation. 'And I remember very well how, when I was very young, I {{used to go to}} the milking, look on at the skimming, sleep through the churning, and make believe <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her.</b> Ah, that was a happy time enough!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> {{out of the}} car, and we set off in silence. There was a {{suppressed}} {{excitement in}} my companion's manner which interested me, and something furtive which brought back all my old dislike of her. I could not imagine what she could {{have to say to}} me that had brought her all these miles.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} my watch. It was one o’clock. I had slept seven hours! And she had been {{steering}} seven hours! When I took the steering-oar I had first to unbend her cramped fingers. Her modicum of strength had been exhausted, and she was unable even to move from her position. I was compelled to let go the sheet while <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to the nest of blankets and chafed her hands and arms.|$|E
40|$|Most of us {{recall the}} first time we had English Language Learners (ELLs) in our classrooms. What does this child understand? How do <b>I</b> <b>help</b> <b>her</b> feel {{comfortable}} when I can’t communicate in the same language? How do I teach academic subjects and monitor progress when he doesn’t speak the language of instruction? How will her peers act toward her? These concerns are often coupled with a fear that spending valuable instructional time helping the ELLs may cause us to neglect the bulk of our class who are not ELLs...|$|R
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. It {{sounds to me like}} notoriety rather than fame. This poor child has a right to herself, and <b>I</b> will <b>help</b> <b>her</b> assert it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, mamma, may I {{go now to}} her. She said <b>I</b> could <b>help</b> <b>her</b> to say her prayers, and I {{think she}} only has little baby ones that her nurse taught her and she doesn't see into the Lord's Prayer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Andrew," [...] Duncombe said. [...] "She told me {{that she}} was not Phyllis Poynton. It was enough for me. I disregarded my convictions. Her word was my law. She said that she was not Phyllis Poynton, and to me she never was Phyllis Poynton. She was afraid of you, and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to avoid you. I admit it! It is the extent of my failing in our friendship, and you were warned." ...|$|E
60|$|Peggy and <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to dress. She {{insisted on}} wearing her best black silk, {{in which she}} looked unnaturally fine. Her soft muslin became her much better, but we could not induce her to wear it. Anything more prim and bandboxy than Aunt Olivia when her toilet was {{finished}} {{it has never been}} my lot to see. Peggy and I watched her as she went downstairs, her skirt held stiffly up all around her that it might not brush the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Coco {{must have}} fallen into the well last night," [...] she explained, as <b>I</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to the ground. [...] "I missed him at milking-time, and when I came to the well this morning I heard the most ear-splitting yowls coming up from it. I couldn't think where he could {{possibly}} be, for the water was quite calm, until I saw he had crept into a little crevice in the stones on the side. So I got a ladder and went down after him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wished to}} escape Aunt Maud. But {{he insists that}} it's through her and through her only that <b>I</b> may <b>help</b> him; just as Marian insists that it's through her, and through her only, that <b>I</b> can <b>help</b> <b>her.</b> That's what <b>I</b> mean," [...] she again explained, [...] "by their turning me back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apart--apart?" [...] said Miss Chancellor; [...] "when {{we shall}} all {{be looking to}} her, {{gathering}} about her, praying for her!" [...] There was an exceeding scorn in her voice. [...] "If <b>I</b> can <b>help</b> <b>her,</b> she shall be an immense power for good." ...|$|R
60|$|ENID. [Rising.] Oh! that's not true! {{the poor}} thing's heart---- What {{makes you look}} at me like that? <b>I</b> tried to <b>help</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
