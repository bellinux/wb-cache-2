A {{large number}} of column-bracing systems for the {{horizontal}} braces unlocated at middle of columns with <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>column</b> base were modeled and analyzed by second-order analysis using finite element method, in which the random combination of the initial imperfections between columns and horizontal braces was well considered by Monte Carlo method.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the different mechanical behavior of column-bracing system between fixed-ended and pin-ended column base, {{a large number of}} column-bracing systems with fixed-ended and pin-ended column base were studied using the ANSYS program, in which random combination of the initial imperfections between columns and braces was well considered by the Monte Carlo method. Based on the above comparative study, probability density function of the bracing force was found through probability statistics and the design bracing force is obtained. The results show that the ultimate load-carrying capacity and the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces of column-bracing systems with pin-ended column base are higher than that of column-bracing systems with <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>column</b> base, and the higher ultimate load-carrying capacity of the former more significantly increases the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces; that the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces in compression or in tension have also randomness because of the randomness of the initial imperfection of both columns and braces...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} fixed-ended aluminum alloy tubular columns of square and rectangular hollow sections {{is described in}} this paper. The <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>column</b> tests were conducted that included columns with both ends transversely welded to aluminum end plates using the {{tungsten inert gas welding}} method, and columns without welding of end plates. The specimens were extruded from aluminum alloy of 6061 -T 6 and 6063 -T 5. The failure modes included local buckling, flexural buckling, interaction of local and flexural buckling, as well as failure in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). An accurate finite element model (FEM) was developed. The initial local and overall geometric imperfections were incorporated in the model. The non-welded and welded material nonlinearities were considered in the analysis. The welded columns were modeled having different HAZ extension at the ends of the column of 25 and 30 mm. The nonlinear FEM was verified against experimental results. It is shown that the calibrated model provides accurate predictions of the experimental loads and failure modes of the tested columns. The load-shortening curves predicted by the finite element analysis are also compared with the test results. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a technique {{for determining the}} overall flexural and flexural-torsional bifurcation loads of locally buckled cold-formed channel columns. The method of analysis uses an inelastic geometric non-linear finite strip local buckling analysis to determine the flexural and torsional tangent rigidities of a locally buckled section. These tangent rigidities are substituted into the flexural and flexural-torsional bifurcation equations to calculate the inelastic overall buckling loads. The members {{are assumed to be}} geometrically perfect in the overall sense but can include geometric imperfections and yielding in the local mode. The bifurcation analysis is applied to cold-formed plain channel columns.

The edge stiffeners of the channel sections consisted of simple lips that inclined at different angles both outwards and inwards. Finite el ement analysis {{was used in the}} numerical investigation. A non-linear finite element model was developed and verified against <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>column</b> tests. Geometric and material non-linearities were included in the finite element model.

The column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design column strengths calculated using the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The design rules in the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for designing an edge-stiffened element are mainly based on tests of channels with simple edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges.

Two different cross-section geometries were tested at various lengths which involved pure local buckling, distortional buckling as well as overall flexural buckling and flexural-torsional buckling. The different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of fixed-ended and pin-ended channels are investigated by comparing strengths, load-shortening, load-deflection, load-end-rotation and load-end-moment curves, as well as longitudinal profiles of buckling deformations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of cold-formed steel channels with complex stiffeners subjected to pure axial compression for <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>columns.</b> The complex stiffeners {{of the channel}} sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated structural steel sheets. Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of column lengths. Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Design column curves are also plotted. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and intermediate columns, whereas the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all column lengths. This is because the Australian/New Zealand Standard has a separate check for distortional buckling of singly symmetric sections. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The columns are strengthened with carbon fibre sheets (CFS) glued at different outer surface locations (web, flanges and/or lips) and having fibres oriented either longitudinally or transversally - since the aim of the study is to assess the influence of the CFS on the column structural response, bare steel specimens were also analyzed. The numerical results, which consist of non-linear equilibrium paths (applied load vs. axial shortening) and ultimate strength values (most of them associated with local-plate or distortional failure mechanisms), are subsequently compared with experimental values obtained earlier. Finally, on the basis of both the numerical and experimental results, some relevant conclusions are drawn concerning the CFS location and fibre orientation that are most effective to strengthen lipped channel steel columns exhibiting either local-plate or distortional collapses. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of pin-ended channel columns, it is {{necessary}} to account for the shift of the effective centroid caused by local buckling. The current American Iron and Steel Institute's 1996 Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members and the 1996 Australian/New Zealand standard Cold-Formed Steel Structures calculate the shift by use of effective widths. However, the ability of the effective width rules to accurately predict this shift has not been experimentally assessed. In this paper, recent tests on <b>fixed-ended</b> channel <b>columns</b> are used to obtain values of the shift of the effective centroid, including its variation with the applied load. It is concluded that effective width rules of the American and Australian specifications accurately predict the direction and magnitude of the shift of the effective centroid for plain channels but not for lipped channels with slender flanges. The paper proposes simple modifications to the current effective width rules that provide agreement between the measured and predicted shifts of the effective centroid for lipped channels. The modifications are shown to produce more accurate design strengths for lipped channel columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work of this thesis sets out to give a clearer in-depth understanding of the failure mechanics of thin-walled compression members which are associated with complex interactions between the different buckling modes during the loading process. This thesis employs the finite element method {{in order to examine}} the effect of the modelling techniques imposed at the section junctions of short struts and to investigate the influence of the local and global end conditions with regard to support and loading on the compressive response of various sections, i. e. I-sections, plain channel sections, box-sections, and lipped channel sections. The thesis also details appropriate finite element modelling strategies and solution procedures taking due account of the influence of material nonlinearity and geometrical imperfections for the determination of the coupled mode interactive response of thin-walled compression members. A detailed account of the complete loading history of the compression members from the beginning of loading through to final collapse is given in the thesis. This involves elastic local buckling, nonlinear elastic and elasto-plastic post-buckling interaction behaviour and yield propagation leading to the development of an appropriate failure mechanism which causes final collapse and unloading. A new finite element modelling strategy has been developed in the thesis with particular reference to being able to deal with the classical assumption of the stress-free in-plane boundary conditions existing at the section junctions of short length strut members during post-local buckling. Also, for <b>fixed-ended</b> <b>columns,</b> with particular reference to singly-symmetric plain channel sections, {{it has been shown that}} column deflections are initiated from the onset of local buckling for the case of the constituent plate elements of the section being locally rotationally constrained at their ends. Such columns should not therefore be considered as an overall bifurcation problem of the locally buckled member. In the case of the pinned and fixed-ended boundary conditions of the columns, the finite element simulations are shown to be able to accurately describe the rather different complex failure mechanics with a high degree of imperfection sensitivity being shown to be in evidence for the pin-ended case. Considerably good agreement has been shown to occur with the independent simulations of other researchers using the finite strip method of analysis, with the analytical solution procedures of others and with the findings from independent test work and this has provided confidence in the viability and usefulness of the modelling strategies and solution procedures developed in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the behaviour and design of high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures using finite element analysis. In this study, equations predicting the yield strength and elastic modulus of high strength steel and mild steel at elevated temperatures are proposed. In addition, stress-strain curve model for high strength steel and mild steel materials at elevated temperatures is also proposed. The numerical analysis was performed on high strength steel columns over a range of column lengths for various temperatures. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results of columns at normal room and elevated temperatures. The effects of initial local and overall geometrical imperfections have been taken into consideration in the analysis. The material properties and stress-strain curves at elevated temperatures used in the finite element model were obtained from the proposed equations based on the material tests. Two series of box and I-section columns were studied using the finite element analysis to investigate the strength and behaviour of high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures. Both <b>fixed-ended</b> stub <b>columns</b> and pin-ended slender columns were considered. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, European and Australian specifications for hot-rolled steel columns at elevated temperatures by substituting the reduced material properties. In addition, the direct strength method, which was developed for the design of cold-formed steel columns at normal room temperature, was also used in this study to predict the high strength steel column strengths at elevated temperatures. The suitability of these design rules for high strength steel columns at elevated temperatures is assessed. Generally, it is shown that the American and European specifications as well as the direct strength method conservatively predicted the column strengths of high strength steel at elevated temperatures. The European Code predictions are slightly more conservative than the American Specification and the direct strength method predictions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Local {{buckling}} {{is a major}} {{consideration in}} the design of thin-walled cold-formed steel sections. The main effect of local buckling in plate elements under longitudinal compressive stresses is to cause a redistribution of the stresses in which the greatest portion of the load is carried near the supporting edges of the plate junctions. The redistribution produces increased stresses near the plate junctions and high bending stresses as a result of plate flexure, leading to ultimate loads below the squash load of the section. In singly symmetric cross-sections, the redistribution of longitudinal stress caused by local buckling also produces a shift of the line of action of internal force (shift of effective centroid). The fundamentally different effects of local buckling on the behaviour of pin-ended and <b>fixed-ended</b> singly symmetric <b>columns</b> lead to inconsistencies in traditional design approaches. The paper describes local buckling and shift of effective centroid of thin-walled cold-formed steel channel columns. Tests of channel columns have been described. The experimental local buckling loads were compared with the theoretical local buckling loads obtained using an elastic finite strip buckling analysis. The shift of the effective centroid was also compared with the shift predicted using the Australian/New Zealand and American specifications for cold-formed steel structures. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} and numerical investigation on the non-linear behaviour and load-carrying capacity of CFRP-strengthened cold-formed steel lipped channel columns, devoting special attention to their local-plate and/or distortional buckling behaviours. A preliminary GBT-based study concerning the column elastic buckling behaviour is performed, focusing on determining the (i) sheet location (web, flanges and/or lips) and (ii) carbon fibre orientation (longitudinal, transverse or inclined) that optimize the strengthening procedure (enhanced buckling behaviour vs. cost). Then, an experimental programme comprising a total of 19 short and long <b>fixed-ended</b> lipped channel <b>columns</b> is described. The columns were strengthened with carbon fibre sheets (CFS) bonded at different outer surface locations (web, flanges or lips) and having the fibres oriented either longitudinally or transversally - since the aim of the study is to assess the influence of the CFS on the column structural response, bare steel specimens were also tested. The experimental results, which consist of non-linear equilibrium paths (applied load vs. axial shortening) and ultimate strength values (most of them associated with local-plate and/or distortional failure mechanisms), are subsequently used to calibrate and validate geometrically and physically non-linear numerical analyses based on shell finite element models and carried out in the code Abaqus. Finally, on the basis of both the experimental and numerical results obtained, some relevant conclusions are drawn concerning the most effective CFS location and fibre orientation to strengthen lipped channel steel columns affected by local-plate and/or distortional buckling. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Envolto ao já conhecido comportamento de cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, questões aparentemente contraditórias tem sido reportadas em estudos experimentais de diversos autores, entre elas a ocorrência de modos de instabilidade em desacordo com aqueles obtidos via análise de estabilidade elástica, e forças axiais resistentes muito diferentes dos resultados teóricos (em geral, conservadoramente). Nestas condições, este trabalho procura analisar a fundo o comportamento das cantoneiras esbeltas de abas iguais, de modo a contribuir com o entendimento dos fenômenos que dificultam a interpretação dos resultados experimentais, dentre os quais, o afastamento {{longitudinal}} entre a rótula e a extremidade das barras (no caso de barras com extremidades rotuladas), e o sentido da imperfeição global de flexão em torno do eixo de menor inércia, o qual mostrou-se um fator chave na determinação do comportamento das cantoneiras, especialmente para comprimentos próximos da transição entre os dois modos globais de instabilidade elástica. Para esta faixa de comprimentos, diferentes níveis de interação entre os dois modos globais podem ser obtidos. Ademais, estudos experimentais realizados por diversos autores, aqui complementados por uma série de ensaios realizados em cantoneiras com extremidades engastadas, formam um vasto banco de resultados, que é utilizado para (além de comparações nos estudos teóricos) avaliar diversos procedimentos de previsão teórica sugeridos por diferentes autores, ou advindos de interpretações a partir do procedimento normativo, à luz do comportamento teórico estudado na primeira etapa do trabalho. Assim, destes procedimentos, apenas um baseado no Método da Resistência Direta, e dois baseados no Método das Larguras Efetivas demonstraram bons resultados, sendo que todos eles, desconsiderando o modo de flexo-torção como um modo global de instabilidade. Ao fim, comenta-se da necessidade de se expandir alguns estudos específicos, pois ao adotar-se um procedimento baseado somente no modo global de flexão, apesar de se mostrar estatisticamente mais eficiente, verifica-se a possível ocorrência de resultados demasiadamente contra a segurança. On {{the well}} known behavior of equal-leg angle columns, some questions apparently paradoxical {{have been reported}} in experimental results from several authors, including the occurrence of different instability modes from the expected by the elastic stability analysis, and maximum axial compressive load expressly different (generally conservative) from theoretical previsions. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the knowledge about the equal-leg angle columns behavior, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} features that complicate the interpretation of experimental results, among which, the longitudinal distance between the end sections and the center of hinges (pin-ended columns), and also the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection, which proved to play a key role in the post-critical column behavior, specially for column lengths near of the transition between global buckling modes (major-axis flexural-torsional and minor-axis flexural modes). On this range of lengths, different modal interaction amplitudes can be obtained, only with the direction of the minor-axis flexural initial imperfection (i. e., the amplitude of this imperfection plays a negligible influence on the column behavior). Furthermore, putting together a fairly large column ultimate strength data bank comprising experimental test results performed by several authors, collected from the available literature, and new experimental results on <b>fixed-ended</b> angle <b>columns</b> performed in this work, important comparisons with theoretical studies can be showed as well as evaluation of several ultimate strength theoretical prevision procedures, either those suggested by another authors as those arising from interpretations of normative procedures in the light of theoretical behavior verified in the first stage of labor. In conclusion, only one procedure based on Direct Strength Method and two procedures based on Effective Width Method exhibited accurate results, all of which neglecting the flexural-torsional mode as a global mode. Thus, it is important to mention that some additional studies are needed, because if adopted a procedure based only in the minor-axis flexural mode, despite being statistically advantageous, it is verified the possibility to occurs quite unconservative results...|$|R
