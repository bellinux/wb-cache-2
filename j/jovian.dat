5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the plasma into the co-rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the <b>Jovian</b> rotation to the kinetic energy of the plasma. In that sense, the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere is powered by the planet's rotation, whereas the Earth's magnetosphere is powered mainly by the solar wind.|$|E

50|$|In Conquest Earth, {{the player}} {{can choose to}} play as <b>Jovians,</b> aliens from Jupiter, or humans. Humans and <b>Jovians</b> have {{different}} menu layouts and tactics which they can employ for offensive and defensive actions. Also, the <b>Jovians</b> must deal with {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth, which obstructs their view, by using special troops; the humans also face a problem in the sulphur shrouds of Jupiter. The player can take direct control over any unit, or delegate control to commanders. The game has non-linear gameplay. The <b>Jovians</b> have several tactical maneuvers, including transforming into vehicles and other objects.|$|R
50|$|However, as {{the tour}} proceeds, the robots {{repeatedly}} (and unintentionally) surprise the <b>Jovians</b> with their immunity to extremes of heat, cold and radiation. Because they use gamma radiation for close range vision, they even pose {{a danger to}} local microbes and the <b>Jovians</b> themselves. At {{the conclusion of the}} tour the <b>Jovians</b> return the robots to their spacecraft, only to be astonished that it does not need to provide them with any protection against outer space. After a flurry of diplomatic activity, the <b>Jovians</b> return to the robots and, unexpectedly, swear eternal peace with humanity, surprising the robots. They quickly retreat back to Earth.|$|R

5|$|The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995–2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and {{discovered}} that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the <b>Jovian</b> magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three {{times larger than the}} magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the <b>Jovian</b> magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator, which should be compared with the <b>Jovian</b> magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the <b>Jovian</b> field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about ° from the <b>Jovian</b> magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the <b>Jovian</b> ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the <b>Jovian</b> rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the <b>Jovian</b> rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the <b>Jovian</b> ring system. Future missions to the <b>Jovian</b> system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E

50|$|On {{return from}} the surface of planet Jupiter, the three robots reflect on this change of heart by the <b>Jovians.</b> ZZ One (with his {{considerably}} lower reasoning capacity than the other robots) argues, {{from the perspective of the}} First Law, that the <b>Jovians</b> simply realized that they could not harm humans. However, the other two robots intuit the real reason. When the Jovians' superiority complex was confronted by the strength and resistance of the robots to all manner of hazards, it crumbled and led to their acquiescence. ZZ Three thoughtfully concludes that the <b>Jovians</b> had simply mistakenly assumed that the three robots were humans.|$|R
50|$|In All-Star Comics #55 Jupiter was {{the first}} planet to be invaded by a race of green-headed aliens, who {{threatened}} to destroy the <b>Jovians</b> unless they assisted them in conquering the Solar System's other planets.

5|$|When the Cassini {{spacecraft}} flew by Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo. New Horizons passed {{close to}} Jupiter in 2007, {{carrying out a}} unique investigation of the <b>Jovian</b> magnetotail, traveling as far as 2500RJ along its length. In July 2016 Juno was inserted into Jupiter orbit, its scientific objectives include exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. The coverage of Jupiter's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth's magnetic field. Further study is important to further understand the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere's dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it receives from the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of <b>Jovian</b> heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected from the planet (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire <b>Jovian</b> system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5000|$|Earth colonists on Ganymede, {{the largest}} {{satellite}} of Jupiter, {{have discovered the}} existence of intelligent life on the planet's surface. They manage to establish communication with the <b>Jovians</b> {{by means of a}} [...] "radio-click" [...] code, and exchange scientific information. When the <b>Jovians</b> realise that the humans are not like them, they break off communication with a threat to destroy what they see as inferior beings.|$|R

5000|$|A Conquest of Two Worlds by Edmond Hamilton (1932), {{published}} in Wonder Stories, reverses the usual kind of {{contact between the}} two worlds, with Earth launching a bloody colonial war against the primitive Martians for the planet's resources. Later in the story, they do the same on Jupiter. Martians and <b>Jovians</b> are never depicted as individuals, but several Earth military officers, including one who switches sides {{to fight for the}} <b>Jovians,</b> are.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the <b>Jovian</b> magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient <b>Jovian</b> field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field lines, which Io crosses, couple Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere by generating an electric current {{known as the}} Io flux tube. This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction darken the <b>Jovian</b> polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on <b>Jovian</b> radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help {{to shed light on}} these processes. The <b>Jovian</b> {{magnetic field}} lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath Io's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the <b>Jovian</b> system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric probe into the <b>Jovian</b> atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so.|$|E
50|$|Both stars {{also show}} RV-trends, which may {{indicate}} the presence of additional long-periodic <b>jovians</b> or brown dwarfs around each of them.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} timeline of the Gundam metaverse, space colonies were established near Jupiter {{in order to}} harvest the planet's helium 3 as a power source. Generations later, the colonists rebelled against Earth, forming a [...] "Jupiter Empire". All members referred to themselves as <b>Jovians,</b> and a select few even provoked their opponents by claiming that they were like sci-fi aliens, having been born apart from the human race on earth. The events of this war against the <b>Jovians</b> are depicted in the manga Crossbone Gundam.|$|R

5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner <b>Jovian</b> moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the <b>Jovian</b> system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but then gradually spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} <b>Jovian</b> aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the <b>Jovian</b> ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the <b>Jovian</b> aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009 a {{total of}} eight {{spacecraft}} have flown around Jupiter and all {{have contributed to the}} present knowledge of the <b>Jovian</b> magnetosphere.

Its twin Pioneer 11 visited Jupiter a year later, traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1.6RJ.|$|E
50|$|In Marvel Family #36 the Marvels go to Jupiter, which {{according}} to this story has gravity 300 times stronger than Earth (it actually has gravity nearly 2.3 times stronger).

50|$|As Nadesico progresses, we {{find that}} the very reason the <b>Jovians</b> (who are really humans) are attacking Earth is because they believe their cause to be just and that their path is the only true righteous one as they idolize the Gekiganger anime series.
