Legacy Effects {{co-owner}} Shane Mahan, known for creating the armored suits for Iron Man, was tasked with building the suits, helmets and conn-pods.

500|$|Post-production {{was handled}} by Montreal's Meteor Studios and <b>Hybride</b> Technologies {{filled in the}} bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 visual effects shots. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created a process dubbed [...] "The Crush," [...] which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were desaturated and tinted to establish different moods. Ghislain St-Pierre, who led the team of artists, described the effect: [...] "Everything looks realistic, {{but it has a}} kind of a gritty illustrative feel." [...] Various computer programs, including Maya, RenderMan and RealFlow, were used to create the [...] "spraying blood." [...] The post-production lasted for a year and was handled by a total of ten special effects companies.|$|E

The complex studying {{of the number of}} signs of species and some generations of the interspecies <b>hybrides</b> Drosophila group virilis has been performed, the number of specific characteristics for species has been revealed. It has been revealed that the importance of the adaptive characteristics depend on the distance separating the original species. The dependence of the dynamics of the polygeneous signs on the direction of interbreeding has been determined. The gradual forcing out of signs of the more young species from the <b>hybrides</b> genomes has been found.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a {{spontaneous}} mutation of sugar beet - pistillody has been detected with the monogenous type of heritability. It has been established, that {{the genes of}} the dialyfetus of the MS-plant are of the foreign origin and MS-numbers VNIISS not allelic. The unique diagram of using the sign of pistillody in the improvement of line O-type has been developed. The line 647 has been recorded {{as the source of}} pistillody.
