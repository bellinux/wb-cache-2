40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the possible layout configurations of <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> based on the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) technologies. SOFC/GT <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> have been investigated by using a plurality of approaches, such as: numerical simulations, experimental analyses, and thermo-economic optimizations. The majority of SOFC/GT hybrid systems are fed by methane, which is much cheaper and easier to manage than hydrogen. In fact, SOFC/GT systems use the capability of the fuel cell to internally perform the reforming process required to convert methane into hydrogen. The steam required to drive the reforming reaction can be supplied by the anode recirculated stream. Alternatively, such steam can be produced externally, by using the heat of the exhaust gases. In this case, steam can be used also for thermal purposes and/or for further system hybridization (e. g. Cheng cycle). The majority of the SOFC/GT <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> analyzed in literature are based on the pressurized arrangement, potentially able to ensure lower capital costs and higher efficiencies. Conversely, atmospheric plants are easier to manage, due to the possibility of operate the SOFC and the GT independently one of each other.
