40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{stressors}} of farm animals and their implications to animal productivity. Domestic animals are routinely faced with different stressors. Most stressful conditions, including cold, heat, handling, transporting, temperament, introduction to a new <b>flock,</b> <b>diseases</b> and parasites. Stress reduces the fitness and productivity of the of the animal. Little is known about the signs of stressed animal, in turn, almost all farmers lose their animals through death. Moreover, in the future population growth, urbanization and income growth in developing countries are fuelling massive global increase in demand for food of animal origin. However, the effects of stress has a great impact on the productivity of farm animals. It is imperative that the issue receive more research attention in minimizing farm animal stress and optimizing in product yield and quality...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterise the histopathological lesions and tissue tropism of Iranian isolate IR/ 773 / 2001 (793 /B) of avian {{infectious bronchitis}} virus in different organs of experimentally infected SPF chickens. Forty-two one-day-old, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks were divided randomly into two groups (21 chicks to each group). At the age of 12 days, one group was inoculated intra-ocularly with 10 3 EID 50 of the 793 /B isolate, and the other was kept as the control group. Tissue samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days post-inoculation (PI). The IBV virus was detected in the caecal tonsils and cloaca from the 2 nd to the 12 th day PI. The virus was also detected in the kidneys from days 4 – 10 PI and in the bursa of Fabricius from days 4 – 12 PI. The virus was detected in the trachea, lungs and thymus. The most obvious histopathological lesions were found in the trachea, kidney, lungs and bursa of Fabricius. Amongst the lymphoid tissues, histopathological changes were found most frequently in the bursa of Fabricius. The results of this study indicated that the 793 /B serotype of IBV is unlikely to cause mortality, severe clinical signs or gross lesions in infected chickens, but its replication in some tissues including the bursa of Fabricius could render birds susceptible to other micro-organisms. </p...|$|R

This {{study was designed}} to document the involvement of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) in this respiratory disease. Seventy six different chicken flocks with respiratory symptoms (48 broiler flocks, 21 layer flocks and 7 broiler-breeder flocks) were examined serologically by commercial MG ELISA kit and bacterial isolation for Mycoplasma. Twenty four MG isolates from 76 flocks were cloned and the presence of MG in the cloned cultures was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.

Multilevel logistic regression with poultry company as random effect was performed using the occurrence of necrotic enteritis in the farm's most recently reared flock as dependent variable. Strong associations were found between the outcome variable and the occurrence of wet litter (O. R. 2. 39; 95 % C. I. 1. 27 - 4. 52; p= 0. 007) and coccidiosis (O. R. 4. 68; 95 % C.

The dimensions of vulnerability considered were the sex and socio-economic status of the household head, and household morbidity and mortality. Data was collected from 11 key informants, four focus groups, 113 census households, 60 survey households and 10 case study households. Sex of the household head did not significantly affect small ruminant offtake but the trend was for more sheep offtake in male-headed households than female-headed households. Tangible sales and intangible savings and security benefits were of primary importance to all households. Socio-economic status of the household head significantly influenced the sale and slaughter of goats for consumption (P < 0. 05). Goat rearing was more market oriented than sheep rearing.

The <b>disease</b> is caused by an alphaherpesvirus, the Marek’s disease virus (MDV), and is characterized by the rapid onset of multifocal aggressive T-cell lymphoma in the chicken host. Although several viral oncogenes have been identified, the detailed mechanisms underlying MDV-induced lymphomagenesis are still poorly understood. Many viruses modulate cell cycle progression to enhance their replication and persistence in the host cell, in the case of some oncogenic viruses ultimately leading to cellular transformation and oncogenesis. In the present study, we found that MDV, like other viruses, is able to subvert the cell cycle progression by triggering the proliferation of low proliferating chicken cells and a subsequent delay of the cell cycle progression into S-phase. We further identified the tegument protein VP 22 (pUL 49) as a major MDV-encoded cell cycle regulator, as its vector-driven overexpression in cells lead to a dramatic cell cycle arrest in S-phase. This striking functional feature of VP 22 appears to depend on its ability to associate with histones in the nucleus. Finally, we established that VP 22 expression triggers the induction of massive and severe DNA damages in cells, which might cause the observed intra S-phase arrest.

Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for a hitherto unknown function of the VP 22 tegument protein in herpesviral reprogramming of the cell cycle of the host cell and its potential implication in the generation of DNA damages...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Newcastle disease (ND) is an infectious, highly {{contagious}} {{and destructive}} viral disease of poultry {{and controlled by}} vaccination. In spite of vaccination, incidence of ND was reported in commercial layers with gastrointestinal lesions. This study was undertaken to assess the prevalence and pathotypes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) involved in gastrointestinal tract abnormalities of vaccinated commercial layer chicken of Namakkal region {{for a period of}} three years from 2008 and 2011. Materials and Methods: Pooled tissue (trachea, lung, spleen, proventriculus, intestine and caecal tonsils) samples collected from dead birds on postmortem examination from 100 layer flocks above 20 weeks of age with gastrointestinal lesions were subjected to isolation of NDV in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. Mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index of the isolates were characterized. Flock details were collected from NDV positive flocks to assess the prevalence and impact of NDV on vaccinated commercial layer chicken. Results: Among the 100 <b>flocks</b> examined Newcastle <b>disease</b> virus was detected in 14 flocks as a single infection and 10 flocks as combined infections with worm infestation, necrotic enteritis and coccidiosis. Chicken embryo mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values ranged from 50. 4 to 96. 0 hrs and from 0. 650 to 1. 675 respectively. Affected birds showed anorexia, diarrohea and drop in egg production. Macropathologically, matting of vent feathers, petechial haemorrhage on the tip of proventricular papilla, caecal tonsils and degeneration of ovarian follicles were noticed. The incidence of ND was most commonly noticed in 20 - 50 wk of age and between the months of September to November. Morbidity rate varied from 5...|$|R
40|$|Ovine {{pulmonary}} adenocarcinoma is a contagious {{viral disease}} of sheep {{that results in}} pulmonary neoplasia in some animals. The economic impact can be significant: up to 80 % of the flock can be lost upon first exposure to the virus, with continuing losses that may {{be as high as}} 20 % each year in some <b>flocks.</b> Excluding this <b>disease</b> from a <b>flock</b> is difficult, in part because no diagnostic test can detect animals in the preclinical stage. No effective treatment or vaccine is available, and eradication is challenging. Currently, ovine pulmonary adenomatosis exists in most sheep-raising areas of the world, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia. Iceland is the only country to have successfully eradicated this disease. Etiology Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma results from infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which is also known as the pulmonary adenomatosis virus. This virus {{is a member of the}} genus Betaretrovirus in the Retroviridae. Species Affected Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma mainly affects domesticated sheep (Ovis aries). Sardinian moufflon (Ovis musimon, a species of wild sheep) can also become ill, and a few cases have been reported in domesticated goats. Geographic Distribution Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be found in sheep-raising countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This disease does not occur in Australia or New Zealand. It has been eradicated from Iceland. Transmission Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be transmitted by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or droplets. Infectious virus occurs in the respiratory exudates of infected sheep. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus can be found in tumors, lung fluids, peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs; before tumors develop, the virus is detected in lymphoreticular cells. Horizontal transmission has been demonstrated among sheep of all ages, but neonates seem to be particularly susceptible to infection. There is no evidence that in utero transmission is significant in the epidemiology of this disease; however, recent studies suggest that JSRV might be spread in milk or colostrum. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus does not survive for long periods in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Paratuberculosis or Johne's disease {{caused by}} Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis chronic disease, incurable, difficult to diagnose in ruminants. Economic losses, direct and indirect, {{associated with it}} and possible links to Crohn's disease in humans, justifying more and more exhaustive study of this disease, {{and the establishment of}} preventive measures. An epidemiological survey was conducted on 13 sheep farms or effectives in the region of Serra da Estrela, in Portugal, with clinical suspicion of paratuberculosis, with the objective to to identified <b>flock’s</b> carriers of <b>disease</b> cases and, subsequently, characterize and identify the main risk factors and implement prophylactic measures, as part of an eradication plane that allows it’s control. Therefore, in this work were tested several diagnosis’ methods, that included serological methods, histopatological diagnosis’ methods, immunohistochemical`s methods, direct PCR and bacteriological culture. The results were presented in details and revealed positive animals in the different diagnostic techniques. The serological methods revealed, by Enzime Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), 235 positive samples (9. 1 %) 45 doubtful (1. 7 %), in 2589 samples and by Agar Gel Immunodiffusion (AGID) 30 positive samples. In histopathological exam, considering the presence of {{at least one of the}} microscopic lesions characteristic of the disease, we classified 26 (60, 5 %) animals as compatible with Paratuberculosis. In Ziehl-Neelsen method was observed alcohol-acid-resistant bacteria in 20 animals (46, 5 %). In immunohistochemical method, also 20 animals (46, 5 %) revealed the presence of MAP. The PCR analysis of samples collected at necropsies, revealed 35 positive animals (81, 4 %). So, all the diagnostic tests applied, showed lower sensitivity than the PCR technique of tissues. The authors concluded that the incidence of the disease in this Portuguese region was high and regarding the preventive measures and given the specific characteristics of the farms of this particular region the authors proposed: the conduct of surveys to identify animals carrying the disease, attention to verify the origin of the animals to acquire surveillance of symptoms shown by animals, isolation of lambs, the use of previously pasteurized colostrums, prevent the use of manure on fertilization of pastures...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was planned under the project "Development and Application of Decision Support Tools to Conserve and Sustainably Use Genetic Diversity in Indigenous Livestock and Wild Relatives" funded by UNEP-GEF-ILRI-FAnGR (United Nations Environment Programme-Global Environment Facility-International Livestock Research Institute-Farm Animal Genetic Resources) to study the {{production}} systems along with phenotypic and genetic characterization of the nine chicken populations in six randomly selected villages within two agro-ecological zones (Site-I; sandy desert and Site-II; irrigated plains) of Punjab province involving participatory rural appraisals, household surveys and in-depth monitoring tools. Information collected through Participatory Rural Appraisals showed that {{the main purpose of}} chicken keeping was home consumption and family income. Preferred chicken breeds among moderate and poor farmers were Fayoumi (FYM), Rhode Island Red (RIR) and Desi and were kept for egg production while Aseel (ASL) was the choice of well off and kept for prestige or hobby. Egg production, size of egg and plumage color was the traits preferred for FYM and RIR, broodiness, mothering ability, disease resistance and taste of meat for Desi and Naked Neck (NNK) while aggressiveness and body stature were highly ranked for ASL. Household surveys showed that most of the farm activities were headed by the household head yet women were involved in all farm activities generally and in chicken keeping particularly at both sites. More number of farmers was involved in chicken keeping at Site-I as compared to Site-II. Semi-intensive chicken production system with free range during day time and confined under shed at night with birds fed on household grains along with scavenging was reported in majority of the cases throughout the year. Average prices of birds were higher at Site-II and were highest for ASL. Health coverage was poor at both sites with most of the farmers treating birds at the help of their own or with neighbors and friends. There was almost absence of any formal training from any NGO or any government department. Sources of information about chicken related issues were poor. Chicken and eggs were marketed at farm gate, village markets or to neighbors and income obtained from extra sale of chicken and eggs was mostly kept by women, followed by household heads. Indepth monitoring revealed higher number of laying hens than other age classes among <b>flocks.</b> The <b>disease</b> was major reason for exit and bird entries were mainly through household hatched hatch and purchase. Most of the birds at both sites were multi colored or brown in plumage with undefined feather pattern. Body weights and linear measurements were higher for ASL and birds at Site-I than those at Site II. Genetic characterization of nine chicken populations viz, ASL; NNK; FYM; RIR; FRR (FYM x RIR); FRA (FYM x RIR x ASL); FRU (FYM x RIR x unknown); OLD (other local Desi) and OCB (other crossbred) using 20 microsatellite markers were found to be polymorphic. The number of alleles per locus within chicken populations ranged from 2 to 14 with an average of 9. 6 alleles per locus. Structure and Principal Coordinate Analysis was clustered into two distinct groups with two maternal lineages distributed among the nine populations. These results indicated that although these nine chicken populations have already been intermixed up to some extent yet most of them were genetically different enough to be considered as separate breeds or genetic group...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the situation of sheeppox (SP) in Kassala State, Sudan. Three methods were adopted to achieve the fore-mentioned goal. These methods were questionnaire survey, collection of available data from veterinary services records and detection of antibodies against sheeppox virus (SPV) in the serum samples collected from different localities of the state using agar gel immuno-diffusion (AGID) test. The questionnaire survey outcomes showed that most of the sheep owners have a good knowledge about SP as an epizootic disease in the state. Moreover, 80 % of the owners confirmed the presence of the disease in their sheep <b>flocks.</b> Thus, the <b>disease</b> represents a real problem for the sheep owners in the state. From the previously reported outbreaks of SP, which obtained from the veterinary services records, the control of the disease can be achieved easily by means of vaccination which is possible in the state. In addition, the good infrastructure of the veterinary services in Kassala state may help and push the control program of the disease towards sunlight. Out of the 502 serum samples, collected from both sexes of sheep, four age groups (1 - 12, 13 - 24, 25 - 36, 37 - 48 months) and two production system settled and nomad, were tested using AGID test, 319 (63. 55 %) of them were positive by the test, whereas 183 (36. 45 %) were negative. High prevalence of antibodies against SPV was in samples from Algash locality (69. 57 %, n= 115) followed by Kassala locality (66. 89 %, n= 151), Nahr Atbara locality (63. 79 %, n= 116) and Setiet locality (53. 33 %, n= 120). Results of risk factors analysis with respect to age groups and sex of sampled animals revealed no statistical significance between disease prevalence and age and sex (χ²= 2. 3751, P-value= 0. 498) and (χ²= 0. 2039, P-value= 0. 652), respectively. However, the highest level of the prevalence was observed in females (64. 05 %, n= 253) and the age less than one year (65. 63 %, n= 233). VIII In conclusion, the findings obtained imply SP is widely distributed in Kassala state localities. It can also be concluded that AGID test is a reliable test to be applied for the detection of SP antibodies under Sudan condition. However, the need for further investigations using more advanced techniques is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Infections {{caused by}} the small {{ruminant}} lentiviruses (SRLV) of sheep (maedi visna virus) and goats (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus) are a serious economical threat to small ruminant farming particularly in the more intensive settings like dairy farms. Revenue is ultimately negatively influenced by decreased milk production, reduced birth-rate and bodyweight and trade limitations 1, 2, 3. Chronically infected animals have a poor body condition and may display progressive dyspnoea, painful arthritis and indurative mastitis, factors that markedly affect animal welfare. However, in well managed <b>flocks</b> overt clinical <b>disease</b> is hardly seen because affected animals are culled in {{an early stage of}} this perniciously progressive disease, hence the only sign is an increased replacement rate. The infection spreads lactogenically from dam to progeny through colostrum and/or milk and horizontally on one hand via the natural close contact between the dam and her progeny 4, 5 {{and on the other hand}} between flock members via direct and indirect contacts 6, 7. Vertical -prenatal- transmission is generally considered to be of low or no importance. Infections are microscopically characterised by lymphoid infiltrations and inflammatory lesions in the lungs, the udder, the carpal joints and the central nervous system 8, 9, 10. There is no cure for this usually slowly progressive disease. Identification of infected individuals by laboratory testing and strict farm and animal sanitary management are corner-stones of programs for control and are at the same time the only tools available for reducing the prevalence of infection. Caution with respect to the reliability of laboratory testing for SRLV infections is augmented by the growing knowledge of the RNA viral genomes and their expression products. Immense genetic heterogeneity hampers protein as well as viral genome based tests. Due to sub-optimal laboratory tests generating false negative results, an early diagnosis is easily missed which will lead to spread of infection. This reduces the farmers’ support for control programs which was already under pressure because of the costs involved, the low direct market returns and the ‘invisibility’ of the long-term returns. Improvement of the diagnostic tools combined with improved test strategies will enable early detection of infection. Moreover, especially, the use of milk samples in stead of blood and in particular the use of bulk milk samples for the antibody detection as well as the molecular biological detection of SRLV infections could lead to considerable cost reduction. The small ruminant lentiviruses, a subfamily of the retroviruses, will need continuous attention because they are prone to diagnostic test escape as a result of their rapid evolving genomes 7, 11, 12 with consequences at the genomic and epitope level 13. Thus, the use of complementary tests is currently required and molecular-epidemiological surveillance is a prerequisite...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma {{control in}} any poultry company {{requires}} an integrated approach involving diligent biosecurity, animal husbandry and disease surveillance. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection is very costly to the broiler industry as it predisposes birds {{to a variety}} of primary and secondary respiratory diseases thus reducing production efficiency and profitability. Since the primary disease is rather insidious, relatively difficult to confirm (especially in vaccinated flocks), prone to becoming quiescent and vertically transmitted, control measures must begin at the breeder level and involve conscientious <b>flock</b> surveillance. While <b>disease</b> eradication is the best approach to MG control the economic pressures of modern broiler production often preclude such drastic measures. Vaccination programmes are often introduced to reduce the economic impact of the <b>disease</b> in breeder <b>flocks</b> and to minimize, or hopefully prevent vertical transmission. To prevent vertical transmission and lateral spread of field strain MG infection, early diagnosis is critical. Flock testing needs to be done every 2 - 4 weeks (depending on prevailing risk), on 90 birds (for an average flock of 7 000 birds) to satisfy statistical requirements for the detection of a 5 % infection-rate with 99 % confidence. The RSPA test provides an inexpensive, reliable and rapid means of evaluating the serological response to ts- 11 strain vaccination during the rearing phase. A floor pen trial confirmed that, three to ten weeks after ts- 11 vaccination at 10 weeks of age, the RSPA test reactor rate is between 30 % and 60 %. PCR was used to confirm the absence of field challenge. A retrospective analysis of 4 years of RSPA test data from broiler breeder flocks immunized with the live ts- 11 strain MG vaccine indicated that traditional RSPA test monitoring protocols were unreliable as a means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccination from field strain MG infection. Non-infected (PCR negative) vaccinated flocks reached sero-positive agglutination rates of 100 % making the differentiation of vaccine response and field infection impossible during the lay cycle. RSPA monitoring of broiler breeders during the pullet rearing stage (0 - 20 weeks) was in contrast still very effective. While previously reported trials indicated that the introduction and subsequent serological monitoring of in-contact non-vaccinated sentinels may enhance the efficacy of the RSPA monitoring procedure this trial indicated that it does not. The ts- 11 strain MG spread to in-contact sentinels so rapidly under field conditions that the serum agglutination pattern of these birds mimics that of the vaccinated pullets. The potential for ts- 11 strain MG to spread from bird to bird is a reality and even spread from pen to pen (within the same house) may be possible if biosecurity is inadequate. The decision to vaccinate should include consideration as to the consequence of ts- 11 strain MG spread to surrounding susceptible flocks. The use of molecular diagnostic techniques on pooled tracheal swabs taken from representative flock birds is a potentially cost effective and reliable means of differentiating ts- 11 vaccine strain from field strain MG. PCR amplification of DNA from tracheal swab samples and strain identification based on amplicon size was shown to be a reliable and sensitive means of detecting ts- 11 strain following vaccination. The proprietary PCR primer used in this trial was specifically designed to identify the ts- 11 strain by amplifying a 229 bp fragment that is characteristic and distinguishable from all other MG field strain isolates based on amplicon size. This technique provides the opportunity to differentiate field strain infection from vaccine strain MG, provided strain specific PCR primers are available. It is recommended that the RSPA assay is used to differentiate effective vaccination from field exposure during pullet rearing and PCR assay is used to monitor broiler breeder flocks for MG challenge during the laying cycle and confirm that point-of-lay broiler breeder pullets are free of field strain MG infection. Where possible flocks with a confirmed field strain challenge should be eliminated and all hatching eggs removed from the hatchery and destroyed. Dissertation (MMedVet (Altil.))
