The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell {{in the months following}} the crisis, the legislature began making difficult <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to fund state programs. The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided {{that the best way to}} reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from direct employment with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less staff and resources.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{to react to}} sexual arousal is {{dependent}} upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E

2500|$|Ira Katznelson {{has argued}} that {{although}} the federal government expanded its power and began providing welfare benefits on a scale previously unknown in the United States, it often allowed individual states to control the allocation of the funds provided for such welfare. This meant that the states controlled who had access to these funds, which in turn meant many southern states were able to racially segregate – or in some cases, like a number of counties in Georgia, completely exclude African-Americans—the allocation of federal funds. This enabled these states to continue to relatively exercise their rights and also to preserve the institutionalization of the racist order of their societies. While Katznelson has conceded that {{the expansion of the}} federal government had the potential to lead to federal-state tension, he has argued it was avoided as these states managed to retain some control. As Katznelson has observed, [...] "furthermore, they [...] had to manage the strain that potentially might be placed on local practices by investing authority in federal bureaucracies… To guard against this outcome, they key mechanism deployed was a separation of the source of funding from <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to spend the new monies." ...|$|E
40|$|When {{escaping}} from predators, ground-foraging birds could choose between two escape strategies with different costs: running or flying. We simulated predator attacks on black-birds Turdus merula {{to investigate the}} factors influencing blackbirds to select between these strategies. The probability that blackbirds would fly increased as flight initiation distance de-creased, suggesting that they may trade-off benefits of delaying escape with a costly escape strategy. The probability of flying also increased {{as the number of}} potential predators in-creased, indicating an increase in perceived predation risk with the number of non-attacking predators. Running was more likely {{to be used in the}} mornings and flying in the afternoons, suggesting a possible mass-dependent predation risk effect or restrictions in the use of costly escape strategies when energetic reserves are lower. Juvenile blackbirds tended to fly away more often than adults, probably to compensate for their less reliable risk assessments due to lack of experience. We conclude that different factors act independently on choosing an optimal escape strategy, and that the <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> when to escape (flight initiation distance) is associated with the <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to escape (escape strategy), which in turn can affect the <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> far to escape (distance fled) ...|$|R

2500|$|Based on Greene's {{experience}} with the genre, an island with many terrain features was picked as the first map, known as [...] "Erangel". The map design scope was to offer players many possible options for strategic and unique gameplay. Some buildings and structures were designed to depict {{the style of the}} brutalist architecture of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. The developer team then playtested architecture features and random item placement systems, looking at both how close-quarters encounters went, and for open terrain areas. The goal was then to optimize the right distribution and placement of weapons and gear across the map, to encourage players to make strategic <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to proceed in the game without overly penalizing players that may not find weapons within the first few minutes of a round. As of May 2017, two additional maps are currently under development: one set on a fictional island in the Adriatic Sea that had part of the Yugoslavian territories which will include snow-covered areas, and a second set in the remains of a desert city in Peru that has been ravaged by war and sandstorms. Greene recognized that the Erangel map felt disjointed despite meeting their goals for gameplay, and sought to create more unified ideas with the next maps.|$|E

They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined. Powerful emotions were in play that many observers today refer to as love – boundless, unquestioning love." ...|$|E
2500|$|To get fair labour {{standards}} beyond the minimum, {{the most important}} right is to collectively participate in <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> an enterprise is managed. This works through collective bargaining, underpinned by the right to strike, and a growing set of rights of direct workplace participation. Workers {{must be able to}} vote for trustees of their occupational pensions under the Pensions Act 2004. In some enterprises, such as universities, staff can vote for the directors of the organisation. In enterprises with over 50 staff, workers must be informed and consulted about major economic developments or difficulties. This happens through a steadily increasing number of work councils, which usually must be requested by staff. However, the UK remains behind European standards in requiring all employees to have a vote for their company's board of directors, alongside private sector shareholders, or government authorities in the public sector. Collective bargaining, between democratically organised trade unions and the enterprise's management, has been seen as a [...] "single channel" [...] for individual workers to counteract the employer's abuse of power when it dismisses staff or fix the terms of work. Collective agreements are ultimately backed up by a trade union's right to strike: a fundamental requirement of democratic society in international law. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 strikes are basically lawful if they are [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute".|$|E
