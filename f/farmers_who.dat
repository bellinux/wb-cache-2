30|$|It {{is assumed}} that a <b>farmer</b> <b>who</b> has gained formal {{education}} can critically analyze and make own decisions between technologies (Enete and Igbokwe 2009; Caleb and Ramatu 2013). Therefore, a <b>farmer</b> <b>who</b> has gained formal education {{is more likely to}} adopt crop insurance and pay higher amounts as premium.|$|R

5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> protested {{what they saw as}} a threat to their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Aria Kebonan {{proves to}} be an unpopular ruler. One day, he hears that both Naganingroem and the king's former concubine, Dewi Pangrenjep, are pregnant. With Dewi Pangrenjep, Aria Kebonan plans to {{eliminate}} Naganingroem's son. During childbirth the son is replaced with a dog, while Dewi Pangrenjep takes the newborn and throws him into a river. He is later found and rescued by <b>farmers,</b> <b>who</b> name him Tjioeng Wanara. Dewi Pangrenjep, meanwhile, gives birth to a son, Aria Banga.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, a bonus was introduced to reward <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> retained their best bulls, even though they were not productive. The increase in weight of the animals began with improved grassland. The second half of the 19th century saw the arrival of fertilizers and improved pastures such as clover and ryegrass, which not only improved the productivity of existing fields but also transformed the moorland pasture. Vineyards affected by phylloxera were also being returned to pasture.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, a Junkers Ju 188 {{was shot}} down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was {{scattered}} across the village, including the church wall. Later, the inhabitants had to be evacuated when a bomb fell into the field opposite Manor Farm, {{and had to be}} defused and removed by the Royal Engineers. In 1962, the Dutton Estate holdings were sold to seven tenant <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> retained the land they farmed but sold the remaining woodlands and properties.|$|E
5|$|The Liberal {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district. Because each voter {{in the cities}} was given five votes, the Liberal party was defeated despite winning a higher total number of votes than the United <b>Farmers,</b> <b>who</b> had much higher support in the rural single-member districts.|$|E

5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by the Chippewa people of North America as a charm, and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> are not allowed to use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with breathable first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from sternal abscesses.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit <b>farmers,</b> <b>who</b> {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> farmed over , but the majority were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E

5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{currently}} has control over 17 gompas in West Kameng district. The monastery has administrative control over two dzongs, each {{headed by a}} monk; the Darana Dzong built in 1831 and the Sanglem Dzong, also known as Talung Gompa, in the south west part of Kameng district. These dzongs not only collect taxes but also preach Buddhism to the Monpas and Sherdukpens of Kameng. The monastery owns cultivable lands in the villages of Soma and Nerguit and a few patches in some other villages which are tilled and cultivated by <b>farmers,</b> <b>who</b> share the produce with the monastery. The present resident head of the monastery is the incarnate Gyalsy Rinpochey.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed {{considerable}} international prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire and had become an emerging power in the international arena. While PedroII was receiving medical treatment in Europe, the parliament passed, and Princess Isabel signed on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law, which completely abolished slavery in Brazil. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery proved to be unfounded. Nonetheless, the end of slavery was the final blow to any remaining belief in the crown's neutrality, and this resulted in an explicit shift of support to Republicanism by the ultraconservatives—themselves backed by rich and powerful coffee <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> held great political, economic and social power in the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{was born}} in Minonk, Illinois in 1872, the fifth of six boys. His parents were Angus Sutherland Thom and Louisa (Herick) Thom, Scottish/Irish <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> had settled in Illinois shortly before the American Civil War. Charles Thom {{was raised in a}} {{strongly}} religious household; his father was an elder in the Presbyterian church. Thom upheld Presbyterian values throughout his life, kept active in church affairs, and became a staunch prohibitionist. His early years spent working on his father's farm instilled the value of a strong work ethic, and first-hand knowledge of agricultural practices that would prove useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Willie Alben Barkley, {{the eldest}} of John Wilson and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley's eight children, was born November 24, 1877. His grandmother, midwife Amanda Barkley, {{delivered}} him in the log house she lived in with her husband, Alben, in Wheel, Kentucky. Barkley's parents were tenant <b>farmers</b> <b>who</b> grew tobacco, and his father was an elder in the local Presbyterian church. Both parents were religious, opposed to playing cards and alcohol. Occasionally, Barkley's parents would leave him {{in the care of}} his grandparents for extended periods. During these times, his grandmother related stories of her relatives. Her childhood playmates included future U.S. Vice President Adlai Stevenson I and James A. McKenzie, a future U.S. Representative from Kentucky.|$|E
