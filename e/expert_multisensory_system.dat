The working principle of Microtox ® analyser {{is based on a}} registration of luminescence from Vibrio fischeri bacteria.

Due to the fact that metabolism is influenced by multiple parameters the method is associated with certain limitations.

Unimodal (audio-only) denoising is very difficult when the noise source is non-stationary, complex (e. g., another speaker or music in the background), strong and not individually accessible in any modality (unseen). Cross-modal association can help: a clear video can direct the audio estimator. We show this using an example-based approach. A training movie having clear audio provides cross-modal examples. In testing, cross-modal input segments having noisy audio rely on the examples for denoising. The video channel drives the search for relevant training examples.
