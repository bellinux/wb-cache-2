2500|$|Heath took Britain {{into the}} European Economic Community on 1 January 1973 {{after winning the}} decisive vote in the House by 336-244. It was, says biographer John Campbell, [...] "Heath's finest hour." [...] Meanwhile, on the {{domestic}} front, <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> led him into confrontation {{with some of the}} most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the oil shock resulted in much of the country's industry working a Three-Day Week to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with leaders of the Liberal Party to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|Uzbekistan {{experienced}} <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> {{of around}} 1000% per year immediately after independence (1992-1994). Stabilization efforts implemented with active guidance from the International Monetary Fund rapidly paid off, as inflation rates were brought down to 50% in 1997 {{and then to}} 22% in 2002. Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.|$|E
50|$|However, a {{few more}} years would pass before the term turbo folk made a {{comeback}} in earnest. 1993 was a year of severe economic hardship and <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> in FR Yugoslavia. War was being fought only a few hundred kilometres away and the country was under an international trade embargo; many Serbian citizens sought solace in the escapist sounds of commercial folk music.|$|E
50|$|A miners' strike {{began on}} 21 December 1920 in Husino when the miners {{requested}} {{a rise of}} wages of 30-45% to counter the <b>gallop</b> <b>inflation</b> which had paralyzed {{the economy of the}} Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (+60% between August and December 1920). Even with threats in the event of refusal of the authorities, the miners began a general strike. This very badly accommodated by the authorities who took radical measures to counter it. On the night of 27-28 December 1920, they sent a troop of 19 gendarmerie and police officers, who were ordered to evacuate the houses of the strikers in order to capture them and to counterbalance them, to Husino, which was then regarded as general headquarter of the strike movement.|$|R
50|$|World War I {{brought the}} boom to an end. Schmidt was arrested as an enemy-alien, as Estonia {{belonged to the}} Russian Empire, and was sent to an {{internment}} camp for about six months. After his release, he remained under police control {{and some of his}} suspicious-looking astronomical equipment was confiscated. He attempted to continue his business, but as the war dragged on and turned to defeat for Germany, the economy became grim and scientists had no money for astronomy. The situation did not improve after the war because of the political turmoil in Germany and the need to pay war reparations. <b>Inflation</b> <b>galloped</b> out of control in 1923 and many people lost their entire savings. By the mid-1920s, Schmidt's business was ruined and he had to liquidate his remaining equipment as junk.|$|R
50|$|With his {{cinematic}} profile raised, in 1993, Dragojević was set {{to begin}} shooting a campy Almodóvaresque project tentatively titled Devedesete (The Nineties) about loyalty, jealousy, infidelity, and intimacy, with the original plan to shoot three separate endings and distribute three versions of the film. However, the financial implosion of the state-owned production studio Avala Film amid <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> in FR Yugoslavia {{put an end to}} that project.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the Law on the Revaluation of Mortgages {{and other}} Claims of 16 July 1925 ( [...] or [...] ) {{included}} only {{the ratio of}} the paper mark to the gold mark for the period from January 1, 1918, to November 30, 1923, and the following days. The <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> thus caused the end of a principle, [...] "a mark is worth a mark", which had been recognized, the nominal value principle.|$|E
5000|$|This {{disrupted}} the whole economy of Poland, and <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> began. The [...] marek and 5,000 marek banknotes became worthless in two years. As hyperinflation progressed, Poland came to print 1, 5 and 10 million mark banknotes. However, they were quickly almost valueless. 10 million marks cost only US$1,073 in January 1924. Immediate action was needed. Władysław Grabski {{was invited to}} stop the pending hyperinflation. As a result, the second Polish złoty was created.|$|E
50|$|Alessandri soon {{discovered}} that his efforts to lead would be blocked by the conservative Congress. Like Balmaceda, he infuriated the legislators by going over their heads {{to appeal to the}} voters in the congressional elections of 1924. His reform legislation was finally rammed through Congress under pressure from younger military officers, who were sick of the neglect of the armed forces, political infighting, social unrest, and <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> the {{controversial}} privatisation programme and austerity measures imposed by his administration caused {{the ruling party}} to lose ground, leading up to {{the controversial}} elections of 1988. On Election Day 1988, the computer system used to count the votes shut down, as Cárdenas held an initial lead. That event is remembered by the prase se cayó el sistema (the system crashed). When the system was restored, Carlos Salinas was declared the winner. The expression “se cayó el sistema” became a euphemism for electoral fraud.|$|E
5000|$|Financial {{problems}} {{forced the}} Prince on 27 January to order banknotes {{to the amount}} of 3 million Rigsbankdaler to be issued by [...] "The Provisional Rigsbank of Norway", stamped with the Norwegian coat of arms, to be redeemed by the Rigsbank. These so-called [...] "Prince notes" [...] were necessary to keep the wheels of government turning, but they contributed to the already chaotic monetary situation and the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation.</b> The cause of the financial crisis was the refusal of King Frederick VI to establish a Bank of Norway.|$|E
50|$|Miguel de la Madrid was {{the first}} of a series of economists to rule the country, a {{technocrat}} who started to implement neoliberal reforms, causing the number of state-owned industries to decline from 1155 to a mere 412. After the 1982 default, crisis lenders were unwilling to loan Mexico and this resulted in currency devaluations to finance spending. An earthquake in September 1985, in which his administration was criticised for its slow and clumsy reaction, added more woe to the problems. As a result of the crisis, black markets supplied by goods stolen from the public sector appeared. <b>Galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> continued to plague the country, hitting a record high in 1987 at 159.2%.|$|E
5000|$|S gol v rukata... (With Naked ... in Hand) is {{the third}} studio album by the Bulgarian rock band Hipodil, {{released}} in 1996 under the Riva Sound label. The album marks a slight departure from the established musical style of the group, with many experiments and new influences including plenty of ska motifs. The most important change however {{was the lack of}} openly [...] "funny" [...] songs which probably was provoked by the deteriorating economic situation in Bulgaria, the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> and the rise in the organised crime at the time. S gol v rukata... never reached the success of Hipodil's previous effort Nekuf ujas, nekuf at or of their next album Nadurveni vuglishta.|$|E

5000|$|David Stevens remarked, [...] "With the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> {{that was}} right {{at the start of}} the 80's, we had got to the point where we were {{building}} seven cars a week but not showing any profits for it. There are only two solutions available to such a problem, and the first is that you either make more automobiles and sell them for the same price, or you sell the same number of cars, but at a higher price. If you sell the car for a higher price then there has to be something apparent on the car to justify the increase to the public. Although your costs per unit mustn't go up. We took the latter path and upped the price and the spec.- the new Series IV equipment now comprised electric windows, central locking, cruise control, electrically operated front seats, Blaupunkt AM/FM stereo radio/cassettes and a removable hardtop.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 new coins (1, 5, 10 and 20 fenigs) and {{banknotes}} (½, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 markas) {{were introduced}} {{and started to}} replace all the previously-used currencies. All the banknotes were white with the White Eagle of Poland on a red field. At {{the time of the}} Armistice of November 11, 1918, 880 million markas were already in circulation. The new Polish government decided to retain the marka as currency and to allow the Loan Bank to continue operating. The following year the German-made banknotes were replaced in circulation with new ones. These featured Polish historical motifs. The notes of 10 and 500 markas displayed a picture of Queen Jadwiga, the notes of 5, 10, 100 and 1000 markas showed Tadeusz Kościuszko. A silver coin of 50 markas was planned but never issued due to the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation.</b> Only one such coin is known to exist today.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{continued}} to paint {{to the end}} of his days, but with the First World War and <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> and changing fashions in art, his best days were behind him. Although the last three decades of his life belonged to the twentieth century, he was essentially a representational artist of the late nineteenth. While some of his work showed heightened effects, he had little affinity with mid century romantic painters, preferring a more literal style. Nevertheless, he experimented freely, showing on occasion modern influences, including the Impressionists. His style became less formal with time, as he came to use broader brushstrokes in a more telling way. He was not swayed by the Irish nationalism that emerged late his career, which tended towards idealising the western landscape and his work is notable for its repudiation of sentimental effects. He showed the cottages, cabins and hovels of those living on the western seaboard exactly as they were, not as perfectly white washed cottages in serried ranks. Similarly, his work was often characterised by louring clouds which are so typical of the Atlantic climate. The authenticity of his work is compelling, showing the west as it was. Known as a bon viveur with a ready stock of humorous anecdotes, Williams nevertheless in his art showed the melancholy side to the west of his day, capturing as few have done since, its sense of remoteness and solitude. He died on November 16, 1930.|$|E
5000|$|European powers {{imposed a}} series of [...] "unequal treaties" [...] in the 1850s and 1860s that gave privileged roles to their {{nationals}} in specially designated treaty ports. Representative was the 1858 Treaty with the United States, called the [...] "Harris Treaty." [...] It opened the ports of Kanagawa and four other Japanese cities to trade, And provided for the exchange of diplomats. It granted extraterritoriality to foreigners, So that they govern themselves and were not {{under the control of}} Japanese courts or authorities. There were numerous trading stipulations favorable to the Americans. The Dutch, British and Russians quickly followed suit with their own treaties, backed up by their own powerful naval forces. [...] The unequal treaties were part of the series imposed on non-Western countries, such as Persia 1857, Turkey 1861, Siam 1855, and China 1858. The inequality was not quite as severe as suffered by these other countries, but it rankled so much that ending the inequality became a priority that was finally achieved in the 1890s. The humiliation was not as bad as China suffered, but it energized anti-foreign forces inside Japan. On the other hand, the new treaties, provided for tariffs on imports from Europe; imports multiplied by a factor of nine between 1860 and 1864, and the tariff revenue provided major financial backing for the Meiji regime. Exports of tea, silk and other Japanese products multiplied by a factor of four in four years, dramatically stimulating the local economy while causing <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> that drove up the price of rice. The Meiji leaders sketched a new vision for a modernized Japan's leadership role in Asia, but they realized that this role required that Japan develop its national strength, cultivate Japanese nationalism among the population, and carefully craft policies toward potential enemies. The skills and tricks of negotiation had to be learned, so they could compete on an equal basis with experienced Western diplomats. No longer could Westerners be seen as [...] "barbarians"; In time, Japan formed a corps of professional diplomats and negotiators.|$|E

40|$|In August, 1948, Chiang Kai-shek {{decided to}} put the {{currency}} reform to practice that Gold Yuan replaced Fabi as the national currency. He wanted to resolve the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> under the reform, to stable nearly collapsing economical situation, then to maintain at mostly the general function of the KMT authority, to prepare the decisive battle with CCP at last. But Gold Yuan followed {{the old way of}} Fabi by printing too much notes that led to the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> inevitably, and ended as the disastrous failure. The reform did not retrieve the crumbling KMT in power, however it intensified the centrifugal tendency of all classes to the KMT, {{and was one of the}} important factors that led to the loss of control on mainland China by the KMT at last. But the gold, silver, and cash of foreign exchange got in the reform actually supported the move of the KMT authority from mainland to Taiwan with heavy material strength after the defeat of the reform. For Chiang Kai-shek, the defeat of the currency reform removed his worry and expect in some extents that he keep in the mind for the KMT before, to firm his determination and work to withdraw to Taiwan, reorganize the KMT, prepare to restart again, and benefit to extend his political life as the leader of the KMT. So the currency reform of 1948 had some diversified political and economical meanings for the KMT and Chiang Kai-shek, and we may not appraise it as achievement or failure simply...|$|E

40|$|Perestroika and glasnost' have {{affected}} {{all aspects of}} Soviet libraries. Library censorship has been largely abolished. Greater democracy has allowed the formation of library associations and influential staff councils in libraries. There are new approaches to many issues - library education, reader services, ethnic minorities, classification, library history, comparative librarianship. Libraries independent of the state have been set up. But the introduction of market economics, <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> and the breakdown of old administrative structures are causing great uncertainty, especially over funding.

40|$|Latin America’s {{economic}} history seems to repeat itself endlessly, following irregular and dramatic cycles. This sense of circularity is particularly striking {{with respect to}} the use of populist macroeconomic policies for distributive purposes. Again and again, and in country after country, policymakers have embraced economic programs that rely heavily on the use of expansive fiscal and credit policies and overvalued currency to accelerate growth and redistribute income. In implementing these policies, there has usually been no concern for the existence of fiscal and foreign exchange constraints. After a short period of economic growth and recovery, bottlenecks develop provoking unsustainable macroeconomic pressures that, at the end, result in the plummeting of real wages and severe balance of payment difficulties. The final outcome of these experiments has generally been <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> crisis, and the collapse of the economic system.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{embedded}} neo-colonialist exploits of globalization retrenches the Nigerian economy rather than strengthening it – thereby creating new threats to human security and development. Specifically, pre and post- $ 18 billion (USD) debt cancellation Nigeria reels in economic strangulation engendered by global capital. Globalization, viewed as a force of inequality and marginalization constitutes a dividing factor between the developed and developing countries. We seek to concretize the view that despite the excitement generated by globalization as invitation to {{a world that is}} increasingly interconnected and borderless, Nigeria (like other African countries) comes out at a disadvantage. Whereas Nigeria has made and is making enormous contributions to the global economy, yet, it remains at the receiving end of the side effects rather than through the gains of globalization with mounting debt profile, capital flight, local industry collapse, <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> weak currency, over-dependence on imported goods and services, mono-product economy, etc. Hence, the Western allies encourage Nigeria to open the economy for rape, although she has insignificant access to other economies because she lacks the competitive advantage; due in part to bad leadership engendered wittingly or unwittingly by developed world partners...|$|E
40|$|Public {{enterprises}} in Kosovo have {{this form of}} organization from 2009, {{even though most of}} them have existed earlier and have performed their activity as socially owned enterprises. We can distinguish four important periods that influenced their development: the period of establishment and operation in an economy with a socially owned enterprises, the period of 1990 - 1999 characterized by <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> and destruction of assets with minimal utilization of capacity, the period of 2000 - 2007 or the administration of public enterprises by former Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA), their transformation into public enterprises, and the period from 2008 or after the implementation of the Law on public {{enterprises in}} Kosovo (Law no. 03 /L- 087). Public enterprises in Kosovo nowadays are facing numerous challenges including: changing the form of government, introduction of public-private partnership, monopoly, regulation or free formation of prices, privatization or changes in their organizational form, and saving the independent status from the political influence. Almost all public enterprises in Kosovo are having difficulties with revenues which will ensure the development of their activity. Therefore, based on the current situation, public enterprises in Kosovo must prepare to face these challenges and have to find solutions that will help the managements of the public enterprises to meet the minimal requirements which will directly increase the level of services to citizens...|$|E
40|$|PhDThe {{subject of}} this thesis is a study of Spain during the First World War. The Spanish case is {{analyzed}} as the regional version of the general crisis which engulfed the rest of Europe during these years. This crisis was produced by the ideological militancy and social struggle caused by four years of devastating international conflict. It heralded the arrival of mass politics which {{put an end to}} a previous era marked by hierarchical and clientelist politics. This thesis examines how the maintenance of strict neutrality did not save the existing regime in Spain from the impact of the conflict raging in Europe. Spain did not enter the war but the war entered the country and, ironically, a conflict in which Spain did not take part was to alter its contemporary history. The analysis explores the gradual disintegration of the foundations of the ruling system, the Liberal Monarchy restored in December 1874, during and {{as a consequence of the}} First World War. Considerable attention is paid to the impact and importance of the war in producing the decay of the Liberal Monarchy. This process is examined at two levels: the political polarization and subsequent division of the country which was provoked by the debate about belligerence or neutrality, and the social and economic transformations that Spain underwent as consequence a of its privileged position as a supplier to both sides. The result was <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation,</b> widespread social discontent and political turmoil. Under these pressures, the hegemonic system, based on electoral falsification, widespread patronage and mass apathy, collapsed and gave way to an inexorable process of growing working class and right-wing militancy which led to the military coup of 1923...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 186 - 187. The {{research}} at hand describes and assesses the marketing topics and functions that concern the marketing performance of Columbus s. a. r. l., the exclusive agent of Johnson and Johnson; Gillette, Uniliver, and Bristol Myers Squibb products in Lebanon. Columbus along with twelve other decentralized companies form Fattal Holding s.. a. l. which is specialized {{in the distribution}} and marketing of nationally and. internationally branded products. Columbus' marketing environment is shaped by many factors and actors. The demographic environment, for instance, has witnessed drastic changes such as the trend towards urbanization causing a reshuffling of the target market members. The economic environment has been affected by megatrends {{in the past decade}} (1984 - 1994) leading Columbus to adjust its pricing policies to the <b>galloping</b> <b>inflation</b> (1984 - 1992). Consequently, the dollarization policy for its products was introduced. This situation has also led to advantages such as the sharp decline in wage rates. With respect to the political situation, it has affected Columbus due to the military disorder and fragmentation of the national territories in the war era. Columbus took certain measures some of which are still applicable such as decentralization in distribution. With respect to the controllable factors in Columbus' marketing environment, they mainly are the suppliers, marketing intermediaries, customers, and competitors. The suppliers are multinational firms who manufacture highly reputed products and are accredited for their global distribution and excessive worldwide promotions and advertisements. They provide Columbus with advertising and promotion budgets and suggested marketing plans for the individual products. With respect to the marketing intermediaries, they include five subagents which distribute Columbus'_products in the different Lebanese regions (excluding East Beirut), retailers, four advertising agencies for Gillette, Bristol Myers Squibb, Uniliver, and Johnson and Johnson units, and insurance and financial services companies. In addition, Columbus customers include the consumer, institutional, and reseller markets- each with distinctive characteristics. Finally, Columbus' competitors are several; some of its products have strong rival brands while others such as J&J baby care products have few ones. However, the core marketing activities and functions are the ones which determine Columbus health situation. Columbus pursues four major objectives : increase profitability, keeping up the good reputation, creating innovation, and most important market share improvement. The marketing objectives stem from the latter objective and primarily include increasing sales of existing lines, adding new products, and expanding the number of retail outlets. The marketing strategies come in conformity with the stated objectives. Columbus possesses competitive differentiation for its marketing offers; its employed tools in this respect are product, image, and personnel differentiation. The marketing strategies focus on expanding Columbus' market share. With the major aid from its suppliers, Columbus is performing a satisfactory job in implementing and monitoring the annual marketing plans. The market share figures which are high for most of Columbus' products prove that. The marketing mix elements are well managed and integrated with the suppliers' marketing goals. That is, the breadth, length, and depth of Columbus' product mix are well suited to both parties, Columbus and the supplying corporations. Regarding distribution, full market coverage is employed either by Columbus or its five subagents. With respect to pricing, it is not a matter always within Columbus' control. These is some kind of regional pricing excerted by the suppliers for the sake of preventing smuggling of goods from one regional country to another. Promotion, in the case of Columbus, is a field in which it has an advantage for several reasons among which are the professional promotion management of its suppliers and the huge budgets for the promotional activities which primarily come from the suppliers abroad. In summary, Columbus fulfilled its objectives in 1993. Sales growth was achieved and profits were increased {{to the extent that it}} was number one in Fattal Holding s. a. !. in 1993 based on productivity, profitability, and return on investment. Return on investment (measured in terms of 1993 net profits as a percentage of Columbus' capital) increased through increasing sales and market shares and cutting back costs via centralizing the overhead expenses and reducing the variable costs. In the end, it would hardly be appropriate to describe Columbus as an organization that has fully implemented the marketing concept. In the researcher's OpInIOn, Columbus is thought to lie somewhere between the selling and the marketing concept. Reaching a status closer to the latter should be aspired for blunders like high profit margins and no-sales commission policy contribute to drawing it closer and closer to the selling concept rather than to the other, more developed. one. 1 bound copy: xiii, 187 leaves; ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|E
