40|$|Mentor: Tonya SchoenfussIn {{response}} to claims that lactose-intolerant people {{were able to}} drink milk pasteurized utilizing the low temperature, long time method, {{it was decided to}} conduct a study comparing the lactose levels in milk pasteurized with two different methods: low temperature, long time (145 degrees F for 30 minutes) and <b>high</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> (165 degrees F for 15 seconds). It was hypothesized that there would be higher available lactose levels in the milk pasteurized with <b>high</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> method. Milk from Autumnwood Farm, a local creamery that pasteurizes with the low temperature, long time method, was used. Raw milk was also collected {{at the same time and}} pasteurized in small batches at the <b>high</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> method requirements. Milk samples were analyzed with a colorimeter to determine if browning was evident. After sample clean up and Megazyme Lactose and D-Galactose kit preparation, the lactose and D-galactose levels were determined with a spectrometer. Samples were prepared and run through high-performance liquid chromatography. First round results showed minimal differences with the colorimeter; varying largely based on homogenization rather than pasteurization. Spectrometer and HPLC results did not show differences in lactose concentrations in the various samples. Further research will be conducted to see if there are differences in milk protein, to see if the Maillard reaction has changes on the lactose.

40|$|The {{influence}} of thermal processing and preservation techniques on selected bioactive compounds of baobab fruit pulp and juice from Malawi were analysed using RP-HPLC whereas total phenol content (TPC) and antioxidant activity were measured by spectrophotometry. 1 H NMR-based metabolomics {{was used to}} compare the metabolic profile of untreated (UT), <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> (HTST) pasteurised and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> pasteurised with added citric acid (CAHTST) baobab juice samples and to analyse the temporal changes upon different storage conditions. Malawi baobab pulp contains high levels of procyanidin B 2 (533. 3 ± 22. 6 mg/ 100 g FW), vitamin C (465. 8 ± 2. 5 mg/ 100 g FW), gallic acid (68. 5 ± 12. 4 mg/ 100 g FW) and (-) -epicatechin (43. 0 ± 3. 0 mg/ 100 g FW) and showed high TPC and antioxidant activity. Vitamin C content of dry baobab pulp and 10 % juice (w/v) was retained during heat treatment by microwaving and pasteurisation (72 °C, 15 s) respectively. However vitamin C level in pasteurised juice significantly decreased during storage compared to untreated control, suggesting the demand for advanced processing methods including non-thermal pasteurisation. Seed liquor enhanced phenolic compounds in the juice but its influence on vitamin C needs further investigation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 1 H NMR data produced distinct clusters separated according to treatment and storage conditions. For HTST and CAHTST juice samples, the most important accumulating metabolites were fructose, glucose and galacturonic acid, while sucrose decreased over time. The more rapid production of ethanol in UT juice is a clear indication that pasteurisation of juice alone or in combination with the addition of citric acid can minimise fermentation in baobab juice. Results from this study will enhance understanding of composition of baobab fruit products and promote development of quality novel functional foods to tackle malnutrition as well as expand market opportunities for Malawi...|$|E
