Here we <b>emphasize</b> <b>marker</b> assisted introgression in crossbred populations, and marker assisted selection in outbred populations. As marker typing costs reduce, the value of their use in a breeding programme will be dominated by returns rather than their costs.

The studied sample included 65 women who underwent surgery for breast carcinoma at the Surgical Clinic of Clinical Center Banja Luka, from January 1 st 1997 till January 1 st 1999. Statistical data analysis was performed and correlation of prognostic factors was determined. The majority of authors in this field agree that the primary tumor size and axillary nodal status {{are the two most}} important prognostic factors.

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) {{over the last two decades}} have led to the introduction of multiple classes of oral therapy, but the disease remains devastating for many patients. Disease progression, in spite of oral monotherapy, is a major problem, and alternative therapy, such as infusion of prostacyclins, is cumbersome and carries considerable potential morbidity. Use of combination oral therapy, including drugs from both the endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitor classes, has increased, and there is some evidence to support this approach. Given the multiple options now available in pulmonary hypertension (PH) therapy, biomarkers to guide treatment decisions could be helpful. Here, we review the evidence for and against the clinical use of molecular biomarkers relevant to PH pathogenesis, <b>emphasizing</b> assayable <b>markers</b> that may also inform more rational selection of agents that influence pathways targeted by treatment. We emphasize the interactive nature of changes in mediators and messengers, such as endothelin- 1, prostacyclin, brain natriuretic peptide (which has demonstrated biomarker utility), nitric oxide derivatives, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which play important roles in processes central to progression of PAH, such as vascular remodeling, vasoconstriction, and maladaptive right ventricular changes, and are relevant to its therapy. Accordingly, we propose that the identification and use of a molecular biomarker panel that assays these molecules in parallel and serially might, if validated, better inform unique patient phenotypes, prognosis, and the rational selection and titration of combination oral and other therapy in individual patients with PH/PAH...|$|R

This work was planned to study the different markers for diagnosis of FMDV serotype Sat 2 in adult buffaloes and calves including clinical, hematological and biochemical examinations. A total number of sixty animals were divided into four groups. The first group was apparently healthy adult buffaloes, while the second was naturally infected adult buffaloes, a third group was apparently healthy suckling calves and finally the fourth group was naturally infected suckling calves. The recorded clinical signs were fever, salivation, loss of appetite, depression, lameness, blisters or vesicles, erosions and ulcers in the mucosa of the mouth, tongue, lips, gums, pharynx, palate and between the claws.

There is {{a wealth of}} data available on genetic differentiation among populations of zooplankton with respect to allozyme markers. Data from well-designed studies on ecologically relevant, quantitative traits are less abundant and indicate a different pattern from that obtained using electrophoretic markers. It is argued that whereas the analysis of (quasi) neutral <b>markers</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the importance of long-lasting founder effects and genetic drift, the pattern of local genetic differentiation of ecologically relevant traits may often reflect local adaptation. In reviewing the data, the importance of temporal and spatial habitat selection in maintaining genetic polymorphism for ecologically relevant traits is emphasized, without denying the importance of stochasticity. Most available data are on Daphnia, but studies on other organisms in general confirm the patterns observed in this genus.

It offers an analysis of data extracted from the English-Norwegian Parallel Corpus (the ENPC), as well as an elicitation test conducted after the corpus investigation. The material has been analysed in the light of such parameters as level of formality, genre, pragmatic effect and language of the source text (direction of the translation). The investigation describes {{the relationship between}} the different notions that may be expressed by the English progressive aspect and the various Norwegian progressive markers (for instance sitter og, driver og, er i ferd med å, holder på og and different kinds of adverbials). Such notions include incompletion, iterativity, habituality, currentness, egressiveness, ingressiveness and temporal restrictions on the internal constituency of the situation. An attempt has been made to say something {{about the extent to which}} these Norwegian markers can be said to express the same meaning as the corresponding English progressive verb forms. The results indicate that there is little need for progressive marking in Norwegian.

Even though no single one will do the job, the different progressive <b>markers</b> <b>emphasize</b> different aspectual meanings that can be said to correspond to those expressed by the progressive in English...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{dominant}} {{role in the}} global carbon cycle, changes in tropical forest dynamics can affect {{the pace of the}} climate changes. Today, the only estimation of tropical tree growth comes from permanent plot networks. However, their installation is still much too recent (i. e. beginning of the 80 ’s for the oldest stations) to provide long enough temporal series to answer primordial, yet unsolved questions. Is tropical tree growth controlled by climate variations? Are tropical forests showing long-term changes of their productivity as temperate forests do? What are the impacts of the global changes on tropical forest functioning? An even more basic question is still fully unsolved: how old are tropical trees? Nevertheless, not any sustainable exploitation and management of the tropical forest resources is conceivable without knowing the age of the harvested trees. The dendrochronology approach (i. e. the study of annual rings in trees) was remarkably successful in solving these questions for temperate climate trees. The retrospective analysis of tree growth patterns not only gives direct access to the age of the trees, but allows reconstructing the past effects of the environment on tree physiology over decades or even centuries. However, insurmountable difficulties to identify annual growth rings in most tropical trees (due to nearly constant growth rates over the year) prevented dendrochronologists from using the classical method of ring width measurements. As we urgently need to understand the effects of the ongoing changes in climate and atmosphere on tropical forest, it appears especially important to develop new techniques for tropical dendrochronology. The objective of the project was to evidence the existence of cyclic chemical signals in tropical wood that could compensate for the lack of visible growth rings. The potential of dendrochemical analysis for <b>emphasizing</b> reliable <b>markers</b> of seasonal cycles was tested on trees of known age from three different species: two major long-lived species of the Guianan-Amazon tropical wet forest (Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra) and one from the equatorial African forest (Pericopsis elata). The analyses were performed at the DiffAbs beamline using synchrotron monochromatic X-ray beam of energy 18. 1 keV. For each wood sample, the radial distribution of 17 elements was analyzed from the bark to the pith with a 300 μm spatial resolution using a Silicon Drift Detector. The results showed that these ringless tropical trees, by displaying seasonal variations in wood element composition, can yet keep an archive of their past growth.

As recent diagnostic criteria <b>emphasize</b> serum cardiac <b>markers</b> (in particular serum troponin) we set out to evaluate its clinical utility and to establish the long term prognostic impact of detected abnormal postoperative troponin levels after lung resection. Methods We studied a historic cohort of patients with primary lung cancer who underwent intended surgical resection. Patients were grouped according to known postoperative troponin status and survival calculated by Kaplan Meier method and compared using log rank. Parametric survival analysis was used to ascertain independent predictors of mortality. Results From 2001 to 2004, a total of 207 patients underwent lung resection for primary lung cancer of which 14 (7 %) were identified with elevated serum troponin levels within 30 days of surgery, with 9 (64 %) having classical features of myocardial infarction. The median time to follow up (interquartile range) was 22 (1 to 52) months, and the one and five year survival probabilities (95 % CI) for patients without and with postoperative troponin elevation were 92 % (85 to 96) versus 60 % (31 to 80) and 61 % (51 to 71) versus 18 % (3 to 43) respectively (p T stage and postoperative troponin elevation remained independent predictors of mortality in the final multivariable model.

The aim of this work was to describe the development of health status in soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (ACR) and to <b>emphasize</b> the <b>markers</b> of non-communicable diseases. Our study describes the anthropometric and biochemical parameters of a large group of Czech Army professional soldiers. Data were obtained over a period of 11 years. Methods. During the monitored period, from 1999 to 2009, military physicians carried out on the average 6, 360 examinations on professional soldiers per year and monitored their health and nutritional status with the aim of preventing the risk factors of non-communicable diseases. These examinations are compulsory for all professional soldiers at the age of 25, 30, 33, and 36 years. From the age of 39, these examinations are carried out every year till the end of their career. Besides taking personal histories and carrying out standard physical examinations, blood was taken for biochemical examination. The following anthropometric parameters were monitored: body constitution using body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference. Our study describes only part of the data concerning anthropometric and biochemical parameters of professional soldiers which were obtained over a period of 11 years. Results. Average BMI values in men were in the overweight range (26. 5 - 27 kg/m 2). Average values of waist circumference, however, ranged from 91. 9 cm to 93. 4 cm. Between the first and the last year of monitoring a statistically significant decrease in these values ranging from 93. 4 ± 9. 8 cm to 92. 7 ± 9. 5 cm (p < 0. 001) was observed. All monitored anthropometric parameters in female professional soldiers were within normal limits. During the monitored period the proportion of overweight men gradually increased from 52 % to 57. 1 % (p < 0. 001). There were no statistically significant changes in the prevalence of obesity in men (12 - 15 %). Average glycaemia levels were within normal range in both men and women. A statistically significant decrease in these levels, however, was observed in men (from 5. 1 ± 0. 9 mmol/L to 4. 8 ± 0. 7 mmol/L (p < 0. 001) and in women (from 4. 9 ± 0. 6 mmol/L to 4. 6 ± 0. 6 mmol/L (p < 0. 001). Concerning the lipid profile in men, a significant decrease in average values of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol was observed; from 5. 5 ± 1. 1 mmol/L to 5. 1 ± 1. 0 mmol/L (p < 0. 001), from 2. 0 ± 1. 6 mmol/L to 1. 6 ± 1. 2 mmol/L (p < 0. 001) and from 3. 4 ± 1. 1 mmol/L to 3. 2 ± 0. 9 mmol/L (p < 0. 001), respectively. Conclusion. During the monitored period only one-third of military professionals had normal body weight.

40|$|Aquaculture {{is in need}} of {{improved}} viral vaccines {{to meet the demands of}} a growing sustainable industry. Fish viral vaccines are often based on less immunogenic antigen (Ag) formulations that require adjuvants to elicit sufficient protection. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists holds high immunostimulatory properties and are in mammals well explored vaccine adjuvants. The potential of synthetic TLR-agonists as adjuvants lie in their ability to provide signals engaging both innate and adaptive immunity that in turn may prime an array of immune responses. In this thesis, the main aim has been to increase our knowledge regarding the immunostimulatory properties of the nucleic acid-sensing TLR-agonists CpG and poly I:C in Atlantic salmon. First, the TLR-agonists were included as an adjuvant combo to inactivated whole salmonid pancreas disease virus (SPDV/SAV) Ag formulations where effects on protection against SAV was investigated both by injection and co-habitant challenge. The work show that the combo greatly potentiated neutralizing antibody responses. In line with the challenge studies, it was further investigated if cells in the periphery could take up the soluble antigens CpG and ovalbumin (OVA) and home to the immunological tissues head kidney (HK) and spleen. Indeed, leukocytes homed to the HK and displayed traits common for maturing Ag-presenting cells (APCs). In that study, a B-lymphocyte like IgM positive cell population was described in HK that downregulated early B cell marker transcript, while secreted IgM transcripts were upregulated upon in vitro CpG stimulation. This suggests that the HK harbor antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Based on that, method optimization to characterize Atlantic salmon B cells functionally were initiated. Flow cytometry analysis of naïve salmon using trout monoclonal antibodies show that IgM+ B cells are the dominating Ig class in salmon systemic lymphoid tissues. Moreover, mRNA transcript analyzes of sorted IgM+ B cells from HK, peripheral blood and spleen leukocytes show that they express a range of nucleic acid-sensing TLRs. In addition, CpG stimulation alone was enough to induce IgM secretion in sorted HK and spleen IgM+ B cell cultures. Our findings suggests that these TLRs are promising ‘model- agonists’. To further support the use of these TLR-agonists as adjuvants in finfish viral vaccines, research regarding their direct and indirect effects, particularly on salmon B cells, should be <b>emphasized.</b> This requires <b>markers</b> as well as in vitro and in vivo assays that are yet not in place...|$|R
40|$|OBJECT: Chordoma {{cells can}} {{generate}} solid-like tumors in xenograft models that express some molecular {{characteristics of the}} parent tumor, including positivity for brachyury and cytokeratins. However, there is a dearth of molecular markers that relate to chordoma tumor growth, {{as well as the}} cell lines needed to advance treatment. The objective in this study was to isolate a novel primary chordoma cell source and analyze the characteristics of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model for comparison with the established U-CH 1 and U-CH 2 b cell lines. METHODS: Primary cells from a sacral chordoma, called "DVC- 4," were cultured alongside U-CH 1 and U-CH 2 b cells for more than 20 passages and characterized for expression of CD 24 and brachyury. While brachyury is believed essential for driving tumor formation, CD 24 is associated with healthy nucleus pulposus cells. Each cell type was subcutaneously implanted in NOD/SCID/IL 2 Rγ(null) mice. The percentage of solid tumors formed, time to maximum tumor size, and immunostaining scores for CD 24 and brachyury (intensity scores of 0 - 3, heterogeneity scores of 0 - 1) were reported and evaluated to test differences across groups. RESULTS: The DVC- 4 cells retained chordoma-like morphology in culture and exhibited CD 24 and brachyury expression profiles in vitro that were similar to those for U-CH 1 and U-CH 2 b. Both U-CH 1 and DVC- 4 cells grew tumors at rates that were faster than those for U-CH 2 b cells. Gross tumor developed at nearly every site (95 %) injected with U-CH 1 and at most sites (75 %) injected with DVC- 4. In contrast, U-CH 2 b cells produced grossly visible tumors in less than 50 % of injected sites. Brachyury staining was similar among tumors derived from all 3 cell types and was intensely positive (scores of 2 - 3) in a majority of tissue sections. In contrast, differences in the pattern and intensity of staining for CD 24 were noted among the 3 types of cell-derived tumors (p < 0. 05, chi-square test), with evidence of intense and uniform staining in a majority of U-CH 1 tumor sections (score of 3) {{and more than half of}} the DVC- 4 tumor sections (scores of 2 - 3). In contrast, a majority of sections from U-CH 2 b cells stained modestly for CD 24 (scores of 1 - 2) with a predominantly heterogeneous staining pattern. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on xenografts generated from U-CH 2 b cells in which a low tumorigenicity was discovered despite evidence of chordoma-like characteristics in vitro. For tumors derived from a primary chordoma cell and U-CH 1 cell line, similarly intense staining for CD 24 was observed, which may correspond to their similar potential to grow tumors. In contrast, U-CH 2 b tumors stained less intensely for CD 24. These results <b>emphasize</b> that many <b>markers,</b> including CD 24, may be useful in distinguishing among chordoma cell types and their tumorigenicity in vivo...|$|R
