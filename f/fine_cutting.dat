A friend took Stuart to the studio of a découpage artist. Drawn to the art form, Stuart thought it could replace acting in her life. With Sheekman's encouragement, she opened a shop on Los Angeles's decorators’ row, named it Décor, Ltd. Stuart created découpaged lamps, mirrors, tables, chests and other one of a kind objets d'art.

6000|$|Prince Henri, {{for all his}} complaining, did beautifully this Season again (though to us it must be silent, being small-war merely;--and in particular, MAY 12th) {{early in}} the morning, {{simultaneously}} in many different parts, burst across the Mulda, ten or twenty miles long (or BROAD rather, from his right hand to his left), sudden as lightning, upon the supine Serbelloni and his Austrians and Reichsfolk. And hurled them back, one and all, almost to the Plauen Chasm and their old haunts; widening his quarters notably. [Bericht von dem Uebergang uber die Mulde, den der Prinz Heinrich den 12ten May 1762 glucklich ausgefuhrt (in Seyfarth, Beylagen, iii, 280-291).] A really brilliant thing, testifies everybody, though not to be dwelt on here. Seidlitz was of it (much <b>fine</b> <b>cutting</b> and careering, from the Seidlitz and others, we have to omit in these two Saxon Campaigns!)--Seidlitz was of it; he and another still more special acquaintance of ours, the learned Quintus Icilius; who also did his best in it, but lost his [...] "AMUSETTE" [...] (small bit of cannon, [...] "Plaything," [...] so called by Marechal de Saxe, inventor of the article), and did not shine like Seidlitz.|$|E

60|$|To this {{culminating}} point, therefore, {{covered with}} dust and cobwebs, I attained, as I did to every tomb of importance in Venice, by {{the ministry of}} such ancient ladders as were {{to be found in}} the sacristan's keeping. I was struck at first by the excessive awkwardness and want of feeling in the fall of the hand towards the spectator, for it is thrown off the middle of the body in order to show its <b>fine</b> <b>cutting.</b> Now the Mocenigo hand, severe and even stiff in its articulations, has its veins finely drawn, its sculptor having justly felt that the delicacy of the veining expresses alike dignity and age and birth. The Vendramin hand is far more laboriously cut, but its blunt and clumsy contour at once makes us feel that all the care has been thrown away, and well it may be, for it has been entirely bestowed in cutting gouty wrinkles about the joints. Such as the hand is, I looked for its fellow. At first I thought it had been broken off, but, on clearing away the dust, I saw the wretched effigy had only one hand, and was a mere block on the inner side. The face, heavy and disagreeable in its features, is made monstrous by its semi-sculpture. One side of the forehead is wrinkled elaborately, the other left smooth; one side only of the doge's cap is chased; one cheek only is finished, and the other blocked out and distorted besides; finally, the ermine robe, which is elaborately imitated to its utmost lock of hair and of ground hair on the one side, is blocked out only on the other: it having been supposed throughout the work that the effigy was only to be seen from below, and from one side.|$|E
50|$|Although he {{did some}} work in oils and {{spent a great deal}} of time experimenting with linocuts in his later years, Hughes-Stanton's artistic {{production}} consists mostly of wood engravings. He is known for the very fine white lines of his engravings, which presented considerable difficulty to pressmen trying to print his engravings on hard handmade paper. The engravings are frequently of the female form, and contemporary judgements ranged from erotic to pornographic. Towards the end of his career his engravings featured semi-abstract figures. Examples of his <b>fine</b> <b>cutting</b> and individual style can be seen at the British Council website.|$|E

The sabre was also copied by the Prussians; indeed, some Imperial German troops were equipped with almost identical swords into the First World War. The Americans also adopted a pattern which was directly influenced by the British sword.|$|R

Blades are numbered differently than guards. Rotary clippers are designed to accept a certain standard blade type, so that blades from a variety of manufacturers designed to the specific standard may be utilized on a clipper designed to that standard, regardless of manufacturer. Outliner/edger clippers have a very <b>fine</b> <b>cutting</b> blade and no taper lever and are used to outline a defined arch around the ear and for block cuts, the edge at the nape of the neck.|$|E

40|$|High {{brightness}} lasers {{are required}} for various applications in materials processing. Especially <b>fine</b> <b>cutting</b> and remote welding require high beam quality. Diode end pumped rod lasers are highly efficient lasers operating at high beam quality, but due to thermal induced effects in the laser rod the output power is limited to 10 W. The diode endpumped slab laser (INNOSLAB) we have developed is a promising method to scale the output power to the multi-kW range retaining the high beam quality and efficiency of end pumped rod lasers.

For welding and cutting of heavy steel sections as well as high-speed surface treatment, lasers with high output power are needed; well above 5 kW, which is the maximum for most applications now. Increasing the beam quality is a second trend, which can be observed. High beam-quality systems are essential for sophisticated applications {{in the field of}} quality controlled and precision processing such as <b>fine</b> <b>cutting,</b> high speed cutting and high speed welding.

5000|$|Although RC {{drilling}} is air-powered, {{water is}} also used to reduce dust, keep the drill bit cool, and assist in pushing cutting back upwards, but also when [...] "collaring" [...] a new hole.

40|$|Spent {{metal removal}} fluid (cutting fluid, lubricant, coolant, etc.) is a {{significant}} waste stream from the metal fabrication industry. The quantity of waste generated {{and the cost of}} fluid purchases could be reduced by microlubrication (minimum quantity lubrication, mist lubrication) methods of fluid delivery. In microlubrication, a <b>fine</b> <b>cutting</b> fluid mist is used, rather than the traditional method of flooding the cutting tool ??? workpiece interface. The metal fabrication industry is concerned that the use of microlubrication might reduce tool life negatively impacting production and increasing manufacturing costs. The purpose of this research was to compare the performance (tool life) of cutting tools lubricated and cooled using microlubrication with that of cutting tools lubricated and cooled using traditional flood application. The performance difference identified is used to calculate and compare the economic impact of microlubrication versus flood application.

40|$|The {{electrodes}} of today's lithium-ion {{cells are}} produced as a compound made of copper or aluminium foil several micrometres thick. This film {{functions as a}} conductor and is coated {{on both sides with}} an active material with the capacity to store energy. In battery production, shaping by shear cutting of these planar electrodes is an essential stage in the process chain. However, advanced techniques established in mass production, such as laser cutting and water jet cutting, are not always suitable for the manufacturing process particularly in case of avoiding thermal and chemical impact on the composite material. Conventional shear <b>cutting</b> (<b>fine</b> shear <b>cutting)</b> is also problematic, since the very thin film makes for very tight clearances. One way to circumvent the problems in shear cutting described above results from superposing the punch with vibrations. In the example described in the paper, frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz at vibration amplitudes greater than 3 ?m were used. It was recognised that superposition of vibrations enhances breakage at the cutting edge and, consequently, reduces formation of flash on the electrode contour...|$|R
