40|$|This paper {{examines}} the mechanisms that transmit isolation into poverty in Madagascar using household survey data {{combined with a}} census of administrative communes. Given the importance of agriculture to the rural poor, where {{nine out of ten}} poor persons is engaged in farming, we concentrate on isolation manifesting itself in the form of high transaction costs such as the cost of transporting agricultural commodities to major market centers. We find that (a) the incidence of poverty in rural Madagascar increases with remoteness; (b) yields of major staple crops fall considerably as one gets farther away from major markets; (c) and the use of agricultural inputs declines with isolation. Simulation results using output from rice production function estimates suggest that halving travel time per kilometer on major <b>highways</b> (<b>feeder</b> <b>roads)</b> will increase primary season rice production by 1. 3 (1. 0) percent.

As such, they demonstrate an important phase {{in the evolution of}} the State's road network and tourist industry. The early 1950s saw a major increase in medium to long-distance car travel and tourism. The road rest areas were developed to accommodate this trend by providing places at convenient locations where motorists could rest or camp.|$|R

It will connect Nagpur to Mumbai and have direct connectivity with the country’s largest container port—JNPT. This will enhance EXIM (export-import) trade of the state. Inter-connecting <b>highways</b> and <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> would be constructed to connect all important cities and tourist places along this route. This will connect another fourteen districts indirectly namely Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Akola, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, Dhule, Jalgaon, Palghar and Raigad. In this manner, {{a total of}} twenty-four districts in Maharashtra will be connected via this expressway.|$|R

40|$|Abstracts: We find various loading {{standards}} for bridges {{in different countries}} {{based on their own}} contexts. In the context of Nepal, the road bridges have been designed adopting the various codes. Many of the bridges have been designed based on IRC and AASHTO standards. Nepal Road Standard (NRS 2027), has adopted the IRC and AASHTO loadings. The NRS covers loadings for the <b>highway</b> and <b>feeder</b> <b>roads.</b> The standard does not cover the loading {{standards for}} rural roads in Nepal. Now we have more than 20, 000 km rural roads. This paper tries to review the live load standards which are being adopted in design of bridges in Nepal and recommend the live loads suitable for the bridges in rural roads specifically for district roads and village roads. For rural bridges, individual truck loading may be relevant rather than the train of loading. The 24 R IRC loading may be an appropriate loading for rural bridges in Nepal. This represents a heavy vehicle plying in rural roads in Nepal. 1...|$|R
