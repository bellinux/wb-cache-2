5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey <b>drive,</b> <b>it</b> tends to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, Middle Tennessee quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play <b>drive.</b> <b>It</b> included a fake punt that caught Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard pass for a first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Middle Tennessee re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and Middle Tennessee subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey who ran for an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the Middle Tennessee 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. Middle Tennessee defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone to preserve a Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E

The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> off the hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> {{all the way to the}} customer's house.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> back towards the sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage over one another. Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As he turned around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E

On 3 October, the Yugoslav Navy reinstated its Adriatic blockade. That day, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps ordered a new push towards Zadar to relieve the city's JNA barracks, destroy the ZNG (or <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> from the city) and capture the Port of Zadar in the city centre. The attacking force was augmented by the 1st Battalion of the 592nd Mechanised Brigade. The offensive began at 13:00 on 4 October, supported by artillery, naval and air forces. The besieged JNA garrisons in the city, except for the Šepurine barracks garrison, also provided mortar and sniper support. The 271st Light Artillery Regiment and the 60th Medium Self-Propelled Missile Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Defence, based in Šepurine, broke through the Croatian siege and joined the advancing JNA force. Although the ZNG and the police held the city and inflicted many casualties, by the night of 4–5 October Zadar was besieged by the JNA; this forced the Croatian authorities to request a cease-fire and negotiations.|$|E

5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to <b>drive</b> <b>it</b> off.
