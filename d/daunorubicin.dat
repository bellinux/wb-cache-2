5|$|Doxorubicin and <b>daunorubicin</b> {{together}} can {{be thought}} of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, an Italian {{research}} company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, {{began an}} organized {{effort to find}} anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound {{at about the same}} time, the two teams named the compound <b>daunorubicin,</b> combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that <b>daunorubicin</b> could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than <b>daunorubicin</b> against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} Totect (USA) or Savene (Europe) (dexrazoxane for extravasation) is effective in preventing the progression of anthracycline extravasation into progressive tissue necrosis. In two open-label, single arm, phase II multicenter {{clinical trials}}, necrosis was prevented in 98% of the patients. Dexrazoxane for extravasation is the only registered antidote for extravasation of anthracyclines (<b>daunorubicin,</b> doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, etc.).|$|E
500|$|Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-hydroxylated {{version of}} <b>daunorubicin,</b> the {{immediate}} precursor of DXR in its biosynthetic pathway. <b>Daunorubicin</b> is more abundantly found {{as a natural}} product because it is produced {{by a number of}} different wild type strains of Streptomyces. In contrast, only one known non-wild type species, Streptomyces peucetius subspecies cesius ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin. This strain was created by Arcamone et al. in 1969 by mutating a strain producing <b>daunorubicin,</b> but not DXR, at least in detectable quantities. Subsequently, Hutchinson's group showed that under special environmental conditions, or by the introduction of genetic modifications, other strains of Streptomyces can produce doxorubicin. His group has also cloned many of the genes required for DXR production, although not all of them have been fully characterized. [...] In 1996, Strohl's group discovered, isolated and characterized dox A, the gene encoding the enzyme that converts <b>daunorubicin</b> into DXR. By 1999, they produced recombinant dox A, a cytochrome P450 oxidase, and found that it catalyzes multiple steps in DXR biosynthesis, including steps leading to <b>daunorubicin.</b> This was significant because it became clear that all daunorubicin-producing strains have the necessary genes to produce DXR, the much more therapeutically important of the two. Hutchinson's group went on to develop methods to improve the yield of DXR, from the fermentation process used in its commercial production, not only by introducing dox A encoding plasmids, but also by introducing mutations to deactivate enzymes that shunt DXR precursors to less useful products, for example baumycin-like glycosides. Some triple mutants, that also over-expressed dox A, were able to double the yield of DXR. This is of more than academic interest, because at that time DXR cost about $1.37 million per kg and current production in 1999 was 225kg per annum. More efficient production techniques have brought the price down to $1.1 million per kg for the nonliposomal formulation. Although DXR can be produced semi-synthetically from <b>daunorubicin,</b> the process involves electrophilic bromination and multiple steps, and the yield is poor. Since <b>daunorubicin</b> is produced by fermentation, it would be ideal if the bacteria could complete DXR synthesis more effectively.|$|E
500|$|All FAB subtypes except M3 {{are usually}} given {{induction}} chemotherapy with cytarabine (ara-C) and an anthracycline (most often <b>daunorubicin).</b> This induction chemotherapy regimen {{is known as}} [...] "7+3" [...] (or [...] "3+7"), because the cytarabine is given as a continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an IV push. Up to 70% of people with AML will achieve a remission with this protocol. Other alternative induction regimens, including high-dose cytarabine alone, FLAG-like regimens or investigational agents, may also be used. Because of the toxic effects of therapy, including myelosuppression and {{an increased risk of}} infection, induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly, and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care.|$|E

50|$|Similar to doxorubicin, <b>daunorubicin</b> {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis.

It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C base pairs flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair. Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8°, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs.It can also induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation.|$|E
