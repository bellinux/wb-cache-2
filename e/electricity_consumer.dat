40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the coming into being of a new type of consumer in the electricity sector which we choose to name “responsive consumer”. ‘Responsive’ echoes to ‘demand-response’, a term used by actors in the electricity sector in order to point at the possibility for the electricity demand - so, for the <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer</b> - to become reactive to price signals. “Responsive” also echoes to “responsible” which refers to the integration of an environmental concern that translate in a certain care towards one’s energy consumption. The responsive consumer might thus also respond to other non-price signals such as grid congestion signals, non-wind generated, polluted electricity signals, etc. The paper explores the articulation between the “demonstration” of smart grid as a policy style and the construction of the responsive <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer.</b> The analysis is centered on France and the EU...|$|E

While the cost of the REFIT scheme to the <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer</b> appears to be lower than the cost of schemes in other countries, significant inefficiencies exist as a result of the structure of the scheme. The Irish REFIT scheme is contrasted with a single Fixed Price support scheme and the analysis suggests that the Fixed Price scheme can provide a similar or greater incentive to the wind sector at half the cost to the end <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer,</b> and may also prove more compatible with consumers desire to reduce inter-year electricity portfolio cost volatility...|$|E

40|$|In a smart grid, several {{optimization}} {{techniques have}} been developed to schedule load in the residential area. Most of these techniques aim at minimizing the energy consumption cost and the comfort of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer.</b> Conversely, maintaining a balance between two conflicting objectives: energy consumption cost and user comfort is still a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to minimize the electricity cost and user discomfort while taking into account the peak energy consumption. In this regard, we implement and analyse the performance of a traditional dynamic programming (DP) technique and two heuristic optimization techniques: genetic algorithm (GA) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for residential load management. Based on these techniques, we propose a hybrid scheme named GAPSO for residential load scheduling, so as to optimize the desired objective function. In order to alleviate the complexity of the problem, the multi dimensional knapsack is used to ensure that the load of <b>electricity</b> <b>consumer</b> will not escalate during peak hours. The proposed model is evaluated based on two pricing schemes: day-ahead and critical peak pricing for single and multiple days. Furthermore, feasible regions are calculated and analysed to develop a relationship between power consumption, electricity cost, and user discomfort. The simulation results are compared with GA, BPSO and DP, and validate that the proposed hybrid scheme reflects substantial savings in electricity bills with minimum user discomfort. Moreover, results also show a phenomenal reduction in peak power consumption...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have seen {{increasing}} debate over the allocation of PNW water resources. In particular there are conflicts over using the river system for irrigation vs. electricity production. Denying the hydroelectric system water implies higher costs to <b>electricity</b> <b>consumers</b> as producers substitute more expensive nonhydro resources. This research looked at the impact of new irrigation on PNW <b>electricity</b> <b>consumers.</b> This was done under varying assumptions of demand response and farmer payments for pumping of irrigation water. The study also examined {{the difference between the}} current policy of allowing farmers to take all the water they need, and a policy in which withdrawals are limited in periods of low streamflow. Simulations were run to determine the amount of electricity production lost because of withdrawals. These results were then used in a series of simulations to estimate the economic impacts under the various assumptions and policies. It was found that irrigation caused losses to <b>electricity</b> <b>consumers.</b> In some cases this loss was on the order of $ 200 /acre of irrigated land. The loss was significantly mitigated under the interruptible policy. Farmer payments for irrigation energy also reduced the loss to consumers...|$|R
