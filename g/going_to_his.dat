5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E

5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|Instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> physical, Peter {{goes out}} with Brian, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe to eat steaks. When Lois finds out, she takes {{him to the}} doctor herself. The doctor pronounces him healthy, but fat. Peter takes this badly, even smashing a picture of Lois' family. Trying to salvage it, Lois discovers another child in the picture: a boy. She {{telephones}} her father Carter, who tells her she doesn't have a brother and quickly terminates the call, but she persists: she breaks into her parents' house.

5|$|The castle, still {{unfinished}} at {{the time}} of Thomas' execution, along with its lands, remained as crown property until it was bestowed on Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, Earl Thomas' brother, in 1327. In turn it passed to Henry's son, the fourth earl, who became the first Duke of Lancaster. At the time of the duke's death in 1361, his constable was Ingram Fauconer, who received an annual life stipend of £10, a further £5 <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife.

5|$|Tolkien {{argues that}} the {{original}} poem has almost been lost {{under the weight of}} the scholarship on it; that Beowulf must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the poem is an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating Grendel and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death fighting the dragon.|$|E

He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E
5|$|Newcastle United {{was set up}} as {{a private}} company limited by shares on 6 September 1895. The club traded in this way {{for much of the}} 20th century, {{dominated}} by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership, until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9% of the club for £3million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a public limited company, with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> business partner Freddy Shepherd. Later that year, Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by John's son Douglas. In December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for £10 million, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the April 1999 Competition Commission, brought in due to government concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.|$|E
