25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got {{in line at}} {{the toll}} booth at the {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> café carrying a large bag and a video camera, but ignored him.|$|E

25|$|Socrates {{then returns}} to {{the myth of the}} chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is {{controlled}} by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

500|$|... "The Mission" [...] {{then looks}} at how Jesus may have been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time. The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms, and [...] "making the unclean clean again". Jesus told lepers to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and ate with sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E
