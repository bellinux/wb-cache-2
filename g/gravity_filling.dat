40|$|All The {{traditional}} foundry {{usually not}} only uses batch melting where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, but also uses the <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> method in both Sand Casting Process (SCP) and Investment Casting Process (ICP). In the <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> operation, the turbulent behaviour of the liquid metal causes substantial entrainment of the surface oxide films which are subsequently trapped into the liquid and generate micro cracks and casting defects. In this paper a new CRIMSON process is introduced which features instead of <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> method, using the single shot up-casting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid filling mould operations which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation. Another advantage of the new process is the drastic reduction of energy consumption due to shortened melting and filling time. Two types of casting samples from SCP and ICP were compared with the new process. The commercial software was used to simulate the filling and solidification processes of the casting samples.

40|$|Cracks in {{concrete}} structures have always posed a big threat on {{the durability of}} concrete. Cracking of concrete is a random process, highly variable and influenced by many factors. Among the crack repair methods {{is the use of}} epoxy either by injection or by <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> in order to bond the crack and restore its structural integrity. Prior to the use of epoxy compounds and due to their versatility and the wide range of available physical and chemical properties of epoxy resin systems, one has to be completely aware and informed before entering the world of epoxies; other than crack repair, epoxy compounds have found a wide variety of uses in the concrete industry. In this study, 15 concrete cubes, six including cracks without repair, six including cracks bonded with gravity filled epoxy and three with no cracks were crushed and their compressive strengths were obtained. It was found that the cracks caused a reduction in compressive strength up to 40. 93 % whereas the epoxy system, when properly applied, restored the compressive strength by decreasing the reduction down to 8. 23 %.

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (US DOE) has {{determined}} that Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F have met the F-Tank Farm (FTF) General Closure Plan Requirements and are ready to be permanently closed. The high-level waste (HLW) tanks have been isolated from FTF facilities. To complete operational closure they will be filled with grout for the purpose of: (1) physically stabilizing the tanks, (2) limiting/eliminating vertical pathways to residual waste, (3) discouraging future intrusion, and (4) providing an alkaline, chemical reducing environment within the closure boundary to control speciation and solubility of select radionuclides. Bulk waste removal and heel removal equipment remain in Tanks 18 -F and 19 -F. This equipment includes the Advance Design Mixer Pump (ADMP), transfer pumps, transfer jets, standard slurry mixer pumps, equipment-support masts, sampling masts, dip tube assemblies and robotic crawlers. The present Tank 18 and 19 -F closure strategy is to grout the equipment in place and eliminate vertical pathways by filling voids in the equipment to vertical fast pathways and water infiltration. The mock-up tests described in this report were intended to address placement issues identified for grouting the equipment that will be left in Tank 18 -F and Tank 19 -F. The Tank 18 -F and 19 -F closure strategy document states {{that one of the}} Performance Assessment (PA) requirements for a closed tank is that equipment remaining in the tank be filled to the extent practical and that vertical flow paths 1 inch and larger be grouted. The specific objectives of the Tier 1 A equipment grout mock-up testing include: (1) Identifying the most limiting equipment configurations with respect to internal void space filling; (2) Specifying and constructing initial test geometries and forms that represent scaled boundary conditions; (3) Identifying a target grout rheology for evaluation in the scaled mock-up configurations; (4) Scaling-up production of a grout mix with the target rheology (16 second flow cone value) from 0. 25 cubic feet to 4. 3 cubic feet. (Ten 0. 43 cubic batches were produced because full-scale equipment was not available for the Tier 1 A test.); (5) Demonstrating continuous <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> of the ADMP mock up test form; (6) Demonstrating continuous <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> of 1 inch and 2 inch schedule 40 pipe; and (7) Demonstrating filling of 1 inch and 2 inch schedule 40 pipe from the bottom up by discharging through a tube inserted into the pipes. The Tier 1 A mock-up test focused on the ADMP and pipes at least one inch in diameter. The ADMP which is located in center riser of Tank 18 -F is a concern because the column for this long-shaft (55 ft) pump is unique and modification to the pump prior to placing it in service limited the flow path options for filling by creating a single flow path for filling and venting the ADMP support column.

40|$|The {{conventional}} foundry {{not only}} frequently uses batch melting, where the aluminium alloys are melted {{and held in}} a furnace for long time, sometimes {{as long as a}} complete shift, but also uses the gravity sand casting process where the molten aluminium alloys are transferred using a ladle from furnace to pour station and are poured into a mould. During the filling of the mould, the turbulent nature of the liquid metal gives rise to massive entrainment of the surface oxide films which are the subsequently trapped into the liquid and act as micro cracks. Also the long exposure time of the liquid surface to the surrounding environment during melting, transferring and filling will increase the level of hydrogen absorption from the atmosphere. The abovementioned factors are often the main reasons for casting defect generation. In this paper the novel CRIMSON aluminium casting method is introduced which has a number of advantages. Instead of <b>gravity</b> <b>filling</b> method, it uses the single shot upcasting method to realize the rapid melting and rapid counter-gravity-filling mould operations which reduce the contact time between the melt and environment thus reducing the possibility of defect generation.

40|$|In {{the upright}} position, <b>gravity</b> <b>fills</b> the {{low-pressure}} systems of human circulation {{with blood and}} interstitial fluid in the sections below the diaphragm. Without gravity one pressure component in the vessels disappears {{and the relationship between}} hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure, which regulates fluid passage across the capillary endothelium in the terminal vascular bed, shifts constantly. The visible consequences of this are a puffy face and "bird" legs. The plasma volume shrinks in space and the range of cardiovascular control is reduced. When they stand up for the first time after landing, 30 - 50 % of astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance. It remains unclear whether microgravity impairs cardiovascular reflexes, or whether it is the altered volume status that causes the cardiovascular instability following space flight. Lower body negative pressure was used in several space missions to stimulate the cardiovascular reflexes before, during and after a space flight. The results show that cardiovascular reflexes are maintained in microgravity. However, the astronauts' volume status changed in space, towards a volume-retracted state, as measurements of fluid-regulating hormones have shown. It can be hypothesized that the control of circulation and body fluid homeostasis in humans is adapted to their upright posture in the Earth's gravitational field. Autonomic control regulates fluid distribution to maintain the blood pressure in that posture, which most of us have to cope with for two-thirds of the day. A determined amount of interstitial volume is necessary to maintain the dynamic range of cardiovascular control in the upright posture; otherwise orthostatic intolerance may occur more often...|$|R

Universally given {{that the universe is}} permeated by a dark energy fluid, therefore, we should also investigate the astrophysical scale properties from the dark energy effects. In the present paper, the exact solutions of spherically-symmetrical Einstein field equations describing wormholes supported by phantom energy that violates the null energy condition from Shan-Chen fluid description are obtained. We have considered the important case that the model parameter ψ≈ 1 which corresponds to the " saturation effect ", and this regime corresponds to an effective form of " asymptotic freedom " for the fluids, but occurring at cosmological rather than subnuclear scales. Then we investigate the allowed range values of the model parameters g and ω when the space-time metrics describe wormholes and discuss the possible singularities of the solutions, finding that the obtained spacetimes are geodesically complete. Moreover, we construct two traversable wormholes through matching our obtained interior solutions to the exterior Schwarzschild solutions and calculate out the total mass of the wormhole when the wormhole throat size r≤ a or r≤ b, respectively.
