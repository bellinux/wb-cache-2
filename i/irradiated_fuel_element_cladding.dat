40|$|Cooling water {{chemistry}} {{and its effects}} on <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> <b>cladding</b> and reactor components materials performance are important factors for safe and reliable operation of nuclear reactors. This is because; at elevated temperature, water is an aggressive medium and may causes corrosion problems in <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> <b>cladding</b> and reactor structural materials. For this reason, reliability and safety for nuclear power and research reactors are achieved by using proper fuel cladding and structural materials. Also, cooling water regimes must be adjusted and proved to prevent dangerous corrosion problems. In this paper, a comparative technical evaluation study among different reactor types concerning cooling water specifications in case of regulatory standard values and operating experience conditions have been investigated. Cooling water specifications for various types of nuclear reactors and impacts of abnormal cooling water quality on reactor materials have been reviewed and discussed. Measures adopted to prevent or decrease water impieties accumulation have been implemented. For further cooling water quality improvements to reduce radiation dose from primary circuits and to achieve higher burnup and better fuel performance, constitution of LWR chemistry guidelines and a new pH control method for primary coolant have been recommended...|$|R
