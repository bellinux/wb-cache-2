40|$|This paper {{details the}} state of {{renewable}} energy development in Tanzania and biomass energy supply and consumption. It also highlights the various levels of renewable energy programmes {{in the country and}} the Government strategy to improve renewable energy production and utilization technologies. A number of problems hindering the development of renewable energy technologies have been identified and discussed. Biomass accounts for 92 % of final energy consumption in Tanzania and will continue to dominate the national energy balance. For example, fuelwood and agricultural residues used to meet domestic energy needs account for 80 % of the domestic energy requirements, while commercial energy such as kerosene, electricity and liquefied petroleum gas account for 1 %. Total biomass resources for 1990 was 27 million tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) from the natural forests. Other major industrial biomass energy sources include sawmill industry, sugarcane plantations, sugar industry by-products, cashew nut industry, coffee industry and sisal industry. The major biomass consumers include woodfuel for <b>domestic</b> use, <b>tobacco</b> production, brick making, tea drying and fish smoking. While there are efforts to develop other renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind and minihydros, there are also problems hindering their development. They include the lack of adequate data on the actual energy potential of these sources as well as the lack of local capability to design and manufacture energy related equipment and spare parts. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Economic Sciences, Washington State UniversityThe second chapter {{examines}} how both <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>tobacco</b> regulations affect {{the flow of}} tobacco trade. I develop a gravity equation incorporating a comprehensive set of <b>domestic</b> and foreign <b>tobacco</b> regulations into a country's tobacco import demand and estimate their bilateral effects. The results suggest a country's tobacco imports are significantly affected by their trading partner's tobacco regulations. There are two important results: spatial regulations reduce tobacco trade regardless of trade direction and marketing regulations in importing countries may actually increase tobacco imports. These results highlight the importance of understand regulations in an increasingly multilateral economy. The third chapter investigates the effects of varying levels of access and excludability on a common pool resource with intrinsic quality characteristics. I analyze the case of deer hunting on leased properties by hunting clubs and estimate the lease size elasticity of both harvest and antler quality. The results suggest lease size has a small but significant effect. For all clubs with smaller than average hunting leases, a simulated increase to the average size results in approximately a 4. 5 {{percent increase in the}} average antler quality of deer harvested. Although I analyze properties leased by hunting clubs, the results are applicable to various other management scenarios. The fourth chapter develops the relationship between excess demand and purchase options. I illustrate a mechanism allowing firms to smooth sales across periods with uncertain quality and increase expected profit over the market clearing strategy. By "underpricing" high quality goods and offering a purchase option guaranteeing a single price regardless of quality, firms create excess demand and increase consumer willingness to pay for their purchase option. The firm maximizes profit by choosing a guaranteed price low enough to create sufficient excess demand and consumer willingness to pay for the purchase option that markets clear when quality is low. Using a numeric example, I demonstrate a case where this behavior increases profit over the market clearing strategy. School of Economic Sciences, Washington State Universit...|$|R

30|$|The {{main reason}} for this {{situation}} is the weak capital power of the regional enterprises, which limits the expenditures on R&D [51]. The unemployment rate in the region equals 13.1 Â % {{in comparison to the}} average unemployment rate of 11.7 Â % in Poland [52]. The main industries of the Podlaskie region are machinery (agricultural machinery), textiles, wood products, and agri-business, including milk and milk processing (the production of butter and fats derived from milk account for 21.3 Â % of <b>domestic</b> production), <b>tobacco</b> and beer production. Machinery and agriculture are also leading in R&D expenditures [51]. Important factors activating the above-mentioned sector are cluster initiatives such as the Metal Processing Cluster, the Podlaskie Food Cluster, the Podlachia Lingerie Cluster, and the North-Eastern Wood Cluster. However, the development of traditional economic sectors contributes to regional economic growth to only a limited extent. Therefore, in order to transform the traditional businesses in Podlaskie province, the Technological foresight NT FOR* Podlaskie 2020 project was carried out with the aim of identifying the key nanotechnology research trajectories, which, applied in a business environment, would boost the economic development of the region.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{lifestyle}} {{risk factors}} for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in North Africa are not known. METHODS: From 2002 to 2005, we interviewed 636 patients and 615 controls from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, frequency-matched by centre, age, sex, and childhood household type (urban/rural). Conditional logistic regression {{was used to evaluate}} the association of lifestyles with NPC risk, controlling for socioeconomic status and dietary risk factors. RESULTS: Cigarette smoking and snuff (tobacco powder with additives) intake were significantly associated with differentiated NPC but not with undifferentiated carcinoma (UCNT), which is the major histological type of NPC in these populations. As demonstrated by a stratified permutation test and by conditional logistic regression, marijuana smoking significantly elevated NPC risk independently of cigarette smoking, suggesting dissimilar carcinogenic mechanisms between cannabis and <b>tobacco.</b> <b>Domestic</b> cooking fumes intake by using kanoun (compact charcoal oven) during childhood increased NPC risk, whereas exposure during adulthood had less effect.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} the direct {{effect of the}} tobacco price support program on domestic cigarette consumption. METHODS: We developed an economic model of demand and supply of US tobacco to estimate how much the price support program increases the price of tobacco. We calculated the resultant increase in cigarette prices from {{the change in the}} tobacco price and the quantity of <b>domestic</b> <b>tobacco</b> contained in US cigarettes. We then assessed the reduction in cigarette consumption attributable to the price support program by applying the estimated increase in the cigarette price to assumed price elasticities of demand for cigarettes. RESULTS: We estimated that the tobacco price support program increased the price of tobacco leaf by $ 0. 36 per pound. This higher tobacco price translates to a $ 0. 01 increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes and an estimated 0. 21 % reduction in cigarette consumption. CONCLUSION: Because the tobacco price support program increases the price of cigarettes minimally, its potential health benefit is likely to be small. The adverse political effect of the tobacco program might substantially outweigh the potential direct benefit of the program on cigarette consumption...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of interest in the study of structural transformation. However, Africa has received little attention despite the fact that its rural areas seem to be very poor and unproductive relative to urban areas. This case study provides a reflection on challenges faced and development strategies adopted by successive governments in Malawi. Malawi is a country with a complex history of rural-urban transformation. On one hand, Malawi has long been, and still is, a predominantly agrarian economy that has seemingly undergone relatively little rural-urban transformation. Malawi is still predominantly rural, most migration is rural-to-rural, and its economic base is heavily dominated by the production of maize (largely for <b>domestic</b> consumption) and <b>tobacco</b> (largely for exports). In this paper we analyze the macroeconomic policy situation and document patterns and trends in Malawiâs rural-urban transformation in a systematic manner. To that end, we focus on a number of dimensions of this transformation, including urban population growth, migration patterns, employment trends, and a spatial analysis of agglomerations and connectivity to major urban centers. We then turn to explain these patterns, largely in terms of colonial, post-independence, and more recent history of agricultural policies. We also examine migration patterns (both rural-urban and rural-rural), and constraints {{on the development of the}} nonfarm sector. In conclusion it becomes apparent that Malawi must diversify its economy to sustain poverty reduction and economic growth. However, it is not clear whether Malawi has an obvious comparative advantage in any sizeable nonfarm sector and how exactly the economic diversification process is to be achieved.
