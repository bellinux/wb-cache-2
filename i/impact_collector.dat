40|$|A {{high-volume}} cascade <b>impact</b> <b>collector</b> (1100 l/min air flow) {{was used}} to collect air samples in an industrial (Port Talbot) and an urban (Cardiff) site {{with the purpose of}} characterising both coarse (PM 10 – 2. 5) and fine (PM 2. 5) fractions comprising the total sample. PM 10 – 2. 5 and PM 2. 5 samples were collected by cascading air through two polyurethane foams on which particles impact and become deposited. Air sample collection rates are to some extent dependent on weather conditions, notably rainfall, humidity, and especially, wind direction, but samples show a very different and distinctive air particle composition between the two collection sites. Thus, although both Cardiff and Port Talbot are coastal sites and therefore have high contents in chlorides, Port Talbot is extremely rich in tiny Fe spherules (> 30 %, in both coarse and fine fractions) from a nearby steel plant. Mineralogical characterisation using SEM-EDX shows a clear fractionation between the particle composition in the PM fractions, with the coarse fraction being dominated by chlorides, sulphates (gypsum), and silicates, and the fine fraction having high proportions of ammonium sulphates and elemental and organic carbon compounds, most of the latter being linked to traffic pollution...|$|E

40|$|Airborne {{microbes}} {{are found}} throughout the troposphere and into the stratosphere. Knowing how the activity of airborne microorganisms can alter water, carbon, and other geochemical cycles is vital to {{a full understanding of}} local and global ecosystems. Just as on the land or in the ocean, atmospheric regions vary in habitability; the underlying geochemical, climatic, and ecological dynamics must be characterized at different scales to be effectively modeled. Most aerobiological studies have focused on a high level: 'How high are airborne microbes found?' and 'How far can they travel?' Most fog and cloud water studies collect from stationary ground stations (point) or along flight transects (1 D). To complement and provide context for this data, we have designed a UAV-based modified fog and cloud water collector to retrieve 4 D-resolved samples for biological and chemical analysis. Our design uses a passive <b>impacting</b> <b>collector</b> hanging from a rigid rod suspended between two multi-rotor UAVs. The suspension design reduces the effect of turbulence and potential for contamination from the UAV downwash. The UAVs are currently modeled in a leader-follower configuration, taking advantage of recent advances in modular UAVs, UAV swarming, and flight planning. The collector itself is a hydrophobic mesh. Materials including Tyvek, PTFE, nylon, and polypropylene monofilament fabricated via laser cutting, CNC knife, or 3 D printing were characterized for droplet collection efficiency using a benchtop atomizer and particle counter. Because the meshes can be easily and inexpensively fabricated, a set can be pre-sterilized and brought to the field for 'hot swapping' to decrease cross-contamination between flight sessions or use as negative controls. An onboard sensor and logging system records the time and location of each sample; when combined with flight tracking data, the samples can be resolved into a 4 D volumetric map of the fog bank. Collected samples can be returned to the lab for a variety of analyses. Based on a review of existing flight studies, we have identified ion chromatography, metagenomic sequencing, cell staining and quantification, and ATP quantification as high-priority assays for implementation. Support for specific toxicology assays, such as methylmercury quantification, is also planned...|$|R

40|$|Lab-scale {{flotation}} {{of copper}} and cobalt oxidized ore from the Luiswishi deposit in the Katanga province (DRC) {{has been done}} focusing {{on the influence of}} the degree of process water recycling on metals recovery. Results have shown that at 20 % recycling rate, the recovery of copper and cobalt in the cleaner stage have been respectively reduced to 23 % and 45 % in comparison to 53 % Cu and 63 % Co if process water has not been recycled. At 10 % recycling rate however, the system could still tolerate the effect from recycling, since Cu and Co recovery has remained respectively at acceptable levels of 52 % and 60 %. In order to explain the reasons for the observed worsening of flotation results if process water was recycled at rate higher than 20 %, electrochemical investigation of the pulp has been performed. It has been established that the chemical compounds formed in the pulp when process water was recycled, do influence the sulfidization of malachite and heterogenite and <b>impact</b> further <b>collector</b> adsorption. To confirm these assumptions, the effect from thiosulphate ions presence during the sulfidization of high purity malachite has been studied.

40|$|Abstract — Sensor {{deployments}} may be static, {{but researchers}} {{have recently been}} making a case for mobile collector nodes to enhance data acquisition. Since mobile nodes are often more privileged, their compromise can give the adversary a significant advantage. Hence, security mechanisms for such networks must tolerate mobile node compromises. Unlike static sensors, which communicate mostly with their neighbors, mobile nodes may communicate with nodes all over the network. Hence, key establishment is a much harder challenge with mobile nodes. We first analyze the <b>impact</b> of mobile <b>collector</b> compromises on the reliability of data received by the base station, and {{the circumstances under which}} reliability can be guaranteed. Second, we present mGKE, a key predistribution scheme for very general group-based sensor deployments. mGKE allows any pair of neighboring sensors to establish a unique pairwise key, regardless of sensor density or distribution. It is also usable by mobile collectors.

40|$|Within museum studies, {{there has}} been a {{tendency}} to assume a distinction between the personal expression of the private individual’s collecting tendencies and the more scientific rationalism of museum accession. The transfer of the collection from private to public property has been seen as an expunging process; as an ideological jump from amateur understanding to professional knowledge; and as the point of the termination of donor impact on collection shape and trajectory. This paper seeks to redress this imbalance, arguing for a closer recognition of the influence of ‘amateur’ collectors and donors on the institutional process of public collection formation. It identifies the continued reliance of museum ‘professionals’ on ‘amateur’ donors for advice about object display, documentation and categorisation after accession. Using relational research on the material collections and archives at Brighton Museum and Art Gallery, Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and the British Museum, the paper explores the <b>impact</b> of <b>collectors</b> Richard Carnac Temple (1850 - 1931) and Edward Horace Man (1846 - 1929) on the professional practice of the museums they came into contact with. Posted in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) as part of their colonial service, these men were enthusiastic amateur anthropologists and serial donors of Andamanese and Nicobarese material culture to museums in the UK (other recipients include the Pitt Rivers Museum, Manchester Museum, Salford Museum and Art Gallery, National Museums Liverpool and National Museums Scotland). Through their communications and gifts, these men are identified as brokers for the exchange and supply of their own and others’ objects, and as influential figures within the distribution of these objects across a nationwide network of museums. They will be shown as two indicative examples of a potentially broader trend in which donor instruction, advice and preference continued to influence the ideological trajectories of public collections which had previously been private, and as individuals who occupy an important space in the blurred historical boundary between amateur passions and professional practice...|$|R
40|$|Even minimal {{improvements}} in particle collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators significantly reduce dust emission from fossil-fuelled power stations and reduce pollution. Yet current designs {{rely on the}} Deutsch collection theory, which was developed for tubular precipitators and {{has been applied to}} wire-plate precipitators {{on the assumption that the}} inter-electrode electric fields at the same discharge distance in both were similar. Differences in geometry and associated collector electric fields and current density non-uniformity have not been taken into account, although the collector electric field and current density of the wire-plate precipitator are not uniform. And observations show that precipitated dust patterns and the distribution of collector current density are interrelated. Investigations revealed a simple square law relationship between the collector electric field and the collector current density in the space charge dominated coronas. Applying this relationship to the Deutsch collection theory led to a current-density-based collection formula that takes into account the non-uniform collector current density distribution. The current-density-based collection formula is then used to assess the <b>impact</b> of <b>collector</b> current density on collection efficiency, the results closely following published measurements. Applying the current-density-based collection formula to estimate the dust accumulation shows that most of the dust accumulates at collector locations facing the corona wires. The effect of the non-uniform precipitated dust layer on collection performance is assessed using the distributed corona impedance - the ratio of the inter-electrode voltage and the non-uniform collector current. Re-distribution of the collector current profile as dust builds up is also compatible with published measurements. Finally this is applied to optimize the wire-plate precipitator collection performance. This shows that optimal collection performance is obtained with the wire-wire spacing less than the wire-plate distance, once again confirming published experimental results. This is the first analytical approach to show better collection performance can be achieved at the ratio of wire-wire spacing/wire-plate distance not equal to unity, which has been the standard industry practice since 1960...|$|R

Scale-up strategies often do not take into account electrical contacts as possible reasons for power loss.

We investigated the electricity production and bacterial anodic development in a 1 L MFC with different electrical contact configurations on its 500 cm² carbon cloth anode. Ohmic resistance due to distance and electron charge transfer resistance due to potential drop distribution on the anode were thought to limit power production by shaping and restricting spatial development of microbes.

Taking the widely studied oxidative dissolution of individual silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as an important example, we present measurements with unprecedented noise (< 5 pA) and time resolution (time constant 100 μs) that are highly revealing of Ag NP dissolution dynamics.

Detailed quantitative analysis of the I–t features, consumed charge, event duration and impact frequency leads to a major conclusion: Ag NPs undergo sequential partial stripping (oxidative dissolution) events, where a fraction of a NP is electrochemically oxidized, followed by the NP drifting away and back to the tunnelling region before the next partial stripping event. As a consequence, analysis of the charge consumed by single events (so-called “impact coulometry”) cannot be used as a general method to determine the size of colloidal NPs.

The dust coma is characterized by "swarms" and "bursts" of particles with large variations of flux on small spatial scales, which {{may be explained by}} jets and fragmentation. The mass of the dust coma is dominated by larger particles, as was found for comets 1 P/Halley and 26 P/Grigg-Skjellerup. However, almost 80 % of the particles were detected many minutes after closest approach at a distance of ~ 4000 km, where small grains dominated the detected mass flux. The mass distribution varies on small spatial scales with location in the coma, consistent with the jets and fragmentation inferred from the highly heterogeneous dust spatial distribution. The cumulative mass distribution index α (where the number of particles of mass m or larger, N (m) α m -α) in the coma ranges from 0. 3 to 1. 1.

40|$|The {{delivery}} of amino acids {{to the early}} Earth by comets and their fragments {{could have been a}} significant source of the early Earth's prebiotic organic inventory that led to the emergence of life (Chyba and Sagan, 1992). Over 20 organic molecules including methane, ethane, ammonia, cyanic acid, formaldehyde, formamide, acetaldehyde, acetonitrile, and methanol have been identified by radio spectroscopic observations of the comae of comets Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake (Crovisier et al. 2004). These simple molecules could have provided the organic reservoir to allow the formation of more complex prebiotic organic compounds such as amino acids. After a 7 -year mission, the Stardust spacecraft returned to Earth samples from comet Wild 2 on January 15, 2006 providing the opportunity to analyze the organic composition and isotopic distribution of cometary material with state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation. The Preliminary Examination Team analyses of organics in samples returned by Stardust were largely focused on particles that <b>impacted</b> the <b>collector</b> aerogel and aluminum foil (Sandford et al. 2006). However, {{it is also possible that}} Stardust returned a "diffuse" sample of gas-phase organic molecules that struck the aerogel directly or diffused away from the grains after impact. To test this possibility, samples of Stardust flight aerogel and foil were carried through a hot water extraction and acid hydrolysis procedure to see if primary amine compounds were present in excess of those seen in controls. Here we report highly sensitive liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry measurements of amino acids and amines in samples returned from a comet (Glavin et al. 2008). A suite of amino acids and amines including glycine, L-alanine, methylamine (MA), and ethylamine (EA) were identified in the Stardust bulk aerogel. With the exception of MA and EA, all other primary amines detected in comet-exposed aerogels were also present in the aerogel witness tile that was not exposed to Wild 2, suggesting that most amines are terrestrial in origin. However, the enhanced abundances of MA, EA, and possibly glycine in comet-exposed aerogel compared to controls, coupled with MA to EA ratios (1 to 2) that are distinct from preflight aerogels (7 to 10), suggest that these amines were captured from Wild 2. It is possible that MA and EA were formed on energetically processed icy grains containing methane, ethane, and ammonia. The presence of cometary amines in Stardust material supports the hypothesis that comets were an important source of prebiotic organics on the early Earth. To better understand their origin, a systematic compound specific carbon isotopic analysis (C-CSIA) via gas chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry in with parallel with combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GCQMS/ IRMS) is being conducted. We will discuss our latest C-CSIA measurements and what they indicate about the origin of amino acids extracted from Stardust samples...|$|R
40|$|Interplanetary dust {{particles}} (IDPs) {{collected in the}} stratosphere are dust from comets and asteroids that have arrived in the Earth’s stratosphere via Poynting-Robertson effect after being ejected from their parent body. Chondritic porous IDPs display a range of features indicative of a very primitive nature and are generally believed to originate from comets. While our knowledge is somewhat limited about the internal and near-surface processes affecting non-ice materials within a cometary body, those processes that have occurred will have been different, and probably less pervasive compared to those occurring on the asteroidal meteorite parent bodies. The abundant organic material present in primitive IDPs {{may be the result}} of formation processes that occurred across a large volume of the protoplanetary disk. However, the study of organic material in particles only a few to a few tens of microns across is challenging. Laser Raman microscopy offers a rapid and potentially non-destructive approach for determining some important general characteristics of the organic matter in IDPs. While a number of studies have been conducted to date, the number of IDPs analysed remains relatively small (a few dozen) – particularly when the number of potential parent bodies is considered or the huge volume of the protoplanetary disk that may have contributed to the formation of comets. Nine IDPs were selected at the Cosmic Dust Laboratory at Johnson Space Center from five large cluster particles on collectors L 2005 and L 2006. Cluster particles represent large IDPs that broke into smaller pieces on <b>impact</b> with the <b>collector.</b> These particles can be > 100 μm across but the individual particles within them are typically 5 - 15 μm in size. This offers the opportunity to investigate the variability of the Raman signature of the organic matter on a number of scales. This study is the first part of a larger, on-going project integrating the Raman, mineralogy (ASEM) and isotopic signatures (NanoSIMS) of the particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and fate of particles including microorganisms during physico-chemical filtration in natural and engineered aquatic environments remains essential for effective and sustainable drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation, {{as well as}} understanding and assessing the risk of environmental contamination of water supplies. The development of models to predict particle deposition by physico-chemical filtration has been ongoing since the 1960 ’s. What is now considered classical colloid filtration theory (CFT) {{was developed in the}} 1970 ’s to predict particle removal during granular media filtration used for drinking water treatment. More recently, CFT has been applied to various applications related to subsurface particle and microbial {{transport and}} fate, including riverbank filtration, aquifer storage and recovery, bioremediation, and assessment of contaminant transport and fate. Significant discrepancies between predictions of particle deposition from current CFT models and experimental observations have been reported. While several model variations of CFT have been reported, models focusing on integration of <b>impacts</b> of <b>collector</b> surface geometry and physically-based mechanisms such as hydrodynamics have been rarely reported. The overall goal of this work was to describe and evaluate the contribution of media grain (collector) surface roughness on particle removal by physico-chemical filtration. Four phases of experiments were conducted to investigate the impacts of surface roughness on particle deposition in porous media and parallel plate systems. Bench scale “proof of concept” experiments (Phase I) were conducted using small filtration columns, two sizes of colloidal particles (1. 0 and 4. 5 μm diameter polystyrene microspheres), two sizes of glass beads (0. 71 to 0. 85 mm and 0. 5 to 0. 595 mm), and three different levels of surface roughness. The experiments demonstrated that surface roughness not only enhanced particle deposition, but also decreased it. Classic colloid filtration theory, chemical heterogeneity, and hydrophobicity fail to explain this non-linear, non-monotonic impact of surface roughness on particle deposition; particularly decreased deposition resulting from increased surface roughness. The results indicated the existence of a minimum particle deposition efficiency that is unique to each combination of sizes of colloidal particle, collector, and collector roughness. To verify this research finding, particle deposition experiments were conducted using a parallel plate chamber (Phase II) to further confirm and characterize the contribution of surface roughness to particle deposition. The impacts of different nano-scale quartz surface roughness sizes (10, 20, 50, 200 and 400 nm) on deposition kinetics of three sizes (0. 55, 0. 985 and 1. 765 μm) of polystyrene microspheres suspended in 100 mM KCl were examined. A non-linear, non-monotonic relationship between surface roughness and particle deposition flux was again observed. A critical roughness size associated with a minimum deposition flux was identified for the experimental conditions investigated. A numerical model approach incorporating the effect of surface roughness on flow field profile, hydrodynamic retardation functions, and DLVO interaction energy was developed for a parallel plate chamber system (Phase III). Key physical and chemical properties of the flow field, colloids and the modified rough surface were precisely measured and utilized in the simulation. Changes to the flow field, the hydrodynamic retardation functions, and the DLVO interaction energy due to the presence of nano-scale collector surface roughness were implemented in the developed model. The numerical solutions obtained using the developed model had excellent agreement with the experimental results obtained in research Phase II. This work provided a mathematical framework that was more applicable to real practice by including the effect of the collector surface roughness on particle deposition. The importance of the gravity effect was identified, underscoring the importance of precise measurements of particle size and density for model development. The verified model framework developed for a parallel plat chamber in Phase III was extended to spherical geometry and utilized to simulate particle deposition behavior in porous media in Phase IV. Functions that were validated in Phase III for the flow field profile, the hydrodynamic retardation functions, and the DLVO interaction energy were utilized. Various operational scenarios including particle size, loading rate and ionic strength were investigated. The Phase IV results could also be used to explain experimental results observed in the porous media experiments (Phase I). It was found that the presence of nano-scale surface roughness was able to improve the particle deposition on spherical collectors; the enhancement became more significant when roughness element height increased. Overall, this work demonstrated that nano-scale surface roughness and associated hydrodynamics can impact on particle deposition. These impacts can and should be incorporated into predictive mathematical models of clean bed colloidal particle deposition. 1 yea...|$|R
