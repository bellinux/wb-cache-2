5|$|All of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point {{ammunition}} {{is classified}} as category A (see above). The alternative to a <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.|$|E
5|$|Includes full {{automatic}} firearms, military firearms and ammunition not inspected and marked for civilian use, {{some types of}} ammunition such as armor-piercing and incendiary ammunition, night vision scopes, suppressors. The use of <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> ammunition in pistols is also restricted, however, hollow points are legal to purchase for rifles and pistol carbines.|$|E
5|$|The SS192 was {{discontinued}} in late 2004. It used a 1.8g (28grain) <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> bullet with {{a copper}} jacket and an aluminum core. The projectile had {{a length of}} 21.6mm (.85in). It had an unmarked hollow nose with a depth of 7.6mm (0.3in) and a 0.8-mm (0.03in) opening. The SS192 was classified by the ATF as not armor-piercing, and in testing by FNH USA it did not penetrate a Level IIIA vest when fired from the Five-seven.|$|E

30|$|The {{situation}} {{during a}} steady-state pore growth {{must be considered}} to explain the effect of self-organization. By applying voltage between the anode electrode and cathode electrode on the aluminum surface, a layer of flat oxide surface is produced and proceeds with the dissolution of some oxide area (surface defects) within the electrolyte, and with the dissolution tendency of the oxide layer of primary <b>hollow</b> <b>points,</b> holes are created on the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Cartridges for [...]17 HMR {{come with}} bullets that weigh , , and , {{and come in}} designs such as polymer (ballistic) tipped, <b>hollow</b> <b>points,</b> soft points, and FMJ. The {{terminal}} ballistics of the lightweight expanding bullets limit the [...]17 HMR to small game animals and varmints[...]17 HMR ammunition is less common and {{more expensive than the}} [...]22 caliber rimfire rounds, but this is changing as the popularity of [...]17 HMR rifles gathers momentum.|$|R
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd), posing greater risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss. This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous. Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a <b>hollow</b> <b>point,</b> the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
25|$|While {{originally}} {{sold only}} to handloaders as an inexpensive substitute for jacketed bullets, the plated bullet has come far. The ammunition manufacturer Speer now offers the Gold Dot line, commercially loaded premium handgun ammunition using copper-plated <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> bullets. The strong bond between jacket and core {{created by the}} electroplating process makes expanding bullets hold together very well, and the Gold Dot line is now in use by many police departments.|$|E
25|$|Commonly {{referred}} {{to parts of}} a fish hook are: its point - the sharp end that penetrates the fish's mouth or flesh; the barb - the projection extending backwards from the point, that secures the fish from unhooking; the eye - {{the end of the}} hook that is connected to the fishing line or lure; the bend and shank - that portion of the hook that connects the point and the eye; and the gap - the distance between the shank and the point. In many cases, hooks are described by using these various parts of the hook. Example: Wide gap, 2X Long Shank, <b>Hollow</b> <b>Point,</b> Turned Down Ring Eye Bait hook.|$|E

50|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of a bullet, meplat design and materials are engineered. The meplat designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; <b>hollow</b> <b>pointed</b> which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow punched hole {{in the end of}} a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze with tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight.|$|R
5000|$|Work at Johns Hopkins University in the 1950s {{led to the}} {{development}} of the direct injection antipersonnel chemical biological agent (DIACBA), where flechettes were grooved, <b>hollow</b> <b>pointed,</b> or otherwise milled to retain a quantity of chemical biological warfare agent [...] to be delivered through a ballistic wound. The initial work was with the nerve agent VX, which had to be thickened to deliver a reliable dose. Eventually this was replaced by a particulate carbamate. The US Biological Program also had a microflechette to deliver either botulinum toxin A or saxitoxin, the M1 biodart, which resembled a 7.62 mm rifle cartridge.|$|R
25|$|The Action 4.6×30mm Law Enforcement {{cartridge}} weighs 6.5 g and {{is loaded}} with a 2 g CuZn-alloy (brass) Solid <b>Hollow</b> <b>Point</b> projectile that achieves 700m/s (2,300ft/s) muzzle velocity. The cartridge is designed for the MP7. This ammunition is optimized for energy transfer in soft targets and should offer decent penetration performance on hard and combined targets like car doors or glass and body armour. The muzzle velocity V0 and V50 indicate a G1 ballistic coefficient of approximately 0.112 to 0.119 (BC's are somewhat debatable). At the stated effective range of 200m the 2g Action projectile will be travelling at approximately Mach 1.67 (586m/s) under ICAO Standard Atmosphere conditions at sea level (air density ρ = 1.225 kg/m3).|$|E

50|$|The RPG-6 was {{designed}} as a replacement for the RPG-43. The RPG-43 had a large warhead, but {{was designed}} to detonate in contact with a tank's armour; it was later found that optimal performance was gained from a HEAT warhead if it exploded a short distance from the armour, roughly the same distance as the weapon's diameter. In the RPG-6 this was achieved by adding a <b>hollow</b> <b>pointed</b> nose section with the impact fuse in it, so that when the weapon detonated the warhead was at the optimum distance from the armour. The weapon was a success and went into mass production, being used alongside the RPG-43 in many countries long after the war.|$|R

2500|$|Dr. Wecht {{based his}} {{opinion on the}} fact that Workman was using a [...]45 caliber gun and <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> {{ammunition}} and that such bullets fired from such a gun more than 90% of the time do not pass through the body but remain within the shooting victim. Dr. Wecht's professional opinion was that when <b>hollow</b> <b>point</b> ammunition fired from a [...]45 caliber gun does pass through the body of the victim, the exit wound is almost always larger than the entry wound. According to medical examiner Dr. James Bell, the exit wound on Lt. Oliver's body was smaller than the entry wound.

40|$|High-speed video {{has emerged}} as an {{valuable}} tool for quantifying bullet performance in ballistic gelatin.

Though. 357 SIG bullets perform slightly better due to higher impact energy, the principal finding {{is that there is a}} much bigger difference in performance between the best and worst performing bullets in each cartridge than there is between bullets of similar design in the two cartridges. In each cartridge, higher performing expanding bullets (jacketed <b>hollow</b> <b>points)</b> outperform non-expanding bullets (full metal jacket) by a wide margin, showing a much higher probability of rapid incapacitation according to an Army Research Laboratory model by Neades and Prather (1991).
