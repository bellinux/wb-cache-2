2500|$|Past {{comments}} {{came back}} to haunt Goldwater throughout the campaign. He had once called the Eisenhower administration [...] "a dime-store New Deal", and the former president never fully forgave him. Eisenhower did, however, film a television commercial with Goldwater. Eisenhower qualified his voting for Goldwater in November by remarking that he had voted not specifically for Goldwater, but for the Republican Party. In December 1961, Goldwater had told a news conference that [...] "sometimes I think this country {{would be better off}} <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea".

40|$|Abstract. The {{perceived}} {{success of}} recent visual recognition approaches {{has largely been}} derived from their performance on classification tasks, where all possible classes are known at training time. But what about open set problems, where unknown classes appear at test time? Intuitively, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> accurately model <b>just</b> the positive data for any known class without overfitting, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> reject the large set of unknown classes even under an assumption of incomplete class knowledge. In this paper, we formulate the problem as one of modeling positive training data at the decision boundary, where we can invoke the statistical extreme value theory. A new algorithm called the PI-SVM is introduced for estimating the unnormalized posterior probability of class inclusion. ...|$|R
