5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave <b>impinging</b> on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the <b>impinging</b> wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

40|$|The test {{specimens}} of NiCrBSi coating were prepared using the high velocity oxy-fuel spraying technique with a post-thermal treatment. Their high-speed slurry erosion characteristics have been systematically studied. SUS {{304 stainless steel}} {{was selected as the}} comparison material. Experimental results show that the NiCrBSi sprayed coating exhibits a much better slurry erosion resistance than the SUS 304 stainless steel. The erosion rate for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating slightly increases with the <b>impinged</b> angle. However, a maximum erosion rate appears at an <b>impinged</b> angle of around 30 degrees for SUS 304 stainless steel. Both NiCrBSi sprayed coating and SUS 304 stainless steel exhibit <b>impinged</b> surfaces with lots of furrows at an <b>impinged</b> angle of 30 degrees. At a high <b>impinged</b> angle of 90 degrees, the SUS 304 stainless steel exhibits an <b>impinged</b> surface with lots of overlapping and irregular concavities, while, these features are less obvious for NiCrBSi sprayed coating. The hardness of SUS 304 stainless steel increases significantly with increasing <b>impinged</b> angle during the high-speed slurry erosion. But, there is no obvious work hardening for the NiCrBSi sprayed coating due to its extra-high hardness and less plastic deformation, even at a high <b>impinged</b> angle of 90 degrees.

5|$|Although {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed for}} the uninhibited growth of Iselle early in its development, moderate wind shear briefly impacted the hurricane on August2, preventing thunderstorms from intensifying and causing the storm to become slightly malformed vertically. However, these conditions abated shortly afterwards, allowing Iselle to resume strengthening and reach Category2hurricane status late that same day. With wind shear no longer <b>impinging</b> on the organization of Iselle, the tropical cyclone gradually became more symmetric, allowing for the hurricane's once ragged eye to clear itself of cloud cover and the storm to intensify to major hurricane status on August3. Attaining some annular tropical cyclone characteristics, Iselle reaching Category4 strength at 12:00UTC on August4. Consequently, Iselle reached peak intensity at 18:00UTC with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). At the same time, the hurricane exhibited an 30mi (45km) eye across.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katia was {{a classic}} Cape Verde {{hurricane}} that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an <b>impinging</b> cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

In 2004, the RIKEN team also studied the 205Tl(70Zn,n)274Rg reaction, retaining the zinc beam and <b>impinging</b> it on a thallium rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce 274Rg in a cross-bombardment as the immediate daughter of 278Nh. However, the thallium target was weak compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness; hence no atoms of 274Rg were observed. This reaction was repeated in 2010 with upgraded equipment, but again without success. The reasons for this weakness are still unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth.|$|E
5|$|Upon peaking in intensity, Julia {{accelerated}} {{slightly as}} it re-curved toward the northwest along a mid to upper-level low to its southwest. In addition, this system generated unfavorable southerly flow aloft, inducing a slight {{weakening of the}} storm. By early September16, Julia's eye became indistinguishable on satellite images, and the storm further dropped to below major hurricane status. Upon doing so, Julia became embedded within a south-southeasterly steering current along deep-layer ridging in its vicinity, resulting in a more westward track. Though still a hurricane, the relatively small tropical system moved {{to the east of}} the much larger Hurricane Igor. Concurrently, Igor's outflow began <b>impinging</b> on Julia's circulation, and due to colder sea surface temperatures, the storm weakened below hurricane intensity late on September17. Henceforth, Julia re-accelerated as it further curved northward around the contiguous ridge, nearly merging with Igor as a result. Progressively tracking to the north over the next hours, Julia subsequently executed a turn to the northeast, then to the east. Proceeding eastward, the low-level center of the storm became partially exposed on September 18; however, for several hours thereafter, convection gradually redeveloped over its center. Despite the deep convection, vertical wind shear again increased over the system, causing the storm to enter an extratropical transition. It is estimated Julia degenerated into a post-tropical low by 1800 UTC on September 20, while located about 1095mi (1750km) west of the Azores. The resultant storm meandered around over the Atlantic for several days, continuing generally eastward before executing an elongated loop to the south. Following this erratic track, the remnants of Hurricane Julia proceeded northwestward and came within 350mi (563km) of Bermuda, where they were once again briefly monitored by the NHC. However, chance of redevelopment dwindled, as conditions were not conducive for tropical formation; convection nearly diminished entirely, and the NHC discontinued monitoring the system on September 28.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this two-year study was to document the occurrence of impingement and entrainment of fishes at two of Dairyland Power Cooperative's cooling water intakes on Navigation Pool 5 of the Upper Mississippi River during 1979 and 1980. Impingement at the 208 MW Alma units 1 - 5 intake during 1979 - 1980 consisted of 33 species from 13 families. During 1979 sampling, 586 fishes were <b>impinged.</b> During 1980 sampling at Alma 1 - 5, 1165 fishes were <b>impinged.</b> The weekly 24 -hour impingement samples were used to project the two-year annual mean impingement of 10, 735 fishes. Gizzard shad(40. 0 %) and black crappie (23. 1 %) were the most commonly <b>impinged</b> species during the study. The annual entrainment of larval fishes at Alma 1 - 5 was estimated at 125, 000 during 1980. Impingement studies at the 350 MW J. P. Madgett Station intake began with its operation in November 1979 and continued through 1980. IMring sampling, 29 species from 9 families were <b>impinged,</b> including 3 crystal darters (ammocrypta asprella), which had not been previously recorded in Pool 5. A total of 3980 <b>impinged</b> fishes were sampled during the 11 months of the study. The weekly 24 -hour impingement samples were used to project the total impingement of 33, 791 fishes for the J. P. Madgett intake during the study period. Gizzard shad comprised 63. 8 % of the total numbers and 14. 0 % were freshwater drum. Annual variations in impingement were attributed to varying densities of juvenile fishes {{in the vicinity of}} the intakes. This was likely influenced primarily by spawning success. Over 90 % of all fishes <b>impinged</b> were juveniles. A fish mortality study at the J. P. Madgett intake showed that survival of <b>impinged</b> fishes was species-specific. Survival of all fishes <b>impinged</b> during sampling was 16. 6 %. The efficiency of removal of fishes from the fish trays on the vertical traveling screens by the low pressure spray jets was calculated to be approximately 96 %. The combined estimated total biomass of fishes <b>impinged</b> at both intakes during 1980 represented approximately 0. 4 % by weight of the total annual harvest of Pool 5. Both intake structures were located in areas that were not conducive to high fish densities. Differences between impingement rates at the two intake structures was likely due, in part, to the larger surface area and greater intake volume at the J. P. Madgett intake...|$|R
