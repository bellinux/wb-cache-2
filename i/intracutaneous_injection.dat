Methods: Between March 2002 and June 2005, 10 consecutive patients with severe gustatory sweating were managed with <b>intracutaneous</b> <b>injection</b> of botulinum toxin type A for a total of 16 times. The affected skin was visualized by Minor's starch-iodine test and then recorded. The interinjection distance was 1 cm and a mean dose of 46. 4 U (at a concentration of 2. 5 U/ 0. 1 mL) was used. Results: In all 10 cases, gustatory sweating improved within 2 days after injection, with no side effects. Patients in whom the first 13 injections were performed experienced recurrence of gustatory sweating. Mean duration of effectiveness was 9. 3 months; the shortest duration of effectiveness was 2 months and the longest was 28 months.
