5|$|In 2008, {{advances}} in DNA analysis allowed {{a more detailed}} study of the fisher's evolutionary history. It was determined that the fisher and the Martes genera were descended from a common ancestor but the fisher was distinct <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in its own genera. It was decided to create the Pekania genera and reclassify the fisher as Pekania pennanti.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it {{to the left of}} the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he could shoot.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in a good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
25|$|The Labour Party chose {{author and}} {{broadcaster}} John O'Farrell as its candidate on 12 February. Having received {{during the campaign}} negative coverage of selected quotations from a book he wrote in 1998, in which he recalled the Brighton bomb attacks against the Conservative Party and then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, O'Farrell reflected after polling day that the experience was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him off electoral politics for good.|$|E

25|$|The 1986–87 season {{represented}} {{a step back}} for the Warriors as the team won just 10 games, but remarkably it was good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them in the playoffs as the Summerland Buckaroos finished with nine points fewer in last place in both the BCJHL and the Interior Division.

25|$|Many of Wan Chai's older {{buildings}} {{now face}} {{a serious problem}} of urban decay. To tackle the problem, the government has launched a series of urban renewal projects to bring {{new life into the}} area.

Other concerns involve the loss of building character that make up part of that Hong Kong cultural identity.|$|E
25|$|One {{a serious}} rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Yusuf. Exiled in Cairo {{during the early}} 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab {{nationalism}} associated with the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser. Yet {{as a result of}} his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> 20,000 yusufists into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, {{do not know how to}} determine what is real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E
25|$|Covered by {{only four}} riflemen, he fought {{for four hours}} under terrific enemy small-arms fire and {{repeatedly}} returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently {{to the rear of}} hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, a wisp of smoke alerted him to the air vent of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.|$|E
25|$|Sorokina {{remained}} highly {{ranked in}} the 1982 season, including a lifetime best in the 800m of 1:56.6 minutes (placing her seventh on the year's rankings). She again ran below four minutes for the 1500m and her best of 3:59.24 minutes though slower than the previous year was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her in the season's top ten. A Soviet trio of Sorokina, Olga Dvirna and Zamira Zaytseva were entered into the 1500m for the 1982 European Athletics Championships. Her compatriots took the top two spots, but Sorokina failed to produce her season's best and finished in sixth place. This {{proved to be the}} last high-profile international appearance that she made. In her last year of competition in 1983 she ranked sixth in the world for the 1500m.|$|E

25|$|Reforming the Constitution {{was one of}} {{the main}} pledges of the AKP during the 2007 {{election}} campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a Constitutional Commission (Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu). The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to instantly become law, but secured 336 votes in the 550 seat parliament – <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the proposals to a referendum. The reform package included a number of issues such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the ombudsman's office, the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract, gender equality, the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military, the right of civil servants to go on strike, a privacy law, and the structure of the Constitutional Court. The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.|$|E
25|$|The {{show was}} filmed in over 25 {{countries}} for over 150 weeks. Season one was shot from March 1991 to March 1992; {{the second season}} began two months later and wrapped in April 1993. The ABC network was unsure of Lucas's cerebral approach, and attempted to advertise the series as an action-adventure like the films. Ratings were good if unspectacular, and ABC was nervous <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the show on hiatus after six episodes until September 1992. With only four episodes left of the second season to air, ABC eventually sold the show to the Family Channel, who changed the format from 50-minute episodes to 90-minute TV movies. Filming for the final four episodes took place from January 1994 to May 1996. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles received a mixed reception from fans, although it won 10 Emmy Awards out of 23 nominations, {{as well as a}} 1994 Golden Globe nomination for Best Drama series. It was also an experimentation ground in digital effects for Lucasfilm.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by three consecutive losses {{in the first round}} of qualifying for WTA events before Baltacha won two matches to qualify for the Rogers Cup, a Premier tournament. She faced former world number 1, Kim Clijsters, in the second tournament of her comeback and lost to the Belgian in straight sets. Following this, she reached the final round of qualifying for the US Open before going on to win the $75,000 ITF in Shrewsbury. She beat fellow Brit, Katie O'Brien, in the final. This result was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> both finalists into the top 100 for the first time in each of their careers. After this, Baltacha reached the semifinals of one more $50,000 ITF, the second round of a $100,000 ITF (where she had to withdraw due to food poisoning) and the quarterfinals of a $75,000 ITF tournament. These showings helped her accumulate enough points to catapult her back to the British number 1 spot. Her year-end ranking was world number 87.|$|E

25|$|The Big Show wasn't quite big <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{television}} {{in its place}} and keep it there. NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep it alive longer than two years might also {{have been due to}} the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including The Jack Benny Program (directly opposite The Big Show), Amos 'n' Andy and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. But The Big Show is remembered {{as one of the great}} final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} forms of {{dismissal}} are bowled, when the bowler hits the stumps {{directly with the}} ball and dislodges the bails; leg before wicket (lbw), when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat; and caught, when the batsman hits {{the ball into the}} air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground. Runs are scored by two main methods: either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the boundary, or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball. If a fielder retrieves the ball quickly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> down the wicket with a batsman not having reached the crease at that end of the pitch, that batsman is dismissed (a run out occurs). Adjudication is performed on the field by two umpires; they communicate with two off-field scorers (one per team) who record all the match's statistical information including runs, dismissals, overs, etc.|$|E
