500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E

40|$|ISSUE: 	 Should the Council {{update the}} {{municipal}} code to more effectively and more clearly address {{issues related to}} sidewalks and street trees? BACKGROUND: 	 In recent months (and as is typical this time of year), the public works department has received a number of inquiries, complaints and comments regarding dangerous trees and/or damaged sidewalks. The city has long responded to such issues by telling the adjoining property owners that they are responsible to repair and maintain both the sidewalks and street trees that abut their property. The basis for this response is SWMC 12. 28 for sidewalks and SWMC 12. 40 for street trees and planting strips, landscaping, etc. The questions we are presenting for the city council's considerations are: 1. <b>How</b> do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> address the repair and maintenance of sidewalks, 2. <b>How</b> do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> manage the liability that flows from known damaged sidewalks, and 3. <b>How</b> do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> address the maintenance of street trees and other landscaping that protrudes into the rights-of-way. SIDEWALKS: Our city's law on sidewalks was adopted in 1913 {{and has not been}} updated since. SWMC 12. 28. 010 reads as follows: Whenever any street, lane, square, place, or alley in the city shall have been improved by the construction of a sidewalk or sidewalks, along either or both sides thereof, the duty, burden and expense of maintenance, repai...|$|R
