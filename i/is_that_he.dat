5|$|After the {{introduction}} which shows parts of Cord's missions, the game {{starts with a}} scene in which Cord is interrogated by now premier Dmitri Nagarov, while he is being tortured by his assistant Lukyan. After the torture, Cord is fighting for his sanity, and all he knows for sure <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was betrayed. He tries to piece together the fragments of his memory, and the player must reconstruct the events that led to his capture.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on {{the connection between the}} past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
50|$|At times, Berry offered two {{different}} explanations for his actions. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> killed Mitroff for revenge for almost running over Berry's sister with the delivery van, {{while the other}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> killed him for no special reason.|$|R

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is no longer}} misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|Asuma is a male wizard with a {{frivolous}} {{personality and}} {{is the director of}} Kamisaid Magic Academy. He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear out of nowhere. His sacrifice for magic <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was surprised he had aged a few years in one day.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, I have herein {{told you}} with great particularity all these {{circumstances}} of his early history so that you may know exactly how it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken away into the lake, and why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afterward known as Sir Launcelot, surnamed of the Lake.|$|R
60|$|It might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{accustomed}} to live {{alone with his}} retainers, and <b>that</b> his manners <b>were</b> rude and coarse to all. It might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a special hostility to the English. At any rate, his remarks were calculated to fire the anger of the earl.|$|R

5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|He {{was educated}} in the Episcopal Church, to which he always adhered; and my {{conviction}} <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed in the fundamental doctrines of Christianity as usually taught in that Church, according to his understanding of them; but without a particle of intolerance, or disrespect for the faith and modes of worship adopted by Christians of other denominations.|$|E
50|$|Mori gives several reasons, {{in various}} interviews, {{as to why}} he started to write while working as {{associate}} professor. One of the reasons <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> saying jokingly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would become a writer by forty, and another, already mentioned above, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to have another source of income for his hobbies. However, the direct cause <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mori simply wanted to impress his daughter who was a big fan of mystery novels.|$|R

He secures a lease from Mrs. Sanderson to occupy the mansion {{for the duration of}} his investigation; conditional to his acceptance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> take Luke Sanderson, her heir, with him. Markway has chosen two individuals to accompany him—a psychic, Theodora, also known as Theo, and the meek Eleanor Lance, who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.|$|E
5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model saw himself as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed {{a strong sense of}} German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E
5|$|One {{commonly}} held misconception connected to Dyer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> holds the second longest unbeaten record of fights of any boxer in world history, after fellow Welsh fighter Jimmy Wilde. This information {{was published in}} Nat Fleischer's The Ring: Record Book And Boxing Encyclopedia, in which it states Dyer fought 94 unbeaten fights between 1908 and 1912. Although {{it could be argued}} that Dyer may have boxed 94 fights between these years, and may have turned professional in 1908, it is widely accepted that his fight with Dick Emden in 1911 in which he dislocated his knee was a loss. This therefore challenges Fleischer's claim.|$|E

5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. One reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> faked his death.

5|$|The Joker has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The Joker falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the Joker was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, the Annals of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. The Annals of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 1054, as recorded by the Annals of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be evidence to suggest that, when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E
5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. One possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was attempting to}} establish Norwegian authority in the west {{as a means to}} prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

In this episode, Reverend Orison releases Donnie Pfaster, Scully's former kidnapper, from jail {{in the hopes of}} passing judgment on him. What he discovers instead <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has released pure evil, and it’s headed for Scully.|$|E
