The research concentrated on the load of petrochemical waste waters. Borealis’ Petrochemical plants consist of cracker, butadiene, benzene, cumene and phenol plants. There are two waste water systems in Borealis Polymers Petrochemical plants: phenolic waters (PW) and oily waters (OW) which were studied separately. The phenol plant discharges its waste water to both systems, while other plants discharge only to OW-system. The loads of waste waters were assessed with two methods. The first method was chemical oxygen demand and the second method {{was to assess the}} quality of waste water streams from plants. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was studied with theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) analysis. The quality of different waste water streams were assessed by taking samples from waste waters generated in the plants. In phenolic waters, the ThOD was mostly caused by methanol and phenol. In OW-system the contribution to COD-load was divided more equally between all the components found in the waste waters. Petrochemical waste waters contain a variety of different components, so ThOD analysis based only on known components did not give a full answer how different sorts of chemicals contribute to COD. On average the determined ThOD was one fifth of measured in COD in phenolic waters and one third of measured COD in oily waters. In the phenol plant the load originated from the <b>effluent</b> <b>stripper</b> and methylhydroperoxide (MHP) reactor to the phenolic waters. When the quality of waste waters was studied, the MHP-reactor was the main contributor to the load to biological treatment feed, biolsy. It is recommended that the known components should be analysed also from the outlet of the MHP-reactor continuously. The waste water from the MHP-reactor contained high concentrations of cumene and phenol. Also because of the high phenol and cumene content of the water, it should be treated either in <b>effluent</b> <b>stripper</b> or in the OW-stripper. The cracker was responsible for benzene, toluene, xylenes and phenol load to oily waters system. The phenol and aromatics were responsible for methanol, and total nitrogen load. The known components should be continuously analysed from all the main waste water sources; the diluting steam generator, the NaOH and FCC washing steps, the carbonyl wash, the OW-stripper and the ejector waters. The streams that contained high hydrocarbon concentrations should be treated in OW-stripper and streams that contained phenol should be treated in <b>effluent</b> <b>stripper.</b> The reduction of load is difficult even impossible if the reduction concentrates only on the total load, measured either from pit 27 in case of the OW-system or from the biolsy in case of phenolic waters. Firstly the variety of components in the final stream increases because waste waters from different plants are aggregated. The reduction of different kinds of components is difficult, because of different nature of components. In the final stream also the components are diluted, which also makes the reduction of components more difficult. The reduction of components can be more efficient if it is carried out at the origin of the load...|$|E

They contain eight major organic components: acrylonitrile, acrylamide, acrylic acid, acrolein, cyanopyridine, fumaronitrile, succinonitrile and maleimide. Bacteria have been isolated that grow on acylonitrile, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cyanopyridine or succinonitrile as the sources of carbon and nitrogen, or which can biotransform acrolein, fumaronitrile or maleimide. Mixed cultures of the bacteria were grown in mixed batch and continuous culture on the eight major components of the waste, and complete degradation of all the components was demonstrated (Wyatt & Knowles, Biodegradation, 6, 93 - 107, 1995). <b>Effluents</b> from <b>Stripper</b> Column Bottoms (SCB) from acrylonitrile (AN) manufacture were biodegraded by continuous mixed cultures of the bacteria, with a 75 % reduction in Chemical Oxidation Demand (COD) and over 99 % removal of detectable toxic components of the wastes. Effluents from Wastewater Column Bottoms (WWCB) from AN manufacture, which are stronger than the SCB effluents, were more resistant to biodegradation {{and had to be}} diluted 10 -fold to enable 75 % removal of COD but with a low biomass yield in the fermenter. Condensates of the WWCB and SCB were prepared by distillation to decrease the ammonia and tar content. The mixed bacterial continuous culture, as obtained in the earlier studies, was able to degrade the WWCB condensate, reducing the COD by 80 %. The SCB condensate could also be biodegraded in continuous culture, with removal of 90 % of the GOD. In both cases the microbial culture became floccular. A mixed condensate of the AN,castes was prepared by employing a recycle system on the AN manufacturing plant, to reduce the levels of ammonia rand cyanide in the effluent. A mixed bacterial continuous culture, prepared as previously, reduced the COD front 3600 to 850 - 900 ppm, and removed cyanide and all detectable toxic components of the effluent. A two-stage laboratory-scale activated sludge system, was used to degrade the mixed condensate. The process was floccular, and a biomass recycle was employed. Overall, a reduction in COD of 80 %,was obtained, but no nitrification was observed in this simple system. Gel filtration studies of the residual COD showed that it had a molecular weight of greater than 700, and was probably due to polymerization of monomeric material present in the effluents caused by their storage prior to biotreatment...|$|R
