40|$|Fluorescent silica nanoparticles, Cornell dots (C dots), were {{incorporated}} into electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) fibers. Two types of C dots were used in this study. The first type was comprised of a fluorescent dye-containing silica core surrounded by a silica shell. These nanoparticles fluoresce at 572 nm when exposed to 541 nm light. Increasing C dot loading in the spinning dope above 10 % w/w {{did not result in}} an increase in C <b>dot</b> <b>content</b> within the final fibers. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the nanoparticle incorporation had very little effect on the fiber morphology. The mechanical properties of the electrospun fabrics were not negatively affected by C dot addition, even though final loading constituted nearly one-third of the weight of the fibers. A second type of C dots, with both a fluorescent core and a pH-sensitive shell, were also incorporated in CA fibers. These C dots fluoresce at both 572 nm as described above, and at 518 nm, when exposed to 488 nm light. Fluorescence intensity at 541 nm increased with increasing pH. For both nanoparticle-incorporated fabrics, the resulting fibers are white under ambient lighting, and fluoresce at their given wavelengths of light...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this work}} was that exposure to diverse abiotic factors in two sites with different sediment and iron input (Peñón de Pesca: low impact; Island D: high impact, both areas in Potter Cove, King George Island, Antarctica) affects the physiological and oxidative profile of Gigartina skottsbergii and Himantothallus grandifolius. Daily metabolic carbon balance was significantly lower in both macroalgae from Island D compared to Peñón de Pesca. Lipid radical (LRradical <b>dot)</b> <b>content</b> was significantly higher in G. skottsbergii collected from Island D compared to Peñón de Pesca. In contrast, H. grandifolius showed significantly lower values in Island D compared to Peñón de Pesca. The β-carotene (β-C) content was significantly lower in G. skottsbergii from Island D compared to Peñón de Pesca, and the ratio LRradical dot/β-C showed a 6 -fold increase in Island D samples compared to Peñón de Pesca. On the other hand, β-C content in H. grandifolius showed {{no significant differences between}} both areas. The LRradical dot/β-C content ratio in this alga was significantly lower (26 %) in Island D as compared to Peñón de Pesca. Total iron content was significantly higher in both macroalgae from Island D compared to samples from Peñón de Pesca. Results with G. skottsbergii suggested changes in the oxidative cellular balance, probably related to the higher environmental iron in Island D as compared to Peñón de Pesca. The species H. grandifolius seems to be better adapted to the environmental conditions especially through a higher antioxidant capacity to cope with oxidative stress...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} molecular {{control of}} nanoscale composition, alloying, and morphology (aspect ratio) in CdS-CdSe nanocrystal dots and rods by modulating the chemical reactivity of phosphine-chalcogenide precursors. Specific molecular precursors studied were sulfides and selenides of triphenylphosphite (TPP), diphenylpropylphosphine (DPP), tributylphosphine (TBP), trioctylphosphine (TOP), and hexaethylphosphorustriamide (HPT). Computational (DFT), NMR (31 P and 77 Se), and high-temperature crossover studies unambiguously confirm a chemical bonding interaction between phosphorus and chalcogen atoms in all precursors. Phosphine-chalcogenide precursor reactivity {{increases in the}} order: TPPE 3 ̆c DPPE 3 ̆c TBPE 3 ̆c TOPE 1 -xSex quantum dots were synthesized via single injection of a R 3 PS-R 3 PSe mixture to cadmium oleate at 250 degree C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV/Vis and PL optical spectroscopy reveal that relative R 3 PS and R 3 PSe reactivity dictates CdS 1 -xSex <b>dot</b> chalcogen <b>content</b> {{and the extent of}} radial alloying (alloys vs core/shells). CdS, CdSe, and CdS 1 -xSex quantum rods were synthesized by injection of a single R 3 PE (E = S or Se) precursor or a R 3 PS-R 3 PSe mixture to cadmium-phosphonate at 320 or 250 degree C. XRD and TEM reveal that the length-to-diameter aspect ratio of CdS and CdSe nanorods is inversely proportional to R 3 PE precursor reactivity. Purposely matching or mismatching R 3 PS-R 3 PSe precursor reactivity leads to CdS 1 -xSe x nanorods without or with axial composition gradients, respectively.

However, present methods to measure telomere length are fraught with shortcomings that limit their use. Here, we describe a novel method to measure the relative telomere DNA <b>content</b> by <b>dot</b> blot analysis. In each <b>dot,</b> the DNA <b>content</b> is measured by a DNA stain (Dx) and the telomeric DNA content is measured with a telomeric probe (T). The T normalized for Dx (T/Dx) of each dot is a measure of telomere content. The method requires ∼ 20 [*]ng of DNA per assay. Moreover, the T/Dx data are highly correlated linearly with mean telomere lengths derived from Southern blots of the terminal restriction fragments (r[*]>[*] 0. 96, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

40|$|Thermistor {{material}} {{can be used}} to fabricate un-cooled IR detectors their ﬁgure of merit is the Temperature Coefficient of Resistance (TCR). Ge dots in Si can act as a thermistor material and they have a theoretical TCR higher than for SiGe layers but they suffer from intermixing of Si into the Ge dots. Ge dots were grown on unstrained or strained Si layers and relaxed or strained SiGe layers at temperatures of 550 and 600 °C by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD). Both single and multilayer structures where grown and characterized. To achieve a strong signal in a thermal detector a uniform shape and size distribution of the dots is desired. In this thesis work, an endeavor has been to grow uniform Ge dots with small standard deviation of their size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to characterize the size and shape distribution of Ge <b>dots.</b> Ge <b>contents</b> measured with Raman spectroscopy are higher at lower growth temperatures. Simulation of TCR for the most uniform sample grown at 600 °C give 4. 43 %/K compared to 3. 85 %/K for samples grown at 650 °C in a previous thesis work. Strained surfaces increases dot sizes and make dots align in crosshatched pattern resulting in smaller density, this effect increases with increasing strain. Strain from buried layers of Ge dots in a multilayer structure make dots align vertically. This alignment of Ge dots was very sensitive to the thickness of the Si barrier layer. The diameter of dots increase for each period in a multilayer structure. When dots are capped by a Si layer at the temperature of 600 °C intermixing of Si into the Ge dot occurs and the dot height decrease...|$|R

30|$|The {{sample is}} then excited {{with a large}} power density equal to 4, 000 W·cm− 2 in order to fill the {{low-energy}} electronic levels and allow the HE optical transition to occur. The PL dynamics at selected energies, ELE and EHE, are respectively shown on Figure 5 b,c. The time-resolved emission related to the LE transition can be fitted by the sum of a shorter exponential decay with a lifetime of 770 ps and a constant associated with the very long lifetime of the indirect transition. Many-body Auger effects leading to an enhancement of intradot carrier relaxation may lower the optical transition lifetime. The density of electron-hole pairs is indeed estimated to be high (above 10 per QD). Such effects have been observed in InAs/InP QDs[20]. For the HE transition, the emission shows a biexponential decay with short lifetimes of 340 and 1, 700 ps, respectively. Both times are consistent with a direct type-I electronic transition in QDs and a better overlap of electron and hole wave functions. The EHEELE difference is also in reasonable agreement with that of theoretical calculations.

40|$|Part of the {{challenge}} achieving maximum field density in subgrade materials is transferring the optimal compaction and moisture content data from laboratory testing to the field. This research investigated the proficiency of four different instruments at accurately predicting moisture contents of three subgrade soils (loam, silt, silty/clay) commonly used in Minnesota roadway construction projects. The four instruments were; <b>DOT</b> 600 (moisture <b>content),</b> WP 4 C dewpoint potentiometer (matric suction), the Button Heat Pulse Sensor (BHPS) (temperature rise vs. moisture content), and an exudation pressure test device. The DOT 600 showed {{a strong correlation between}} the output period (measured in micro-seconds) and volumetric water content. The WP 4 C did not accurately measure matric suction for any of the loam, silt or silt/clay soils at suctions below 250 kPa. Published data shows that the matric suction of soils compacted at optimum moisture content is usually in the range of 200 – 300 kPa. The BHPS showed a strong correlation between measured temperature rise and water content but in its current configuration is not rigorous enough to withstand field conditions. The exudation pressure device was applied to soils compacted in a AASHTO T 99 mold at various moisture contents. Water was exuded from the packed samples at pressures between 100 and 500 psi corresponding to AASHTO-T 99 moisture contents of 10 to 25 %. Accurate moisture content readings from any of these instruments may not be as important as a more precise and simple calibration between the measurement units of the instrument and the optimum moisture content determined from the AASHTO T 99 test.
