25|$|Considering that a {{standard}} television receiver screen, an LCD panel today in 2017, has over six million pixels, {{it may appear}} as somewhat of a mystery {{as to how they}} can all be powered. Luckily you don’t need twelve million wires to that panel but still 3 x 1920 + 1080 = 6840 wires. That’s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires on the horizontal edge of the panel and 1080 rows of pixels on the vertical edge. For a panel that’s 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that’s 200 wires per inch on the horizontal edge. The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. These same principles apply also for smart phone screens that are so much smaller than TV screens.LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using either adhesive plastic ribbon with conductive traces glued to the edges of the LCD panel, or with an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>connector,</b> which is a strip of rubber or silicone with alternating layers of conductive and insulating pathways, pressed between contact pads on the LCD and mating contact pads on a circuit board.|$|E

50|$|<b>Elastomeric</b> <b>connectors,</b> {{also known}} by the {{registered}} trademark ZEBRA connectors, consist of alternating conductive and insulating regions in a rubber or elastomer matrix to produce overall anisotropic conductive properties. The original version consisted of alternating conductive and insulating layers of silicone rubber, cut crosswise to expose the thin layers. They provide high-density redundant electrical paths for high reliability connections. One of the first applications was connecting thin and fragile glass liquid crystal displays (LCDs) to circuit boards in electronic devices, as little current was required.|$|R

This paper will describe a totally wireless, modular, PCM telemetry system. Using stored program format control (user programmable) and implemented with low power programmable logic devices, this new system can be altered with minimal effort and cost. Functional modules can be added or changed as program requirements evolve. <b>Elastomeric</b> <b>connectors</b> are used to achieve high density, wireless, high reliability interconnection between modules.

40|$|Vertical {{integrating}} {{systems of}} high complexity with shortest {{chip to chip}} interconnects require numerous electrical feedthroughs in the MCM-substrate and vertical interconnects between mating submodules. A planar integrating hybrid technique was employed to achieve a stackable MCM-type. This chip-first concept deliveres flat planar multichip modules. Embedded components are directly interconnected by a thinfilm multilayer wiring. Polymer dielectrics and conductor layers are deposited by thinfilm processing. The separately pretested submodules with a both sided bump-array metallization are stacked to realize shortest interconnects between {{a large number of}} ICs. To accomplish repair or system changes removable <b>elastomeric</b> <b>connectors</b> are sandwiched between mating substrates and kept under moderate pressure. Compared to common 2 D-integration reduced signal delay and reduced parasitc effects like resistance, capacitance, crosstalk and inductance result in better electrical properties. Small pretestable subunits with a moderate number of integrated components and their easy exchange in the stack should lead to a high system yield. A test chip for the measurement of package-induced stress had to be developed. Design concepts have been evaluated and teststructures were simulated. The characteristic of the teststructures on the fabricated wafers were measured and the calibration was done. The thermally-induced mechanical stress was determined in static and transient simulations that were confirmed in the measurements. In order to test the system in a more realistic application, chips were then assembled onto various substrates by both adhesive and flip-chip bonding with underfiller. The set up was able to detect the residual stresses in these configurations. (orig.)

40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged <b>connector</b> <b>elastomeric</b> seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
