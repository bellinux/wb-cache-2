50|$|<b>Fasciation</b> can {{be caused}} by {{hormonal}} imbalances in the meristematic cells of plants, which are cells where growth can occur. <b>Fasciation</b> can also be caused by random genetic mutation. Bacterial and viral infections can also cause <b>fasciation.</b> The bacterial phytopathogen Rhodococcus fascians has been demonstrated as one cause of <b>fasciation,</b> such as in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) plants, but many fasciated plants have tested negative for the bacteria in studies, hence bacterial infection is not an exclusive causation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fasciation</b> is not contagious, but {{bacteria}} that cause <b>fasciation</b> can be spread from infected plants to others from contact with wounds on infected plants and from water {{that carries the}} bacteria to other plants.|$|E

This led to oxidative damage in proliferating cells, manifested by severe necrosis in rolled-leaf and fasciated stems. Results indicated vital role of glutathione in maintaining abnormal proliferations in plant organs, and its deficiency triggered phenotypic reversal through metabolic diversions of cysteine and concomitant cellular and metabolic modulations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fasciation</b> (pronounced , {{from the}} Latin root meaning [...] "band" [...] or [...] "stripe"), {{also known as}} cresting, is a {{relatively}} rare condition of abnormal growth in vascular plants in which the apical meristem (growing tip), which normally is concentrated around a single point and produces approximately cylindrical tissue, instead becomes elongated perpendicularly to the direction of growth, thus, producing flattened, ribbon-like, crested (or [...] "cristate"), or elaborately contorted tissue. <b>Fasciation</b> may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and volume in some instances. The phenomenon may occur in the stem, root, fruit, or flower head. Some plants are grown and prized aesthetically for their development of <b>fasciation.</b> [...] Any occurrence of <b>fasciation</b> has several possible causes, including hormonal, genetic, bacterial, fungal, viral and environmental causes.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{environmental}} {{factors that can}} cause <b>fasciation</b> include fungi, mite or insect attack and exposure to chemicals. General damage to a plant's growing tip and exposure to cold and frost can also cause <b>fasciation.</b> Some plants, such as peas and cockscomb Celosia, may inherit the trait.|$|E

40|$|Rhodococcus fascians can {{interact}} with many plant species and induce {{the formation of}} either leafy galls or <b>fasciations.</b> To provoke symptoms, R. fascians strain D 188 requires pathogenicity genes that are located on a linear plasmid, pFiD 188. The fas genes are essential for virulence and constitute an operon that encodes, among other functions, a cytokinin synthase gene, Expression of the fas genes is induced by extracts of infected plant tissue only. We have isolated an AraC-type regulatory gene,fasR, located on pFiD 188, which is indispensable for pathogenesis and for fas gene expression The combined results of our experiments show that in vitro expression of the fas genes in a defined medium is strictly regulated and that several environmental factors (PH, carbon and nitrogen sources, phosphate and oxygen content, and cell density) and regulatory proteins are involved, We further show that expression of the fas genes is controlled at both the transcriptional and the translational levers. The complex expression pattern probably reflects the necessity of integrating a multitude of signals and underlines {{the importance of the}} fas operon in the pathogenicity of R. fascians. status: publishe...|$|R
