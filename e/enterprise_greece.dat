40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the concept of {{participatory}} governance through membership {{in the context of}} the tailor-made legal form for social <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece,</b> i. e. the social cooperative enterprise (Koinsep). As such, the paper aims to contribute to the theoretical discussion regarding the participation of stakeholders in the governance of social enterprises not only as a theoretical construct prescribed by law but also by examining its implementation in practice. Design/methodology/approach – The development of two in-depth case studies demonstrate whether and how the application and implementation of legal requirements regarding governance and membership permit and encourage stakeholders to participate in the decision-making processes of social enterprises. The study accordingly showcases the influence exerted by the legal regime over the social enterprise. Findings – The case studies demonstrate how participatory governance is not realised in a formal manner in the organisational set-up of two social enterprises. It thereby shows how stakeholders and employees participate informally in the decision-making processes of Greek social enterprises, although legislation is conducive to formal means of participation. Research limitations/implications – This study is part of a larger project involving a comparative research of tailor-made legal forms of social enterprises and corresponding organisations in three jurisdictions, i. e. Greece, Belgium, and the UK. In this study, the research was limited to the legal form of Koinsep. Practical implications – This paper also contributes to the development of a better understanding of the Koinsep as a new tailor-made legal form for social <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece.</b> It therefore, sheds light in its function and its participatory governance structure. Originality/value – The study is an original attempt to theoretically and practically examine the subject of participatory governance in the Greek social enterprises context...|$|R

The study draws on qualitative data gathered from 63 interviews with employees in a total of 48 small <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece</b> in two periods of time (2009 and 2015).

30|$|The results {{regarding}} {{the impact of}} the two public policy factors indicate the crucial role in certification decisions of information provision and of the fines imposed by authorities on fruit and vegetable producers who do not meet the specific quality requirements. This, in combination with the conclusions of Kalaitzis et al. (2007) concerning the difficulties of some Mediterranean exporting firms in having access to European retailer chains that impose quality certification requirements, indicates the necessity of public policy interventions in order to promote QMS. These results could be generalised in the case of fruit and vegetable <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece,</b> but a more efficient public policy can be achieved if a more focused policy mix and implementation pathway is scheduled for different products and regions taking into account economic development, industrial structure and institutional capacity (Guo et al. 2012).|$|R

Line managers are an intriguing group to study because they act as both supervisors to their teams and as supervisees (employees) to senior managers/business owners. We draw on qualitative data gathered from line managers in 35 small non-unionized <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece</b> in two periods of time (2012 and 2014) during the economic crisis.

50|$|Eurydice, {{once again}} {{relatively}} powerless, accompanied {{her husband and}} Antipater to Macedonia. But the death of Antipater in 319 BC, the more feeble character of Polyperchon, who succeeded him as regent, {{and the failure of}} his <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece,</b> and above all, the favourable disposition he evinced towards Olympias, determined her again to take an active part: she concluded an alliance with Cassander, and, as he was wholly occupied with the affairs of Greece, she herself assembled an army and took the field in person. Polyperchon advanced against her from Epirus, accompanied by Aeacides, the king of that country, and Olympias, as well as by Roxana and her infant son. But the presence of Olympias was alone sufficient to decide the contest: the Macedonian troops refused to fight against the mother of Alexander the Great, and went over to her side.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of both CEO and top management team (TMT) characteristics {{on the process of}} making strategic decisions (SDs). Empirical testing is based on a sample of 70 SDs in industrial <b>enterprises</b> operating in <b>Greece,</b> using a combination of interviews, questionnaires and archival data. The results suggest that (a) the characteristics of both the TMT and the CEO influenced the strategic decision-making process, but the former had more influence, (b) the TMT and CEO influenced different dimensions of the process, and (c) the broader context of SDs is more influential than either the CEO or the TMT. Among the most important factors was the TMT’s “aggressiveness ” (commitment to beating the competition, attitude to innovation, willingness to take risks). The results lend support to the “upper echelons ” perspective, but suggest that in studying strategic decision-making processes both CEO and TMT characteristics should be considered, in conjunction with the broader context.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the strategy formulation {{of small and}} medium <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece</b> by measuring the two principal dimensions of the strategy formulation process, the normative/descriptive dimension and the individual/collective dimension. For {{the purposes of the}} thesis a theoretical model of strategy formulation is proposed and evaluated, drawing upon the principles of contingency theory which presumes that there is no exclusive approach to strategy formulation which applies likewise to all firms in all circumstances. According to contingency theory there are many variables or factors which predict and influence the decision of formulating a strategy. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the role of accounting information on the process of strategy formulation by examining the relationship between the adoption of a specific strategy formulation approach and the information sources that SMEs use, the extensiveness of accounting information usage and the perceived usefulness of accounting information to SME managers. Using a data-triangulation (semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire), the findings of the study show the following: First, organizational size, perceived environmental volatility, the level of technology and specific owner manager characteristics (experience and education) are all significant predictors of SMEs adoption of a specific strategy formulation approach. Second, accounting information usage is positively associated with the normative and collective strategy formulation approaches. More specific, SMEs which utilize a broad range of information sources, which engage in extensive accounting information utilization and which perceive accounting information as very useful are positively correlated with the normative and collective approaches of strategy formulation. Third, financial performance was found to have a positive relationship with the descriptive and individualistic approach to strategy, meaning that SME owner managers who employ emergent strategies without the collaboration and participation of others in the process tend to achieve higher levels of profitability. Fourth, {{significant differences were found between}} SMEs having a different ownership status (family and non-family SMEs) and belonging to different business sectors (retail, construction and service providing firms) in relation to strategy formulation approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{ownership}} advantages of multinational enterprises' (MNEs) subsidiaries and domestic <b>enterprises</b> (DMEs) in <b>Greece.</b> Previous studies have tested {{the hypothesis that}} ownership-specific advantages (Oa) are {{a major source of}} firm differences. This study analyses the processed food sector (SIC= 20) - the leading industrial sector in Greece with the highest inward and outward internationalization degree - using a panel data set of 75 firms and 5 years. The findings of a probabilistic regression analysis indicate that there are {{significant differences between the two}} groups of firms in the degree of possession of observed ownership advantages. MNE subsidiaries have higher market shares, use multiplant operations and have higher advertising and R&D to sales ratios compared to DMEs. DMEs use their well-established position (knowledge of domestic and regional market conditions, and size economies) in order to compete effectively with MNE subsidiaries. It is inferred that pursuit of domestic market development is an important motivation in such subsidiaries, in an attempt to build on (rather than substitute for) the strong and distinctive established product base of Greek food industry companies. By assimilating Greek food knowledge alongside their own the MNEs developed export-orientation into their subsidiaries in Greece, which eventually have played a notable role in the regional market (Balkans). ...|$|R

For the most countries, the mainstream of business owners are male, while in Greece, the percentage of women entrepreneurs is only 15 %, and in the rural area, even smaller. Government poli-cies and the European Union is supporting women entrepreneurship, since women in the labor sector are important factors of development and society’s progress. This paper presents the findings of a research regarding women’s’ firms functioning in the agrotourism sector.

40|$|Purpose: The {{strategic}} importance of sourcing {{is inherent in}} the positioning of the purchasing operation in a supply chain and supplier evaluation - a crucial step in sourcing - is a complex multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a meta-model for supplier evaluation and order quantity allocation, based on a MCDM method, namely the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and a multiobjective mathematical programming method (MOMP), the AUGMECON. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed approach consists of two parts. The former develops and applies the ANP method in order to evaluate the suppliers in qualitative terms. The latter implements the AUGMECON method in order to find the Pareto optimal solutions for the allocation of order quantities in a multiple sourcing environment. The integrated meta-model is exposed through an illustrative case concerning the parapharmaceutical <b>enterprise</b> cluster in <b>Greece.</b> Findings: The proposed meta-model constitutes an efficient method that enables managers to actively participate in the decision making process and exploit the ""qualitative value"" of their suppliers, while minimizing the costs and the mean delivery times. In addition, it is proved to be suitable for the enterprise clusters, as it adapts a multiple sourcing strategy and enhances the partnership among the members. Research limitations/implications: The outcome of the model is highly dependent on the inputs provided by the decision maker. Moreover, the ANP method is computational intensive, but this limitation can be alleviated by appropriate software tools. Originality/value: The proposed meta-model is an innovative approach for decision making in the area of multiple sourcing and order allocation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|Palatial {{involvement}} in the Mycenaean economy {{has long been a}} subject of debate in Mediterranean archaeology and many studies have been made of workshops belonging to Mycenaean palatial complexes. This thesis seeks to determine the role, if any, of possible domestic production in Mycenaean Greece based on published reports of excavated material. First, an outline of already existing research is given in the introduction and the research period and area of this thesis are defined. Questions that are central to this thesis are presented and the sources and methods used to answer these questions are given. A brief outline {{of the structure of the}} thesis is also given in this section. Next follows a description of the geographical setting of the research area and the social organisation of Mycenaean states and the place household production could hold in this context. Also included in this chapter is a summary of the different economical models used to interpret the Mycenaean economy and the criteria for identifying a Mycenaean workshop is outlined. Thirdly, sites selected using the criteria discussed in the previous section are examined for signs of industrial activity on a large scale. These sites are then compared to each other on an inter-regional as well as an intra-regional level and the possibility and role of private <b>enterprise</b> in Mycenaean <b>Greece</b> is subsequently discussed based on the evidence presented in this thesis. In the conclusion it is seen that it is difficult to identify workshops of the Mycenaean period as it is difficult to differentiate between dependent and independent craftsmen, though the existence of local, decentralised, manufacturing activity can be demonstrated at certain sites. Finally, the need for more information by making already existing information readily accessible and conducting more research is addressed. ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} field of Human Resource Management (HRM) in Greece. Greece suffers from high {{unemployment}} rates, low demand for labour, and by a severe problem in creating high-skill and new technologically-oriented jobs (Karasiotou 2004; Staikouras 2004; National Statistical Service of Greece 2005). These factors precondition the Greek market in being one of limited investment and expansion opportunities (Eurostat 2008), while businesses are characterised by their small size (micro enterprises) : 54. 6 per cent of all registered businesses are owner only and 43. 7 per cent employ from 1 - 10 employees, while large organisations (250 + employees) only account for a meagre 0. 05 per cent of all registered businesses in the Greek market (National Statistical Service of Greece 2002). With an average organisational size of two employees per company, businesses in Greece can be characterised as very small {{in comparison to the}} EU average (Galanaki and Papalexandris 2007). However, the Greek economy significantly depends on the operation of micro enterprises. The share in total employment of micro <b>enterprises</b> in <b>Greece</b> accounts for 59. 6 per cent, in comparison to an EU- 27 average of 29. 5 per cent, while the share in total value added in the economy by micro enterprises accounts for 38. 6 per cent, in comparison to an EU- 27 average of 20. 2 per cent (Eurostat 2008). In addition, since the Greek economic environment is characterised by low government and business efficiency, low competitiveness, and low attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI), this leads to lower levels of investment and presence of MNCs in the market (for example, Haritakis and Pitelis 1998; Joumard and Mylonas 1999; Staikouras 2004). At several points throughout this chapter, a discussion on the differences in HRM practices between small-medium-large Greek firms and MNCs will take place. This discussion is essential in order to illustrate the differences in HRM practices in MNCs, large Greek organisations, and small/medium-sized Greek firms, since it is micro enterprises (up to 10 employees) that constitute the majority of enterprises in the country, while large Greek firms and MNCs only constitute a meagre minority. The chapter explores HRM practices in Greece by, firstly, providing a brief historical overview of the HR function in order to provide the necessary background to the reader to understand the current state of HRM in Greece. Secondly, it highlights issues relating the supply and demand for labour in the Greek labour market in order to illustrate organisational HR structures. Thirdly, it explores the Greek HR department and HR managers so that the particularities affecting the size and role of the department, as well as the level of professionalism of managers are understood. Fourthly, it provides an overview of the core HR activities (recruitment and selection, performance management and appraisals, training and development, employee rewards, and employee relations). Fifthly, the practice of outsourcing HR activities to external providers is discussed, as this is common practice for many Greek organisations. Sixthly, an overview of the use of e-HR is provided, as {{this is one of the}} latest developments in the field. Finally, two critical issues in HRM are explored; the ageing workforce and gender equality in the Greek workplace. [Author's description...|$|R
