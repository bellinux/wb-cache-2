5|$|Modi {{spent the}} ensuing two years {{travelling}} across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details {{of where he}} went <b>have</b> <b>emerged.</b> <b>In</b> interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained {{only a short time}} at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda {{has been described as a}} large influence in Modi's life.|$|E
5|$|Some {{preservation}} successes <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Two {{proposals to}} open a casino at Gettysburg were defeated in 2006 and most recently in 2011, when public pressure forced the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to reject the proposed gambling hub {{at the intersection of}} Routes 15 and 30, near East Cavalry Field. The Civil War Trust also successfully purchased and transferred 95 acres at the former site of the Gettysburg Country Club to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his {{relation}} to King Eric seem to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> {{the historical record}} {{at the same time}} in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its patronus, that is first mentioned only in 1452. Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style is said to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> Madagascar. Moraingy, {{a type of}} hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|Mantou kiln: The mantou kiln was {{the most}} common type of pottery kiln in north China, in {{historical}} periods when the dragon kiln dominated south China; both seem to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the Warring States period of approximately 475 to 221 BC. It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt}} to standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, {{the leader of the}} Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The {{single largest}} group of English castles are now those owned by English Heritage, created out of the former Ministry of Works in 1983. The National Trust {{increasingly}} acquired castle properties in England in the 1950s, and is the second largest single owner, followed by the various English local authorities and finally {{a small number of}} private owners. Royal castles such as the Tower of London and Windsor are owned by the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate on behalf of the nation. Similar organisations exist in Scotland, where the National Trust for Scotland was established 1931, and in Ireland, where An Taisce was created in 1948 to working alongside the Irish Ministry of Works to maintain castles and other sites. Some new organisations <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> recent years to manage castles, such as the Landmark Trust and the Irish Landmark Trust, which have restored a number of castles in Britain and Ireland over the last few decades.|$|E

25|$|More recently, however, {{examples}} of conspicuous consumer control of entire ecosystems <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> {{a variety of}} habitats including lakes (Carpenter et al. 1985), rivers (Power 1992), and marine (Estes and Duggins 1995) habitats.

25|$|A large {{satellite}} {{also increases}} the likelihood of plate tectonics through the effect of tidal forces on the planet's crust.

25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large, {{strongly}} built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat.
