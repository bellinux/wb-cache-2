25|$|During the Meiji {{restoration}} the Nihonjinron philosophy took prevalence. It {{emphasizes the}} uniqueness of the Japanese. This uniqueness has been attributed to many different factors. Suzuki attributed it to Zen. In his view, Zen embodies the ultimate essence of all philosophy and religion. <b>He</b> <b>pictured</b> Zen as a unique expression of Asian spirituality, which was considered to be superior to the western ways of thinking.|$|E
25|$|From August 4 through August 12, 1498, he {{explored}} the Gulf of Paria which separates Trinidad from mainland Venezuela. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the Orinoco River. He also sailed {{to the islands}} of Chacachacare and Margarita Island and sighted and named islands Bella Forma (Tobago) and Concepcion (Grenada). He described the new lands as belonging to a previously unknown new continent, but <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> it hanging from China, bulging out to make the earth pear-shaped.|$|E
25|$|This metric is {{critical}} for understanding the time durations that are unavoidable while transitioning from the second stage to the third stage of Bhabha’s plan, because building up a sufficiently large fissile stock {{is essential to the}} large deployment of the third stage. In Bhabha's 1958 papers on role of thorium, <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> a doubling time of 5–6 years for breeding U-233 in the Th–U233 cycle. This estimate has now been revised to 70 years due to technical difficulties that were unforeseen at the time. Despite such setbacks, according to publications done by DAE scientists, the doubling time of fissile material in the fast breeder reactors can be brought down to about 10 years by choosing appropriate technologies with short doubling time.|$|E

500|$|Brown had {{run into}} {{problems}} doing autobiographical stories of his contemporary life, as his story interconnected with the stories of those around him—the friends he portrayed did not always agree with the way <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> them. [...] He portrays his friend Kris's negative reaction in [...] "Showing Helder" [...] to his depiction of her in [...] "Helder". [...] Brown turned to tales of his teenage years, as he had lost contact with most of those he knew from that time. [...] Brown stated that he intended a longer story encompassing what ended up in The Playboy and the following graphic novel, I Never Liked You (1994), but when planning it he found it was too complex. [...] He {{said he had a}} clear idea of the stories from his life that he would use, and the general shape of the narrative, but he had a [...] "sense of improvising" [...] as he did not script it out beforehand.|$|E
500|$|Having {{admired her}} {{performance}} in Hard Candy, Reitman cast Ellen Page {{in the lead}} role, saying that when he read the screenplay {{for the first time}} <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> her as Juno. He visited her on the set of a film on which she was working to offer her the role. He also handed the script to J.K. Simmons, who had featured in his previous film, Thank You for Smoking, not telling him that he intended Simmons to play Mac. Simmons says that, after reading the script, he would have been happy to play even the high school teacher who has no speaking lines. Other cast members Reitman had [...] "in mind right from the start" [...] were Olivia Thirlbywho had originally unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Junoand Michael Cera. He took them with Page and Simmons to a Panavision stage in California and shot 45 pages of the script on 35 mm film against a black backdrop. He presented this footage to Fox Searchlight as the initial cast. Reitman highlighted the importance of doing a screen test instead of individual auditions, saying: [...] "This is a movie that’s all about relationships and the idea of auditioning people outside of each other, one-on-one with the casting director, didn’t make sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Trumbull and Dykstra {{found the}} Magicam models problematic. The Klingon cruiser's {{lighting}} was so dim {{that there was}} no way to make them bright enough on film. As Trumbull also felt the Enterprises lights were ill-suited for his needs, he rewired both models. He questioned that the Enterprise could be traveling years from any source of light and yet still be fully illuminated. Instead of having the ship completely dark save for viewports, Trumbull came up with a system of self-illumination; <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> the ship as something like an oceanliner, [...] "a grand lady of the seas at night". A similar method was used on the Klingon cruiser model, but he made it less well-lit to convey a different look than the clean visuals of the Federation—the cruiser was meant to evoke [...] "an enemy submarine in World War II that's been out at sea for too long". The models were filmed in multiple passes and composited together in post-production; multiple passes with only the model's lighting running were added to the original pass for the final look. The Klingon cruiser sequence was developed to avoid an opening similar to Star Wars, with one model used for all three seen in the film.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Ignatius Donnelly's enormously popular Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882), a number of novelists chose Atlantis as the setting for their fictions. Parry's book shows the influence of Donnelly: <b>he</b> <b>pictures</b> the ancient Phoenicians, the Aztecs, and the Incas as offshoots of Atlantean civilization.|$|R

2500|$|When Lloyd Webber saw {{the film}} in the early 1970s, he was {{inspired}} to write what <b>he</b> <b>pictured</b> as the title song for a theatrical adaptation, fragments of which he instead incorporated into Gumshoe. [...] In 1976, after a conversation with Hal Prince, who had the theatrical rights to Sunset, Lloyd Webber wrote [...] "an idea for the moment when Norma Desmond returns to Paramount Studios"; Lloyd Webber did no further work on the play until after 1989's Aspects of Love.|$|E

60|$|The {{other was}} from Edward Springrove. He {{told her that}} she was the bright spot of his life: that her {{existence}} was far dearer to him than his own: that he had never known what it was to love till he had met her. True, he had felt passing attachments to other faces from time to time; but they all had been weak inclinations towards those faces as they then appeared. He loved her past and future, as well as her present. <b>He</b> <b>pictured</b> her as a child: he loved her. <b>He</b> <b>pictured</b> her of sage years: he loved her. <b>He</b> <b>pictured</b> her in trouble; he loved her. Homely friendship entered into his love for her, without which all love was evanescent.|$|E
