It {{has long been known}} that in the human, destructive lesions of the adrenal cortex are responsible for the fatal disease described by Addison in 1855 and which bears his name. In Addison's disease, the symptoms and signs are pigmentation of skin and mucous membrane, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances,</b> asthenia, low blood pressure, dehydration and hamoconcentration (increased sodium excretion, low blood sodium), high blood potassium and hypoglycemia in the terminal stages.

Sixty patients were recruited and treated at No's 1 and 2 Military Hospitals in Voortrekkerhoogte and Wynberg, Cape Town, respectively. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: meclofenamate, diclofenac and placebo. Patient assessments were performed on days 1, 3 and 7 of the 7 -day study period. These assessments included pain assessment (visual analogue scale), swelling measurement (thigh circumference measurement at the site of the muscle tear) and muscle performance test (Cybex isokinetic dynamometer and data reduction computer). All patients received physiotherapy treatment on all 7 days of the study. This comprised early rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE), and later, ultrasound and deep transverse friction massage. An intensive regime of strengthening and stretching exercises was used throughout the study, beginning with stretching and isometric exercises gradually moving onto isotonic exercises and aerobic exercise including swimming, running and cycling. No competitive sport was allowed during the study period. Statistical significance was determined using the analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) test with an acceptance level of p< 0. 05. No differences in pain, swelling or muscle performance were demonstrated between the three treatment groups. In terms of the pain and swelling assessments, the injuries did not appear to be very severe. Accordingly, the groups were divided into severe and non-severe sub-groups and statistical significance was determined using the ANOVA test with an acceptance level of p< 0. 05. A significant difference was found in the severe hamstring injury sub-group. In this group, pain reduction was greater in the placebo group than in the meclofenamate group on day 7. There were no other significant differences found in this sub-group analysis. Relatively few side effects were encountered, and those encountered were mild. No patients were withdrawn from the study as a result of these adverse events. Drowsiness and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbance</b> were the most common side effects reported. In conclusion, the study found that no benefit was gained from the use of meclofenamate or diclofenac in combination with physiotherapeutic modalities as compared to the use of physiotherapeutic modalities on their own. Thus, the widespread use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute muscle injuries may not be justified...|$|R

40|$|Aim: We {{investigated}} if Geophagia {{is restricted}} to only pregnant and lactating women in Ghana. We also investigated if the key driver of Geophagia is poverty and other socio-cultural factors. Methods: This analysis {{was part of a}} broader national study of resilience among the population of Ghana (N= 2, 000). Regional comparisons were made possible due to the stratified and random selection of representations that were similar in characteristics such as being urban or rural, ethnicity, religion and gender. Results: It was found that Geophagia was present among both females and males and was not restricted to pregnant and lactating women. Geophagia was not driven by poverty or the lack of formal education or the presence of gainful employment. Geophagia was practiced by both urban and rural residents irrespective of religious proclivities and devotion. The assertion that Geophagia was an instinctive primordial response to <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> was not sustained by the data in this study, although the literature review suggested such in calves and lambs. Conclusion: In order to address the potential health threats posed by Geophagia, the key cultural drivers need to be studied and understood. We also need to appreciate the shocks and stresses that create such desires. It is not a case of mental illness and it cannot be concluded that Geophagia is driven by a psychiatric disorder.

40|$|Background: Late {{diagnosis}} of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and delayed commencement of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa {{is known to}} contribute to high morbidity and mortality. It is therefore, prudent to develop innovative approaches to ensure early HIV diagnosis because patients with low immunity will usually develop opportunistic infections and seek some remedial action. A treatment and health care seeking behavior survey {{was carried out in}} semi-urban communities in Malaba and Busia in Kenya and Uganda to evaluate the treatment and healthcare seeking behavior among patients visiting randomly selected drugstores. Methodology: Random sampling was applied and questionnaires were used to collect information from 165 interviewees who visited drugstores seeking health information, treatment and other health related services. Results: The results indicated that among this group of people, 67 % visited drugstores before any other health facility. 72. 2 % sought treatment for various illnesses and services ranging from headaches, body fever, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances,</b> family planning pills, sexually transmitted infections and chronic medications. Among the patients interviewed, {{there were a number of}} factors that affected treatment choice. These included the distance to the facility as well as the absence of a consultation fee or fee for service. Conclusion: With proper support, drugstores can play a major role in the implementation of health interventions that seek to promote early diagnosis and treatment as well as play a pivotal role in educating the population on disease prevention and management.

40|$|The acute <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> of in-fants {{have always}} been a source of anxiety to the pediatrician. Nutritional therapy has made severe demands upon his skill. The two horns of the dilemma are, first, that any kind of food by mouth may lead to {{increase}} of untoward symptoms al-ready present, i. e. diarrhea and vomiting; and second, that deprivation of food for a relatively short time may lead to collapse. The accompany-ing dehydration and acidosis are complications which often cause a fatal outcome. We have learned, {{over the course of the}} last few decades, how to replenish the interstitial fluids, to overcome the acidosis, and to provide for a substantial por-tion of the caloric requirement by parenteral therapy. This, coupled with the use of sulfon-amides when indicated, constitutes such great improvement in therapy that modern clinicians with good hospital facilities no longer have the same dread of these diseases as those of a gen-eration ago. But these procedures still do not provide nitro-gen, which is essential for normal nutrition. Pro-tein or its equivalent could, until fairly recently, be supplied only by intravenous plasma infusions. Another source of nitrogen is now available for intravenous use,-protein hydrolysate. Such a preparation has already been shown to be an adequate source of nitrogen for the nutrition of infants who are not ill, whether given orally or intravenously (1).

SETTING [...] A representative panel of Dutch community pharmacies serving approximately 425, 000 people was used. MAIN RESULTS [...] Oscorel was launched in January 1989. Data on prescriptions dispensed in 1987 - 1988 to a total of 837 first users of Oscorel were analysed and compared with the dispensing history of a reference population including 30, 787 patients who did not receive a prescription for Oscorel during 1989. Compared to the reference population, first users of Oscorel included a greater proportion of females, of patients 75 years and older, of heavy users of NSAIDs, and of patients switching among different NSAIDs. A total of 24. 1 % of first users of Oscorel had received peptic ulcer therapy in 1987 - 1988, versus 15. 7 % of the reference population. The rate ratio was 1. 54, with 95 % confidence interval of 1. 36 - 1. 74. Adjustment for stratifying variables caused only minor changes in the rate ratio, which remained stable on 1. 5. CONCLUSIONS [...] Oscorel appears to have been channelled into use in patients with recognised risk factors for gastrointestinal toxicity.

They were examined within 48 hours of surgery. In addition, ten examinations were described as isolated cases. They were: a follow-up examination of one horse three weeks after the baseline examination; the examination of two horses while they were receiving an infusion; and the examination of seven horses with clear-cut symptoms (acute post-infection kidney failure, chronic kidney failure, primary polydipsia, renal tubular acidosis, multiple lymphosarcoma). All horses underwent clinical and diagnostic lab tests (urea and creatinin concentrations in the blood, urea concentrations in the urine, fractional sodium excretion, gamma-glutamyl transferase activity in the urine), followed by a conventional B-mode sonography and a Duplex-Doppler sonography performed with a System FiVe apparatus from GE Healthcare and a 2. 5 MHz sector probe. The Duplex-Doppler sonography was performed on defined measuring points in the second-order renal artery. Two sonographic recordings of three cardiac cycles each were made separately from one another, and the following flow velocities were then measured offline: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMAX). The results were used to calculate the following resistance indices: resistive index (RI), pulsatility index (PI) and A/B ratio. The obtained values provide a measure for vascular resistance in the sonographically examined area. Doppler-sonographic imaging and analysis of the equine renal blood flow proved possible. As in human medicine, however, obesity caused some restrictions. In addition, body and breathing movements of the horses could not be prevented. As expected, all blood flow parameters examined in the subjects showed a broad fluctuation range {{as a consequence of the}} different diseases and their outcomes. Compared to Group 1 (n= 9) the flow velocities in Group 2 (n= 9) were significantly reduced (p&# 8804; 0. 05). On average, the horses of Group 3 showed lower flow velocities compared to the horses in the control group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). None of the patients showed increased resistance indices. This suggests that the reasons for the obtained results lie in the selection of patients, because their renal function impairment was almost exclusively of a primarily pre-renal nature, and it demonstrates that haemodynamic changes as a cause of renal blood flow modifications can be visualised regardless of damage to the renal parenchyma. No correlations between the data obtained in Doppler sonography and diagnostic lab parameters were found. The visualisation of the renal blood flow velocity profile is a sensitive examination method that can be used to diagnose impaired renal function even before lab parameter changes occur, because it offers additional diagnostic information. Further, it helps to monitor the course of the disease, including the identification of potential renal complications, until kidney function is restored. In light of the results from this study Doppler-sonographic imaging and analysis of renal blood flow rates in horses can be recommended as a valuable, non-invasive diagnostic procedure. Reduced flow velocities point to existing renal impairment. Using this diagnostic procedure the course of the disease and therapeutic success can be documented...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. - For {{the last}} six years the {{consumption}} of exogenous creatine monohydrate has been extended more and more. Despite numerous publications on the ergogenic effects of this naturally occurring substance, there is almost no information on the deleterious effects of this supplement. The objectives of this review are to point out facts which are often in contradiction with allegations introduced by the media. Topics. - In athletes, exogenous creatine supplements amount to 20 g per day during five days followed by 1 to 10 g per day, every day, for weeks, months; and even years. Usually consumers do not report side-effects, with the exception of body weight increase. However, <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> and muscle cramps have been reported occasionally. Liver and kidney dysfunction have also been hypothesized but real facts are missing for this. From a theoretical point of view, exogenous creatine supplementation suppresses its hepatic synthesis (maximum 2 g per day for vegetarians). Its destination is mainly (95 - 98 %) skeletal muscle and all excess is excreted in urine (on average 60 % of the supplement). Scientific publications on the undesirable effects of exogenous creatine are almost non-existent, but newspapers and the media do not hesitate to publish false information or wrong interpretations based on one individual case of an individual with nephropathy who, later on, consumed creatine monohydrate. In addition, we did not find any sideeffects on renal function after short-term (five days), medium-term (nine weeks) or long-term (up to five years) creatine supplementation in small cohorts of athletes. Future prospects. - We have no intention to validate or not the supplementation of exogenous creatine by athletes, but apparently there are no real deleterious effects on the body of healthy consumers. Nevertheless, one has to be careful about individual reactions when excess food are taken up. We are convinced that regular biological check-ups are needed to avoid any abnormal reaction under creatine supplementation. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|On the 36 {{cases with}} trichomonas {{vaginitis}} treated at our hospital (Okayama Saiseikai Hospital) by administering trichothamin (2 -Acetylamino- 5 -nitrothiazoel) in a daily dosage of 300 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg, the authors followed up {{the results of}} the treatment by the droplet method and Papanicolaou's smears, and obtained the following results: Those temporarily cured only on the oral administration of trichothamin amounted to 84. 2 per cent; those treated mainly with oral administration but combined it with suppository the cure rate was 88. 8 per cent; and the rate of recurrent cases of those who had been followed up more than three weeks after the cessation of treatment was 50 per cent, namely, 9 cases out of 18 that had been followed up. The average total doses used was 7155 mg in the cases cured, and 423 mg in the cases who had recurrence. As for the side effect 30. 5 per cent showed the side effects mainly consisting of the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> However, the side effect was most noticeable in those given a daily dosage of 6 CCmg, but those given the daily dosage of 300 mg or 400 mg showed only a slight side effect, and those receiving the drug in tablet form showed no side effect at all. Those treated continuously for a quite length of time hardly revealed any ill effect either. As for the treatment of the vaginitis by combination of oral and suppository administration, one tablet containing 50 mg of trichothothiazole inserted into the vagina at the first call to the hospital has much more germicidal effect than the oral adminstration alone, and in addition, there is no side effect in evidence. In comparing the cured cases and recurrent cases and studying the amount and the method of administration of the drug in the treatment of recurrent cases, we consider that the daily dosage of 300 mg or 400 mg given continuously until the total amount reaches about 7, 000 mg will yield the result and that the spouse should also be treated concurrently in order to obtain a better result...|$|E
40|$|By {{combining}} {{physiological and}} anatomical methods {{in the study}} of experimental nephritis it is possible to distinguish types of nephritis in which either tubular or vascular changes predominate, and are essentially characteristic of the lesion produced, but {{it is not possible to}} say that a given poison produces exclusively tubular or exclusively vascular lesions. The so-called epithelial poisons (potassium chromate, uranium nitrate and corrosive sublimate) present anatomical evidence of extensive tubular injury, and in the early stages show, on physiological study, no evidence of vascular injury other than exaggerated contraction and dilatation of the vessels and increased diuresis. On the other hand, the vascular poisons, arsenic and cantharidin, which produce but little injury to the tubules, tend to cause anuria and are characterized by minimal contraction and dilatation of the vessels and little or no flow of urine. From the physiological point of view these two types may be, for practical purposes, considered as examples of tubular and vascular nephritis. They are not, however, pure types; for the increased diuresis of the early tubular type is in itself evidence of vessel irritability and similar to the increased irritability caused by small doses of vascular poisons, and on the other hand, this essentially vascular lesion is accompanied by slight morphological changes in the tubular epithelium. Furthermore, the tubular lesions of chromium and uranium and corrosive sublimate pass into a stage closely resembling the vascular type, if not identical with it. Two forms of late tubular nephritis may be recognized. One of these, the anuric form, is accompanied by severe gastro-intestinal disturbance and evidence of approaching anuria; physiological tests show diminished power of dilatation of the vessels and corresponding inhibition of diuresis. The second form, the polyuric, is characterized by a condition of polyuria up to the moment of anesthesia; physiological tests show that the power of dilatation is retained, but little or no diuresis occurs. Whether the vascular incompetency of the anuric form of late tubular lesions is a natural consequence of the vessel irritability seen in the early stages or is the result of the elimination of secondary poisons through the glomeruli cannot be absolutely determined. The peculiar impermeability of the glomerulus following anesthetization in the polyuric form, which is essentially a stage of recovery, we hope to explain by investigations now in progress. Studies of the elimination of nitrogen show that in tubular nephritis, as represented by uranium nephritis, the output of nitrogen is considerably diminished. This apparently occurs also in chromate nephritis but is not clearly demonstrated. In both forms the onset of <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances</b> appears to bear a definite relation to the retention of nitrogen. On the other hand, as the nitrogen of the feces is not appreciably altered, these disturbances cannot be explained by the elimination through the intestine of toxic bodies of nitrogenous nature. The nitrogen elimination in the urine in vascular nephritis as represented by arsenic nephritis is not only not diminished but is greatly increased as the result of the increased metabolism caused by arsenic. If at the height of this increased elimination, uranium nitrate is administered, the nitrogen output is markedly diminished. These observations demonstrate that not only are the tubular lesions in arsenic nephritis of little moment, but also that serious injury of the epithelium, as that due to uranium, may cause a temporary nitrogen retention. A consideration of all the facts here presented allows us to conclude that although it is not possible to demonstrate that an experimental nephritis may be purely tubular or purely vascular, which is in accord with our clinical and pathological studies of human material, it is possible, if we combine the results of anatomical, physiological and chemical study, to recognize lesions which are predominantly tubular or vascular, or which change rather sharply from one to the other type, and are, therefore, of great value {{in the study of}} the problems of nephritis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The skin is {{an amazing}} elastic and {{relatively}} impermeable barrier that provides protective, perceptive and communication functions to the body. The stratum corneum is widely accepted as the barrier of the skin - limiting the transport of molecules into and across the skin. It is evident that the transdermal permeation of drugs depend {{on a number of}} factors of which the physicochemical properties play the most prevalent role. The potential of using intact skin as the site of administration for dermatological preparations to elicit pharmacological action in the skin tissue has been well recognised. Transdermal drug delivery offers several advantages over oral and parenteral dosing. They include avoiding hepatic first pass metabolism, maintaining constant blood levels for longer periods of time, improving bioavailabiliv, decreasing the administered dose, adverse effects and gastrointestinal side effects, easy discontinuation in case of toxic effects and improved patient compliance. Optimal transport through the skin requires a drug to possess lipophilic as well as hydrophilic properties. Research has indicated that the ideal log P value for optimal transdermal permeation is between 1 and 2. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity, and as an anti-inflammatory analgesic agent it is used in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Its use is limited to the relief of pain and inflammation, as it does not halt the progression of the pathological injury caused to the tissue. Acetylsalicylic acid is also used in the treatment of fever, prevention of thromboembolic disorders, reducing the incidence of colon cancer and it delays the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The most common adverse effect of acetylsalicylic acid occurring with therapeutic doses is <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The primary aim {{of this study was to}} determine the transderrnal penetration of acetylsalicylic acid and some of its derivatives and to establish a correlation, if any, with selected physicochemical properties. The ten derivatives of acetylsalicylic acid were prepared by esterification of acetylsalicyloyl chloride with ten different alcohols. The structures of the products were confirmed by mass spectroscopy (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for methyl acetylsalicylate. Experimental aqueous solubility and partition coefficients were determined for acetylsalicylic acid and its different derivatives at a pH of 4, 5. In vitro penetration was measured through excised female human abdominal skin in diffusion cells. The prediction software Interactive Analysis (IA) was used to predict aqueous solubility, while prediction software IA, &,Win and ACD Labs were used to predict the log P values for each derivative. None of the predicted values correlated with the experimental values. The experimental aqueous solubilily, partition coefficient and transdermal flux values were determined for acetylsalicylic acid and its derivatives. The experimental aqueous solubilily of acetylsalicylic acid (6, 56 mg/ml) was higher than that of the synthesised acetylsalicylate derivatives (ranging from 1, 76 x lo 3 to 3, 32 mg/ml), and the partition coefficient of acetylsalicylic acid (- 0, 85) was lower than that of its derivatives (ranging from - 0, 25 to 1, 954. There was thus a direct correlation between the aqueous solubility data and the partition coefficients. The experimental transdermal flux of acetylsalicylic acid (4733 pg/cm 2 /h) was much higher than that of its derivatives (ranging from 0, 03 to 28, 32 pg/cm 2 /h). With the ethyl derivative (28, 32 pg/cm 2 /h) and the methyl derivative (10, 06 pg/cm 2 /h) being the only derivatives with appreciable flux. Pentyl acetylsalicylate (0, 03 pg/cm 2 /h) had the lowest flux. The higher flux values of acetylsalicylic acid and its methyl and ethyl derivatives might be due to the fact that it is more hydrophilic and had better aqueous solubilily, thus permeating through the proteins of the skin. Pentyl acetylsalicylate had a log P value of 1, 95, but had the lowest flux (0, 03 pg/cm 2 /h), just proving once again that to cross the stratum corneum a drug should posses both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties. Tert-butyl acetylsalicylate had a flux (7, 30 &cm 2 /h) lower than that of methyl and ethyl acetylsalicylate, but a higher flux than the other synthesised derivatives which could be due to its log P value being slightly greater than 1 and having an average aqueous solubility. The low transdermal permeation may also be attributed to the fact that at the pH (45) chosen for transdermal studies, acetylsalicylate was only 9, 09 % unionised. A higher degree of unionised species results in higher flux values. This study has confirmed that transdermal flux is dependent on several factors including optimum solubility, partitioning, diffusion and the degree of ionisation in the stratum corneum in addition to a suitable partition coefficient and high aqueous solubilily. The solution to the increased transdermal delivery of lipophilc drugs does not simply lie in producing a derivative with a higher aqueous solubilily and more ideal partition coefficient. Other means of increasing the transdermal permeation of lipophilic acetylsalicylic acid derivatives will have to be investigated in further studies. Master...|$|E
