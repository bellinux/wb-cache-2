5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups,</b> or {{may take}} the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E

5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups,</b> but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} was first named in 1904, it was {{included}} in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. M.escalerai is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike M.nattereri, which lives <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> in tree holes, M.escalerai forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{importance}} of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity {{has recently been}} emphasized in the gifted education in science because of the increased needs to foster the human resources that could explore through the communication and collaboration. In this study, we investigated {{the characteristics of the}} verbal interaction according to the learning styles of the gifted-students in science <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity and examined how learning style affected the interaction within a group in order to seek an effective grouping strategy. The competition, cooperative, and dependent students with learning style <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 and the cooperative, cooperative, dependent students <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were assigned by the 6 science high school stu-dents. The analyses of the results revealed that the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 showed the asymmetric interaction of the low level, whereas the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 showed the symmetric interaction of the high level. In other words, the frequencies of in-depth interaction <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were higher than those <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1, and also students <b>in</b> the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were equally involve...|$|R

5|$|Common ways to {{implement}} the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing 'good citizenship' and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.|$|E

5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>groups.</b> It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris.

Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E
