5|$|In 2009, five Merlin Mk3s were {{operating}} <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan,</b> transporting troops and supplies.

The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings {{to be withdrawn}} from the region in October 2011.

5|$|In October 2001, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that it}} was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against al-Qaeda and the Taliban <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR's main role <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and Taliban positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.|$|E

Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government {{did not expect to}} do most of the fighting <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b>|$|E
