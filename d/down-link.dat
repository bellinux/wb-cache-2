50|$|The {{communications}} system will provide reliable data connection between ground {{station and the}} satellite. The main objective is downloading data and uploading commands and firmware.In comparison to COMPASS-1, this mission will have a focus on channel coding and adaptive modulation {{in order to improve}} the amount of data transferred during each flyover. This also includes smart software at the ground station for signal processing. On the classic VHF-UHF-Bands we implemented new modulation methods to provide a higher data rate while staying compatible to default ham radio equipment. Besides there will be a S-Band <b>down-link</b> giving a <b>down-link</b> speed of about 500 kbit/s.|$|E
50|$|UMTS-TDD uses time {{division}} duplexing, allowing the up-link and <b>down-link</b> {{to share the}} same spectrum. This allows the operator to more flexibly divide the usage of available spectrum according to traffic patterns. For ordinary phone service, you would expect the up-link and <b>down-link</b> to carry approximately equal amounts of data (because every phone call needs a voice transmission in either direction), but Internet-oriented traffic is more frequently one-way. For example, when browsing a website, the user will send commands, which are short, to the server, but the server will send whole files, that are generally larger than those commands, in response.|$|E

50|$|The {{multiple}} access methods used in GSM with GPRS {{are based on}} frequency division duplex (FDD) and TDMA. During a session, a user is assigned to one pair of up-link and <b>down-link</b> frequency channels. This is combined with time domain statistical multiplexing which {{makes it possible for}} several users to share the same frequency channel. The packets have constant length, corresponding to a GSM time slot. The <b>down-link</b> uses first-come first-served packet scheduling, while the up-link uses a scheme very similar to reservation ALOHA (R-ALOHA). This means that slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) is used for reservation inquiries during a contention phase, and then the actual data is transferred using dynamic TDMA with first-come first-served.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary UMTS uses UTRA-FDD as an air {{interface}} {{and is known}} as UMTS-FDD. UMTS-FDD uses W-CDMA for multiple access and frequency division for duplexing, meaning that the up-link and <b>down-link</b> transmit on different frequencies. UMTS is usually transmitted on frequencies assigned for 1G, 2G, or 3G mobile telephone service in the countries of operation.|$|E

Mission controllers operate the spacecraft remotely from the Mission Operations Center at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The combined data rate is about 130 Mbit/s (150 Mbit/s with overhead, or 300 Msymbols/s with rate 1/2 convolutional encoding), and the craft generates approximately 1.5 terabytes of data per day (equivalent to downloading around 500,000 songs).|$|R
50|$|Referring to {{the design}} of COMPASS-1, the design of COMPASS-2 will be very close to the old one, but with {{improvements}} and extensions. We will use just one transmit frequency. Due to the arbitrary modulation system, it's just the onboard software that defines the service. The uplink will be in the 2m amateur radio band (145 MHz - referring to the 2 m band plan) receiving FM modulated data packets and DTMF commands as a backup. The <b>down-link</b> will be on the 70 cm amateur radio band (437 MHz - referring to the 70 cm band plan). On the <b>down-link</b> data frequency {{we will be able to}} send packet data, SSTV still picture images, Morse code and maybe some short voice messages. The Morse code transmission is elementary necessary for receiving the status directly after the deployment out of the launch pod, recovering the satellite and long time health measurement of the satellite. Nearly every radio amateur is familiar to Morse code, so it is possible to get telemetry from every part of the world.|$|E

The solutions use image compression (psycho-visual) coupled with new methods of receiving and processing information distributed across the planet. The project aims by 2014 to photograph all of the continents in color at a resolution of 1 meter, every week, with a constellation of 13 Earth-orbiting microsatellites at 600 km, imaging everything in their path and <b>down-linking</b> compressed data to processing centers on the world.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{requested}} {{and approved}} a quotation for {{the integration of}} a receiving ground station, the Alaska SAR Facility, at UAF. The Alaska SAR Facility was marked at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on April 24, 1991. Later that year, the facility began <b>down-linking</b> European Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (ERS-1) data. The expected data volume for the station was 45 minutes total from ERS-1, JERS-1 and RADARSAT. In the operations stage, data flow rapidly increased due to changing requirements from flight agencies and government sponsors, and storage of online data and demand for SAR data was expected to rapidly exceed capacity. The Satellite-Tracking Ground Station launched in 1990, and in 1994 a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NASA and UAF formed the ASF Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). The facility was renamed the Alaska Satellite Facility in 2003.|$|R

50|$|Analog {{and other}} smart {{repeaters}} {{that do not}} have the network friendly cognitive functions to safely repeat mobile phone signals will not be authorised. Analog and other smart repeaters are general broadband amplifiers that boost mobile signals of all base stations without control. For example, signals are boosted from these base stations, which cause uncontrolled signal levels on the <b>down-link</b> and up-link. Phone signals on the up-link may be over amplified which cause high levels of Gaussian noise and/or inter-modulation which causes the base station/s capacity to severely drop or fail.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} signal of the up-link, of relatively high power (1, 2,or 5 watts for common VSAT equipment) originating from BUC (block up converter), {{and the very}} low power received signal power (µV) coming from the antenna (aerial) to the LNB receiver unit, in this case are at an angle of 90° relative to each other, are both coupled together at the feed-horn focal-point of the Parabolic antenna. The device that unites both up-link and <b>down-link</b> paths, which are at 90° to each other, is known as an Orthogonal Mode Transducer OMT.|$|E

40|$|Introduction This {{white paper}} {{addresses}} {{the behavior of}} Raman amplifiers when subject to bursty traffic. Bursty traffic is defined as traffic where the string of zeros can last from nanoseconds to seconds. Such bursty traffic might arise if sensors or satellite <b>down-links</b> input are placed directly on glass fibers. In a normal telecommunications scenario, the traffic is more-or-less smooth due {{to the use of}} synchronous optical network (SONET) framing, which uses coding to restrict the number of adjacent bits that can be zeros. However, for future government networks or high-end educational networks the expense and complexity of the SONET multiplexers may be removed. In the future, even commercial networks may want to run packet traffic such as IP directly on glass as well, again thereby avoiding the expense of SONET multiplexers. When bursty traffic is run directly onto the fiber networks, one of the major problems arises from the optical amplifiers that are used in wavelength divisio...|$|R
40|$|The Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE) is a JPL-led, New Millennium Program mission {{containing}} {{new technology}} {{in the form of}} software to be flown on the Earth Observer- 1 (EO- 1) satellite in early 2004. This new technology will facilitate an artificially intelligent machine with autonomous science-driven capabilities. Among the ASE flight software is a set of onboard science algorithms designed for autonomous data processing, primarily based on change detection from observation to observation. Using the output from these algorithms, ASE has the ability to autonomously modify the EO- 1 observation plan, retargeting itself for a more in-depth observation of a scientific event in progress. Furthermore, intelligent and selective information <b>down-linking</b> will maximize return of the most valuable scientific data. Among the algorithms developed for use on ASE is a Lava-Vegetation (L-V) detection algorithm. This algorithm can effectively identify the initial location and extent of lava and vegetation coverage based on spectral shape. Comparison of several different observations, all classified via this algorithm, can make change detection possible...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{free space}} {{communications}} are an efficient approach to transmit high data-rates with small antennas and {{low power consumption}} over large distances. Possible scenarios are links between satellites, up- and <b>down-links</b> from and to ground stations {{as well as all}} kinds of links between aeronautical vehicles. The links that involve propagation of the electro-magnetic wave through the atmosphere are critical. Here, signal quality may be degraded severely due to wave-front distortions. With the exploitation of adaptive optics these wave-front distortions can be compensated and system performance enhanced. In the framework of this thesis, a laboratory testbed is built up which offers the scientist a comfortable support for the development and test of techniques related to adaptive optics and free-space optical communication. The core components are a hot-air optical turbulence generator, a deformable mirror, and a Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor.
