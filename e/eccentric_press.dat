Nicol and colleagues [70] likewise found that supplementation with curcumin (5  g/day) for 5  days moderately reduced post-exercise pain during 48  h of recovery and blunted the CK flux caused by 7 [*]×[*] 10 <b>eccentric</b> single-leg <b>presses</b> (five sets at 120 % 1 RM, two sets at 100 % 1 RM) in recreationally active men, though post-exercise interleukin 6 (IL- 6) was elevated relative to placebo. A similar study [68] reported that CK, TNF-α, and IL- 8 responses were blunted in untrained males and females who consumed curcumin (400  mg/day) for 2  days prior to and 4  days after damaging exercise (6 [*]×[*] 10 <b>eccentric</b> leg <b>press</b> repetitions, 110 % 1 RM).

40|$|Abstract. The semisolid {{processing}} {{technology is}} not widely used {{due to the}} high cost of raw material and the equipment it requires. New low-cost raw materials and processes could be the key to expand the use of this technology. This paper describes an initial effort to develop new Al-Si-Mg in terms of raw material production and processing. The morphological evolution of all the alloys produced was characterized during their reheating to the semisolid state at 45 and 60 % solid fraction, as well as the semisolid behaviour in terms of viscosity versus shear rate. The adaptation of the semisolid technology to the thixoforming process via <b>eccentric</b> <b>press</b> was tested using an equipment up to 25 tons. This type of equipment is not commonly employed in this kind of processing. Results indicate that alloys with low silicon content, e. g., 2 or 4 wt%Si, behave similarly to alloys with 7 wt%Si, which are normally used in the thixoforming process, with a viscosity of about 2 * 10 5 Pa. s. The semisolid behaviour of low silicon alloys indicates the potential expansion of the range of raw materials for this application. Thixoforming of semisolid materials in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>press</b> appears to be a very promising technology, yielding parts that, despite their simplicity and restricted shape, display a very good final mechanical behaviour...|$|E

40|$|This project {{describes}} the improvement process of a simulation model for mechanical presses with Dynamic Drive Chain® kit (DDC) developed by ABB SA. <b>Eccentric</b> mechanical <b>presses</b> use a wheel of inertia {{combined with a}} clutch to descend, stamp and finally climb {{back to the top}} dead centre. In them, there is a limitation on the cycle time given by the speed at which the stamping is performed. This speed is defined by the quality of the stamp to be obtained and {{is directly related to the}} speed of the wheel, which is almost unchanged during the cycle. DDC kit is a system that includes an additional press servomotor to provide control over the speed of ascent and descent of the slide and thus, reduce its cycle time and obtain other benefits. Since the birth of DDC, a model was available to run simulations but it was difficult to adjust and the precision of the results was low. For that reason, it was decided to develop a new model that better represented the real system, in order to obtain more accurate results and, consequently, better define the requirements and specifications of new press systems. During this project, it was analysed the operation of mechanical presses and DDC to then, perform a mathematical modelling of the different components and dynamics that characterize them. Once these models were developed, they were implemented in MATLAB®. This software offers a very powerful tool called Simulink, which serves as a basis for performing simulations and has been very useful when carrying out this project. Next step was model validation.
