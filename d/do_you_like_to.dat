6000|$|... "My {{friend here}} {{tells me you}} want {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> help a Quaker lady with her housework, just out of town?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How?' 'Can't <b>you</b> feel it <b>does?</b> <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{go back to}} {{bare feet}} again, same as last year, would you? Not really?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jilted me! I don't {{care what}} the world knows. Am I {{to put up with}} such {{treatment}} as that and do nothing? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see your cousin treated in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|L. ANNE. [Touching the trousers] They are hard. James's {{are much}} softer; aren't they, James? [JAMES deigns no reply] What shall we <b>do?</b> Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see my bedroom? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could we not pay him {{rent for}} the house," [...] said Lily, [...] "as Mrs Hearn <b>does?</b> <b>You</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> remain here, mamma, if <b>you</b> could <b>do</b> that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. <b>Do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> me, but <b>you</b> cannot silence my thoughts. I learned {{them from}} Jesus Christ, {{who made a}} terrible joy, {{and sent it to}} {{overturn}} governments, and all settled order.|$|R
6000|$|Markheim {{was looking}} upon {{him with an}} indefinable expression. 'You ask me why not?' he said. 'Why, look here--look in it--look at yourself! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see it? No! nor I--nor any man.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'That is {{all very}} well,' I said at last, as I heard Duroc muttering his threats. 'You may <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> him when <b>you</b> get the upper hand. At present the {{question}} rather is, what {{is he going to}} do to us?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So be it, Now, {{here we are}} at Stamford town; and I must to my trade. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see fighting, Alftruda,--the man's game, {{the royal}} game, the only game worth a thought on earth? For you are {{like to see a}} little in the next ten minutes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{see how it}} is, Lucy--the {{thing is}} not to be found. It is mislaid, the Lord knows where, and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> avow it." ...|$|R

6000|$|Thus a {{whole year}} passed, {{and when it was}} over the troll called him home, for he was now in his power like all the other animals.
