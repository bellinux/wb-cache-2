5000|$|In August 2006 Steve Crim of C and S Net, Inc. Filed for a U.S. Patent {{to protect}} {{technology}} {{specifically designed for}} attaining first party leads. This patent, USPTO #7,904,335 {{is described as a}} [...] "Website Lead Generator," [...] a more detailed explanation defines it as [...] "An Internet marketing system which can generate a user contact <b>information</b> <b>window</b> in a non-intrusive manner. The user contact <b>information</b> <b>window</b> allows the user to enter his or her contact information, which is then transmitted to the operators of the web site so that they can contact the user at a later time." [...] According to Crim, this patent, which was awarded on March 8, 2011, was {{a long time in the}} works.the first known website system to generate car leads in an automated way via a website was created by Mark Bonfigli in 1996 with the first version of an automated lead generating website that later became part of the dealer.com web platform. This automated lead generating website would actually not only create a first party lead but it would follow up with a customer and update them when vehicles they were interested arrived into inventory. This was called CarFinder and FindmyCar.|$|E

The system allows the student to design and study electric circuits by placing symbolic cards representing resistors on a board. Then this board is overlaid by a 3 D virtual circuit with its electrical components. Finally, this virtual circuit is coupled back to reality by lighting up a real bulb with intensity depending on the chosen layout. In addition, the mathematical relationship between current, resistance and voltage (Ohm's law) is presented in an <b>information</b> <b>window...</b>|$|E

With the application of DSP digital signal processing technology to design this flow {{measuring system}}, it achieves accurate measurement of fluid flow in pipe.

30|$|To {{test the}} {{proposed}} method, {{we developed a}} cell coverage estimation program which has a map of an urban (Gangnam) area in South Korea. The test area has a total of 47, 439 grids and we collected complete ref. Cell-ID and RSSI (i.e., fingerprint) data by actual wardriving. The cell coverage estimation program includes all the collected fingerprint data of the grids and the position data of cell sites. The positions of cell sites were obtained using an information database from a commercial WCDMA system. In addition, the cell coverage estimation program contains the position information of the relay stations. All the information for grids, cell sites, and relay stations are shown in a map and <b>information</b> <b>window</b> of the cell coverage estimation program. The area shown in the map window can be moved by simple mouse drag operations. The function of map panning in/out is implemented by simple menu directions.|$|E
40|$|Mentor: Dr. Sc. Bujar TAFASeeing journalism {{from the}} {{historical}} perspective {{is able to}} represent the developments of a country at its best.

But, in the case of â€˜â€™Rilindjaâ€™â€™ newspaper, this role is deeper than this, for the fact that for many ongoing decades â€˜â€™Rilindjaâ€™â€™ was the only body of press in Albanian all over the former Yugoslavia. â€˜â€™Rilindjaâ€™â€™ devotedly took after permanently memorizing different political, social, economical, sportive developments that Albanians of Kosovo and those around have gone through.

40|$|Accurate feature {{detection}} in both imagery (scalar data) and model output (scalar and vector data) {{is required to}} verify model accuracy based on real, observed conditions. After applying an appropriate {{feature detection}} algorithm, modelers {{would like to see}} the features represented visually. Merely having a list of features and corresponding statistical information can be useful, but viewing the features graphically and employing a simple point-and-click GUI for selecting, highlighting, and editing a feature is preferable. It can be useful to both focus on an individual feature and to show a feature in context with other features. With this in mind, we have developed EddyInfo for Ocean Modelers. EddyInfo allows for visualizing and editing eddies. It was designed around the time-varying component of our eddy detection results and currently contains three windows: a main graphics window, a spreadsheet window, and an <b>information</b> <b>window.</b> While the results we present here are in the context of eddies, EddyInfo's methodologies could be applied to other applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During the {{construction}} phase, {{participants in a}} multi-contract project acquire external real-time scheduling information from other involved parties and use this to make appropriate decisions in regard to project control. There are two major obstacles to project participants gaining efficient access to external information in a distributed data environment: (1) the variety of data structures that project members may use, and (2) lack of an automatic mechanism for data acquisition. Based on the ontology defined by eXtensible markup language Schema (XML Schema) and an automatic mechanism called Message Transfer Chain (MTC), an Electronic Acquisition Model for Project Scheduling (e-AMPS) centralized in an information agent, Message Agent (MA), was developed. Each participant equips a Message Agent as his unique <b>information</b> <b>window</b> to automatically acquire external information and provide other participants with scheduling information as well. The ultimate goal {{of this study is}} to build an automatic communication environment for multi-contract projects to solve the abovementioned difficulties, and thus achieve effective communication among project participants...|$|E
40|$|The paper applies an {{algorithm}} for recursive {{estimation of}} variables and parameters in general dynamic networks {{that has been}} developed by [Brdys 99] to robust on-line monitoring of the mixing water quality in dynamic water networks. A complete hydraulic information {{is assumed to be}} available on-line. First a parsimonious parametrisation of a mathematical model of mixing quality is derived. Next a recursive estimation algorithm is designed that uses the model and available measurements to generate on-line robust estimates of unknown quantities. The parameters and variables are estimated simultaneously. Robustness of the estimates is achieved through non-probabilistic set-bounded modelling of uncertainty in the measurement and modelling errors. The stable and tight bounds on the estimated quantities are obtained by employing a concept of moving <b>information</b> <b>window.</b> The estimation scheme is very flexible in integrating the information available. In particular, if only concentrations of the quality parameters in a network inputs are measured, the estimator operates as the quality simulator under uncertain models and not accurately known inputs. This {{can be viewed as a}} sort of generic soft sensor. Performance of the monitoring scheme is illustrated by applications to two case-study networks...|$|E
