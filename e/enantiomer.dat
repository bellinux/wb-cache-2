5|$|The {{naturally}} occurring <b>enantiomer</b> of RNA is D-RNA composed of D-ribonucleotides. All chirality centers {{are located in}} the D-ribose. By the use of L-ribose or rather L-ribonucleotides, L-RNA can be synthesized. L-RNA is much more stable against degradation by RNase.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one <b>enantiomer</b> can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
5|$|Research on {{the drug}} given to the trial {{participants}} reveals {{it to be a}} chiral chemical, with two <b>enantiomer</b> forms; one is the harmless and beneficial Proloft, the other is the dangerous hallucinogen which Black and the others ingested. Dr Miller tells Black that he had been working on drugs to cure his own visions, which he believes are similar to Black's. One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after he ran into the road amidst oncoming traffic, almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room.|$|E

The <b>enantiomers</b> were separated on Chiralpak IC (2503 4. 6 mm, 5 mm) in normal phase HPLC. Three in-termediates were all baseline separated (RS 5 2. 84, 2. 58 and 3. 58, respectively).

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one <b>enantiomer</b> of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an <b>enantiomer</b> of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E
25|$|The (S)-(+) <b>enantiomer</b> of {{mirtazapine}} {{is responsible}} for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(–) <b>enantiomer</b> {{is responsible for}} antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and α2-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) <b>enantiomer</b> is the stronger antihistamine.|$|E
50|$|In {{stereoisomers}} {{the bond}} structure is the same, but the geometrical positioning of atoms and functional groups in space differs. This class includes <b>enantiomers</b> which are non-superposable mirror-images of each other, and diastereomers, which are not. <b>Enantiomers</b> always contain chiral centers and diastereomers often do, {{but there are}} some diastereomers that neither are chiral nor contain chiral centers. Another type of isomer, conformational isomers (conformers), may be rotamers, diastereomers, or <b>enantiomers</b> depending on the exact compound. For example, ortho- position-locked biphenyl systems have <b>enantiomers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Enantiomers</b> {{differ in}} the {{direction}} of their optical rotation of polarized light, and are therefore sometimes described as optical isomers. However this term is ill-defined and has also been used to describe other stereoisomers as well as <b>enantiomers.</b> Its use is therefore strongly discouraged and the molecules should instead be described as either <b>enantiomers</b> or diastereomers as appropriate.|$|R
50|$|The two R-configuration <b>enantiomers,</b> i.e. (4R,5S) and (4R,5R), of methylphenylpiracetam {{are more}} active {{positive}} allosteric modulators of the sigma-1 receptor {{than the two}} S-configuration <b>enantiomers,</b> i.e. (4S,5R) and (4S,5S).|$|R
25|$|Deprenyl is a racemic compound, {{a mixture}} of two isomers called enantiomers. Further work {{determined}} that the levorotatory <b>enantiomer</b> was a more potent MAO-inhibitor, {{which was published in}} 1967, and subsequent work was done with the single <b>enantiomer</b> L-deprenyl.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} {{virtually}} all other simple phenylethanolamines (β-hydroxy-phenethylamines), the (R)-(−)-, or l-, <b>enantiomer</b> of synephrine is more potent than the (S)-(+)-, or d-, <b>enantiomer</b> in most, {{but not all}} preparations studied.

25|$|At {{this point}} in the {{synthesis}} of Taxol, the material was a racemic mixture. To obtain the desired <b>enantiomer,</b> allylic alcohol 4.9 was acylated with (1S)-(−)-camphanic chloride and dimethylaminopyridine, giving two diastereomers. These were then separated using standard column chromatography. The desired <b>enantiomer</b> was then isolated when one of the separated disatereomers was treated with potassium bicarbonate in methanol.|$|E

40|$|Chiral {{molecules}} are {{molecules that}} behave as image and mirror image to each other; these are also called <b>enantiomers.</b> There is a demand in pure <b>enantiomers,</b> {{which can be}} created {{for the use of}} a variety of industries, such as drugs for the pharmaceutical industry or herbicides for agrochemistry. ANDREAS SEIDEL-MORGENSTERN and his research team investigate access to these pure <b>enantiomers.</b> To achieve this, they work on separating the two <b>enantiomers,</b> complementing alternative approaches devoted to synthesize just one of them. For this, they use racemic mixtures – which contain equal amounts of left- and right-handed <b>enantiomers</b> of a chiral molecule – and then split these racemates. The separation process they managed to develop for this, as is described in this video, allows them to produce larger quantities of pure <b>enantiomers</b> from cheap available mixtures than was possible before. This means that these can now also be produced more effectively in industrial contexts...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of stereochemistry in drug action is gaining greater attention in medical practice, and a basic {{knowledge of the}} subject will be necessary for clinicians {{to make informed decisions}} regarding the use of single-enantiomer drugs. Many of the drugs currently used in psychiatric practice are mixtures of <b>enantiomers.</b> For some therapeutics, single-enantiomer formulations can provide greater selectivities for their biological targets, improved therapeutic indices, and/or better pharmacokinetics than a mixture of <b>enantiomers.</b> This article reviews the nomenclature for describing stereochemistry and <b>enantiomers,</b> emphasizes the potential biological and pharmacologic differences between the 2 <b>enantiomers</b> of a drug, and highlights the clinical experience with single <b>enantiomers</b> of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and citalopram. In some cases, both a mixture of <b>enantiomers</b> and a single-enantiomer formulation of a drug will be available simultaneously. In these cases, familiarity with stereochemistry and its pharmacologic implications will aid the practicing physician to provide optimal pharmacotherapy to his or her patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was the preparation of inclusion complexes of amlodipine base and its besylate salt with hydroxy propyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBC) to improve the dissolution and to investigate the stereospecific dissolution of amlodipine <b>enantiomers.</b> The prepared inclusion complexes were characterized by FTIR and DSC. Significant improvement in the dissolution was found with S and R <b>enantiomers</b> of amlodipine base where as no improvement was found with <b>enantiomers</b> of amlodipine besylate (p > 0. 05) after complexation with HPBC. This indicates the formation of inclusion complexes with only <b>enantiomers</b> of amlodipine base (p 0. 05). Stereospecific dissolution was observed with pure <b>enantiomers</b> of amlodipine base when its inclusion complexes were prepared by solvent evaporation method with l: 1 and 1 : 2 molar ratios but not with 1 : 3 molar ratio...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{molecules}} may be chiral. This {{implies that}} they can appear in two mirror images. Both mirror images, also known as <b>enantiomers,</b> can exhibit different biological activity. For example, (S),(S) -ethambutol is the drug against tuberculosis, while the mirror image (R),(R) -ethambutol causes blindness. Thus, {{it is essential to}} administer only (S),(S) -ethambutol to the patient and not a mixture of the <b>enantiomers.</b> There are several ways to obtain <b>enantiomers</b> purely, the most common being racemic (as a mixture) synthesis followed by separation of the <b>enantiomers.</b> The traditional separation methods have their limitations and {{there is a need for}} new technology. In this thesis, research on enantioselective liquid-liquid extraction, a promising technology for separation of <b>enantiomers,</b> is discussed. Hereto, the racemate is dissolved in a suitable solvent and contacted with a second, immiscible liquid with therein the host or extractant. This host selectively binds one of the <b>enantiomers.</b> After separation of the liquids, both are enriched in one of the <b>enantiomers.</b> A centrifugal contactor separator (CCS) was used for the process. The results show that the compact CCS equipment is very suitable for continuous operation of the enantioselective extractions. The main strength of using continuous CCS equipment is that for initial screening and kilogram scale production the same equipment can be applied. ...|$|R
