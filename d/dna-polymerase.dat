The model according to which the translocation of the <b>DNA-polymerases</b> proceeds {{as a result of the}} duplex section transition located inner DNA-connecting channel of the enzyme from A- into B-form on the conformal adjustment stage of the substrate dNTP molecule in the active centre has been proposed. A number of the NTP and dNTP derivatives carrying the residues of the fluoroscent dyes or photo-activated groups connected over position C 5 of the pyrimidine or C 8 of the purine nucleotides has been synthesized. It has been shown that the synthesized analogs are the substrates of different DNA- and PNA-polymerases and can be used for creation of the corresponding labeled polynucleotides and study of the different DNA- and PNA-polymerases of the viruses, procaryotes, eucaryotes and their complexes with other proteins.

The inhibitory activity of these derivatives against <b>DNA-polymerases</b> isolated from avian myeloblastosis virus, E. coli and calf thymus were studied at various conditions. 3 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenylhydrazone-(methyl) rifamycin SV {{is a strong}} inhibitor for all the polymerases tested and belongs to the C class inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. 3 -(monoallylhydrazone-(methyl) rifamycin SV possesses a selective action on polymerases: at 0. 1 mg/ml concentration it almost completely inhibits the reverse transcriptase and {{less than half of}} the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes. A drug is found which strongly inhibits the <b>DNA-polymerases</b> from E. coli and calf thymus and weakly the viral enzyme. The inhibitory effect on reverse transcriptase is independent of the choice of template-primer; it could be overcome by the addition of excess enzyme but not of excess template-primer; the inhibition could be completely reversed by dilution of the drug-enzyme mixture. From Lineweaver-Burk analysis, the inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to the template-primer and, thus the drugs bind to the site different from the active site for the template-primer. From protective action of the template-primer and other data it might be suggested that the rifamycin derivatives act at an early step(s) in DNA synthesis catalyzed by reverse transcriptase. The obtained data are in agreement with the results for other derivatives of rifamycin SV described in literature...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{its early}} characterization, {{it quickly became}} {{apparent}} that polymerase I was not the enzyme responsible for most DNA synthesis—DNA replication in E. coli proceeds at approximately 1,000 nucleotides/second, while the rate of base pair synthesis by polymerase I averages only between 10 and 20 nucleotides/second. Moreover, its cellular abundance of approximately 400 molecules per cell did not correlate {{with the fact that}} there are typically only two replication forks in E. coli. Additionally, it is insufficiently processive to copy an entire genome, as it falls off after incorporating only 25-50 nucleotides. Its role in replication was proven when, in 1969, John Cairns isolated a viable polymerase I mutant that lacked the polymerase activity.

It typically consists of two consecutive HhH motifs that are linked by a connector helix and displays pseudo- 2 -fold symmetry.

40|$|Abstract Background Molecular {{mechanisms}} generating {{genetic variation}} {{provide the basis}} for evolution and long-term survival of a population in a changing environment. In stable, laboratory conditions, the variation-generating mechanisms are dispensable, as there is limited need for the cell to adapt to adverse conditions. In fact, newly emerging, evolved features might be undesirable when working on highly refined, precise molecular and synthetic biological tasks. Results By constructing low-mutation-rate variants, we reduced the evolutionary capacity of MDS 42, a reduced-genome E. coli strain engineered to lack most genes irrelevant for laboratory/industrial applications. Elimination of diversity-generating, error-prone DNA polymerase enzymes involved in induced mutagenesis achieved a significant stabilization of the genome. The resulting strain, while retaining normal growth, showed a significant decrease in overall mutation rates, most notably under various stress conditions. Moreover, the error-prone polymerase-free host allowed relatively stable maintenance of a toxic methyltransferase-expressing clone. In contrast, the parental strain produced mutant clones, unable to produce functional methyltransferase, which quickly overgrew the culture to a high ratio (50 % of clones in a 24 -h induction period lacked functional methyltransferase activity). The surprisingly large stability-difference observed between the strains was due to the combined effects of high stress-induced mutagenesis in the parental strain, growth inhibition by expression of the toxic protein, and selection/outgrowth of mutants no longer producing an active, toxic enzyme. Conclusions By eliminating stress-inducible error-prone <b>DNA-polymerases,</b> the genome of the mobile genetic element-free E. coli strain MDS 42 was further stabilized. The resulting strain represents an improved host in various synthetic and molecular biological applications, allowing more stable production of growth-inhibiting biomolecules. </p...|$|R

The relative significance of these factors varies with the reaction conditions, particularly with the length of the template and the concentration ratio of enzyme (reverse transcriptase or other DNA polymerase) to primer. It is concluded that potent inhibition of HIV-reverse transcriptase activity under typical in vitro and in vivo conditions arises from different features of the interaction of chain terminators with the enzyme. A new method of testing for the parameter important under in vivo conditions is suggested...|$|E
