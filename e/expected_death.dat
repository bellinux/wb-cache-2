40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite methodological {{concerns}} Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratios (HSMRs) are promoted as measures of performance. Hospitals that experience {{an increase in}} their HSMR are presented with a serious challenge but with little guidance on how to investigate this complex phenomenon. We illustrate a simple penetrating approach. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of routinely collected hospital admissions data comparing observed and <b>expected</b> <b>deaths</b> predicted by the Dr Foster Unit case mix adjustment method over three years (n = 74, 860 admissions) in Shropshire and Telford NHS Trust Hospital (SaTH) constituting PRH (Princess Royal Hospital) and RSH (Royal Shrewsbury Hospital); whose HSMR increased from 99 in the year 2008 / 09 to 118 in the year 2009 / 10. RESULTS: The step up in HSMR was primarily located in PRH (109 to 130 vs. 105 to 118 RSH). Disentangling the HSMR by plotting run charts of observed and <b>expected</b> <b>deaths</b> showed that observed deaths were stable in RSH and PRH but <b>expected</b> <b>deaths,</b> especially at PRH, had fallen. The fall in <b>expected</b> <b>deaths</b> has two possible explanations-genuinely lower risk admissions or that the case-mix adjustment model is underestimating the risk of admissions perhaps because of inadequate clinical coding. There {{was no evidence that}} the case-mix profile of admissions had changed but there was considerable evidence that clinical coding process at PRH was producing a lower depth of coding resulting in lower expected mortality. CONCLUSION: Knowing whether the change (increase/decrease) in HSMR is driven by the numerator or the denominator is a crucial pivotal first step in understanding a given HSMR and so such information should {{be an integral part of}} the HSMR reporting methodology...|$|R
