5|$|Ernest learned cavalry {{drill and}} tactics under Captain von Linsingen of the Queen's Light Dragoons, and {{proved to be}} an {{excellent}} horseman as well as a <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> After only two months of training, Freytag was so impressed by the Prince's progress that he gave him a place in the cavalry as captain. Ernest was supposed to receive infantry training, but the King, also impressed by his son's prowess, allowed him to remain with the cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and {{the best in the}} Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} a runner, heavyweight boxer, rugby footballer, billiards player and a <b>good</b> <b>shot.</b> A {{commission}} agent in business, he was an amateur musician and an exhibitor of roses. He died in Hull Infirmary, after falling from an express train near Brough, aged 48. He is buried in Hornsea Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|James Butler Hickok {{was born}} May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois (present-day Troy Grove, Illinois) to William Alonzo Hickok, a farmer and abolitionist, {{and his wife}} Polly Butler. His father {{was said to have}} used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the Underground Railroad. He was the fourth of six children. William Hickok died in 1852, when James was 15. Hickok was a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> from a young age and was {{recognized}} locally as an outstanding marksman with a pistol. Photographs of Hickok appear to depict dark hair, but all contemporaneous descriptions affirm that it was red.|$|E
25|$|Other {{aircraft}} types {{featured in}} the film include the biplane Curtiss SBC Helldiver (no relation to the SB2C {{of the same name}} and manufacturer), Brewster F2A Buffalo (in long shots), and one <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> of a Douglas SBD Dauntless. For security reasons, no bombs or torpedoes are shown. Several of the squadrons featured, and undoubtedly many of the aircrew, such as Bombing Squadron 6 of the Enterprise, later played critical roles at the battles of Coral Sea, Midway, and other World War II engagements. A rare pair of shots are the landing on and subsequent launch from the Enterprise in its pre-war livery, filmed from an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Likewise {{there are}} {{different}} versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by {{a man with a}} double-barreled shotgun, and studied the movements of birds as they were shot. In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at Prouts Neck while his neighbor Will Googins, fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore. However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted Defiance, a Civil War subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 A <b>Good</b> <b>Shot,</b> Adirondacks, which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of Right and Left.|$|E

25|$|The Cougars {{opened the}} season at home, hosting the Northern Illinois Huskies, who played a very {{physical}} game, with the visitors from the Mid-American Conference racking up 14 fouls and 3 yellow cards. In the 17th minute, the normally stingy SIUE defense turned over the ball on a straight giveaway that NIU's Molina took and passed to Voss, who fired a booming shot from 25 yards out that left Dal Santo no chance for a save, and the Huskies took a 1–0 lead that held through halftime. The Cougars returned from the break fired up and working hard for a shot. When the Huskies were called for a handball inside the 18 yard box in the 57th minute, Ledbetter stepped up and fired in the penalty shot to tie the score. For the remainder of regulation time and through two extra time periods, the two offenses jockeyed to find a <b>good</b> <b>shot,</b> and the defenses turned away attack after attack. After 110 minutes, the game ended in a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E
25|$|After {{close to}} a month without {{international}} cricket, Australia toured India for two Tests and three one-day games in October, in {{what would be the}} team's last Test series ahead of the summer's Ashes in Australia. Haddin again failed to recover sufficiently for the series and Paine was named wicket-keeper. In a drawn three-day first-class match before the Test series, Paine scored a slow 45 and zero; failing to capitalise on his promotion to four in the batting order for the second innings. Returning to the traditional wicket-keepers spot of seven for the Test series, Paine battled to his highest Test score, 92 from 196 balls, in the first innings of the First Test in Mohali. In hot conditions, he displayed <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> selection and concentration, despite suffering from cramp in the latter stages of his innings. Still, when Australia was bowled out soon after his dismissal, Paine assumed wicket-keeper duties for India’s innings, where he took two catches. In his team's second innings, however, Paine scored only nine, as Australia collapsed to set India a target of 216 runs. They achieved the score with just one wicket remaining; Paine taking one catch. After the Test, Melbourne newspaper The Herald Sun, wrote an article saying that Paine could become Australia's future Test captain. The Second Test saw him continue his good form with the bat, scoring 59 and 9, but Australia lost the match and the series 2–0. Afterwards, former Australian wicket-keeper Rodney Marsh suggested {{it would be hard for}} Haddin to regain his spot in the Australian team for the Ashes. India won the opening one-dayer and therefore took the series 1–0 when rain washed out the remaining two matches. Paine struggled in the match, compiling 9 from 24 balls.|$|E
60|$|Bullets--Sportsmen, {{fresh from}} England, and {{acknowledged}} as <b>good</b> <b>shots</b> at home, begin by shooting vilely with balls at large game. They {{must not be}} discouraged at what is a general rule, but be satisfied that they will soon do themselves justice.|$|R

500|$|Sweatt {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenseman, possessing a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and a tendency to join plays deep in the opposing zone. He has {{played the role of}} powerplay [...] "quarterback" [...] on teams throughout his career – controlling the play by either passing or shooting the puck. Defensively, he is known to play aggressively, hitting opposing players. Due to his offensive capabilities at a comparatively small size for a defenseman at 5 feet and 9inches, he has been compared to former NHL player Brian Rafalski.|$|E
500|$|Randazza {{filed an}} appeal on June 5, 2007, and {{the matter was}} {{scheduled}} for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Acworth told Orlando Weekly he considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO.

500|$|After {{calling a}} number of minor {{witnesses}} (including the cab driver {{and the owner of}} the building Williams and Seymour lived in), the prosecution called Edgar Power. Power testified that Williams had bragged about shooting Walls in response to Powers' chaffing him about being a poor shot. According to Power, Williams responded to the chaff by saying, [...] "Well, that was a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> anyhow," [...] referring to the shot that had killed Walls. Williams' barrister Hastings later described Power as [...] " [...] utterly contemptible human being I have ever met," [...] and during his cross-examination Hastings highlighted Power's betrayal of his close friends, Williams and Seymour.|$|E

500|$|The {{concerns}} over the castle were significant. Francis Godolphin, {{who at the time}} was renting Tresco from the Crown, commented {{at the end of the}} century that the castle could not defend the island as [...] "it neither discovereth the whole harbour so through the iminent height thereof can make no <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> so steep downwards", and also complained about its fortification, [...] "which is worst, is of so weak form as it cannot be defended". Partially in response to these problems, the new Star Castle was constructed on St Mary's island between 1593 and 1594; a more modern, well-positioned design, Star Castle rapidly became the key defensive site in the Scilly Isles.|$|E
500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Marquis was {{now having}} some {{publishing}} success, including fiction in Lariat Story Magazine, non-fiction in Century Magazine (an article about Oscar <b>Good</b> <b>Shot,</b> an Oglala Sioux), {{and his first}} work of fiction not related to Indians, [...] "The making of a garage doctor" [...] in The American Motorist. However, he was clearly still torn concerning his future. The importance of Leforge and White to his writing career was not yet clear, and Marquis continued {{to look at other}} options. Besides his application to the Veteran's Bureau, he also looked for a post as agency physician (he was still practicing privately). Unable to get a post on the Crow reservation, he applied for a post with the Western Shoshone in Nevada. He changed his mind after some writing success and declined the post when it was offered, only to change his mind again and request the post. However, it was no longer available.|$|E

After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now.

500|$|Macaulay {{displayed}} a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow {{described him as}} an unusual man, [...] "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy... A cricket-bag came {{between him and his}} blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." [...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a <b>good</b> <b>shot</b> from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with him for years. Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E
