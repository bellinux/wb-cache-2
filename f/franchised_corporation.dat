40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer an {{explanation}} for the practice of dual distribution. the simultaneous use of franchises and company owned outlets for distributing new products. Our explanation rests on the observation that franchisors often acquire private information, not available to franchisees, on product demand through marketing efforts. Under this assumption of asymmetric information, we show that a franchisor will use both direct ownership as well as the franchise contract to convey information about a new product. This explanation for dual distribution relies neither on capital market imperfections nor upon location-specific factors, in contrast to alternative explanations advanced in the literature Testable implications of the signaling model are discussed. <b>Franchises,</b> <b>corporations,</b> marketing, private information...|$|R

[...] "The Secrets Of Callanetics" [...] featured detailed instructions on how {{to get the most out}} of the Callanetics exercises. The release was small and limited to the US market. It was Pinckney's final video. Due to management and financial issues, the Callanetics <b>Franchise</b> <b>Corporation</b> collapsed at the end of 1994. It was at this time that Pinckney decided to enter permanent retirement. The strain of constant promotion and the stress of the Franchise collapse were taking their toll on her. She wanted time alone to recuperate and relax. The fame and fortune that came with the success of Callanetics was never important to Pinckney. She was first and foremost a teacher. It was teaching that she loved. To see the changes in her students bodies was the most important thing to her. To know that she was having a positive impact on their lives gave her so much joy.|$|R

50|$|Pinckney was now {{dividing}} {{her time}} between New York and Savannah. She was inundated with requests for classes and teachers. In November 1990, Pinckney decided {{to set up}} a franchise for Callanetics studios and introduce a proper teacher training program. She had been receiving reports from around the world that classes were being taught by people with no training or authorization to teach the Callanetics method. Pinckney opened the Callanetics <b>Franchise</b> <b>Corporation</b> with headquarters in Denver, Colorado. From here teachers were trained and licences were given for studios across the country. As Pinckney was spending more and more time in Savannah there was a need for a new studio in Manhattan. She was approaching 50 and now wanted to concentrate her efforts on training new teachers and ensuring the quality of her exercises were upheld. A studio was found in the attic of Carnegie Hall. Pinckney chose dedicated student Ruth Jeffries to run the new Callanetics Studio of Manhattan. A studio in Chicago followed with eight more opening across the US in the next year.|$|R
50|$|With the {{conception}} of the Callanetics <b>Franchise</b> <b>Corporation</b> in Denver, Pinckney was becoming less involved in teaching students. Her love of writing and making videos was now her priority. Her next book, Super Callanetics, gave her the chance to give a more in depth explanation of the advanced exercises seen in the earlier video of the same name. This was followed in 1992 by the “Quick Callanetics” video and book series. In them Pinckney demonstrated three short programs each aimed at toning a different area {{of the body in}} only 20 minutes. They were a huge success. Pinckney was starting to realise that more and more people were working longer days and just did not have the time to dedicate a full hour to exercising. Her solution to this in 1993 was “AM/PM Callanetics”, a program consisting of two daily routines to shape up the entire body. The book and accompanying video contained a 25-minute morning routine to energize participants for the day and a 25-minute evening routine to relax them for the night.|$|R

40|$|This article {{suggests}} that, as {{an antidote}} to the ever-tightening restrictions on individual environmental standing, a state may charter a not-for-profit corporation organized to protect a particular environmental resource, giving the corporation a non-exclusive portion of the State 2 ̆ 7 s interest in enforcing applicable environmental protections. The dichotomy between not-for-profit organizations that may litigate only as the representative of individual members 2 ̆ 7 interests, and business corporations that assert their own direct economic interests, may seem natural to our late-twentieth-century sensibility, but is not founded in original intent. The framers of Article III, which grants jurisdiction over “cases and controversies” to the federal courts, would have seen the latter day business corporation as something of an oddity. Most incorporated entities during the eighteenth century were religious institutions, municipalities, and government franchisees. In fact, the now ubiquitous business corporation did not become commonplace until the early nineteenth century, as government <b>franchise</b> <b>corporations</b> expanded to include incorporation of private businesses. To the framers, then, the concept of a corporate entity asserting community interests in natural resources on its own behalf would have been no more alien than the concept of a corporate entity asserting private business interests...|$|R

50|$|In May 1991 the Callanetics <b>Franchise</b> <b>Corporation</b> {{received}} its first requests from {{people wanting to}} set up studios in England and Scotland. Former dancer Mary Adams had trained with Pinckney in her New York studio in the mid 1980s. She had met Pinckney after {{a friend of hers}} suggested she try Callanetics to help with her dance-related injuries. Adams decided to become a teacher and open the first Callanetics Studio in the UK. Based in a former car showroom in Glasgow the studio was an instant success. The concept of a studio teaching Callanetics was difficult to sell to the bank manager though. Adams struggled to secure a loan for the setup fees. Despite the success of the Callanetics books and videos, she was faced with men in suits telling her it was only a passing fad and she would never make a success of it. Adams utilized every contact she could find. One of those was a former school friend who happened to be a bank manager. She persuaded him to actually lie on the floor and try the exercises for himself. This was all the convincing he needed. Within a year the loan was paid off and Adams opened a second studio in Edinburgh.|$|R
50|$|While Dio's {{appeal in}} his {{bankruptcy}} fraud conviction was pending, he was indicted for securities fraud. According to prosecutors, Dio and Anthony Di Lorenzo, heir-apparent to the Genovese crime family, conspired to purchase 28,000 shares of Belmont <b>Franchising</b> <b>Corporation,</b> a substantially worthless over-the-counter stock. Dio, Di Lorenzo and others opened accounts at numerous brokerages under false names, and purchased shares of Belmont from themselves and from each account {{in an attempt}} to inflate the price. They agreed to sell the stock to other investors, and then share the proceeds (estimated at $1 million) among themselves. Lucchese crime family member Michael Hellerman, who was part of the conspiracy, turned state's evidence and entered the federal witness protection program. At trial, Dio was not only accused of running the stock fraud scheme but also of beating the original owner of the shares in order to get him to sell the securities to Dio for just pennies. Midway through the trial, a high-level aide to Senator Hiram Fong (R-Hawaii) pleaded guilty to charges he had attempted to quash the federal government's inquiry into the case. Dio's defense attorney argued that Hellerman, the government's chief witness, could not be believed, and the jury agreed—finding Dio not-guilty on July 12, 1972.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Given a set S {{of sites}} and a setO of {{weighted}} objects, an optimal location query finds the location(s) where introducing a new site maximizes the total {{weight of the}} objects that are closer to the new site than to any other site. With such a query, for instance, a <b>franchise</b> <b>corporation</b> (e. g., McDonald’s) can find a location {{to open a new}} store such that the number of potential store customers (i. e., people living close to the store) is maximized. Optimal location queries are computationally complex to compute and require efficient solutions that scale with large datasets. Previously, two specific approaches have been proposed for efficient computation of optimal location queries. However, they both assume p-norm distance (namely, L 1 and L 2 /Euclidean); hence, they are not applicable where sites and objects are located on spatial networks. In this article, we focus on optimal network location (ONL) queries, i. e., optimal location queries in which objects and sites reside on a spatial network. We introduce two complementary approaches, namelyEONL (short for Expansion-basedONL) and BONL (short for Bound-based ONL), which enable efficient computation of ONL queries with datasets of uniform and skewed distributions, respectively. Moreover, with an extensive experimental study we verify and compare the efficiency of our proposed approaches with real world datasets, and we demonstrate the impor-tance of considering network distance (rather than p-norm distance) with ONL queries...|$|R
