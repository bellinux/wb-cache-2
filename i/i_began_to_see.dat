25|$|People who {{had started}} {{rebuilding}} their lives after World War <b>I,</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in Padre Pio a symbol of hope. Those close to him attest {{that he began to}} manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, bilocation, levitation, prophecy, miracles, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only the Eucharist without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of tongues, the gift of conversions, and the fragrance from his wounds.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an {{attractive}} ensemble—sailors, whalers, girls {{who worked in}} the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans—a libel I was anxious to refute... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. [...] Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Cagney's {{politics}} {{started to}} change. He {{had worked on}} Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential campaigns, including the 1940 presidential election against Wendell Willkie. However, {{by the time of}} the 1948 election, he had become disillusioned with Harry S. Truman, and voted for Thomas E. Dewey, his first non-Democratic vote. By 1980, Cagney was contributing financially to the Republican Party, supporting his friend Ronald Reagan's bid for the presidency in the 1980 election. As he got older, he became more and more conservative, referring to himself in his autobiography as [...] "arch-conservative". He regarded his move away from liberal politics as [...] "a totally natural reaction once <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> undisciplined elements in our country stimulating a breakdown of our system... Those functionless creatures, the hippies ... just didn't appear out of a vacuum." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{disengaged}} {{herself from}} his arm, and sat {{close to him}} upon the floor. [...] "I think I can see what you will do," [...] she said. She mused. [...] "For the first time <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things {{as they may be}} for us. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a life ahead. For the very first time." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2000, Bartley and ÓBriain {{had been}} promised [...] "exclusive access" [...] to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, [...] "We had... this notion of {{investigating}} Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here {{is a guy who}} is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as more transparent—what {{you see is what you}} get." [...] Bartley and ÓBriain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and ÓBriain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to [...] "press the right buttons" [...] to gain his support, so they presented [...] him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general Daniel Florence O'Leary, irish who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O'Casey. Slowly, Bartley and ÓBriain gained their subjects' trust, [...] "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".|$|E
2500|$|A longer {{exploration}} of his faith {{can be found}} in an interview with Third Way Magazine. There he says that [...] "I was brought up as , but I was not in any real sense a practising one until I went to Oxford. There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its social relevance. I began {{to make sense of the}} world".|$|E
2500|$|The Times David Chater commented {{positively}} on {{the episode}} [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", writing that: [...] "Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective {{in what it}} sets out to do, although – like so much television at Christmas – you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect." [...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It sounds a bit strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - when <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the morning, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's when I really began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by the geographic scope of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E

6000|$|The doctor {{pulled his}} arm {{over his eyes}} and sat down again. Presently he was saying with a long face: [...] "I came here to {{denounce}} the cause of your unhappiness, and <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it is myself." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the end {{to which}} the notes were drifting. Instead of {{answering}} his question, I entreated him {{to enter into the}} explanations that were still wanting to convince my own mind. He held up a warning forefinger, and stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|... "What would, miss?" [...] he asked, simply. [...] "I'm a rough man, and I've led a rough life. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{things now}} that I never saw before. What would give Bertha {{standing}} {{among the people}} you speak of?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And {{you like}} the voyages long? <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> sir. Just as they're getting near to where the {{treasure}} ain't, a little accident like {{the loss of their}} water-supply sends them into port and out again to start hunting all over." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} {{householders}} of Muizenburg, St. James's, and Kalk Bay complain {{of the difficulty}} of keeping beer or good servants at the seaside, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the reason.

60|$|I {{looked up}} at the balcony. There was a face hanging over the red plush rail. It looked to me as if it had some hidden sorrow. I'd noticed it before, when we were dancing around, and I had {{wondered}} what the trouble was. Now <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I was very {{willing to be}} easy, and that to carry family {{concerns}} before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse.
