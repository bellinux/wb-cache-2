How to understand repositories in a comprehensive, unbiased manner? To answer this question, we describe institutional repositories as systems, characterizing their components, <b>environmental</b> <b>items,</b> and structuring bonds. Our approach is the abstraction of those elements from a literature review guided by Mario Bunge's composition-environment-structuremechanism system model. The selection of sources is opportunistic, seeking to cover the origins of social facts according to Bunge: environmental, bio-psychological, economic, political, and cultural. The procedures include individually marking components, <b>environmental</b> <b>items,</b> and bonds in the source text, then discussing those markings in group to generate a consensus marking and its consolidation in a system model. Here we report on a pilot study of the abstraction technique using a single source text.

Understanding the behaviour-specific environmental correlates associated with commuter walking will help effective interventions to be identified and developed. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the associations of perceptions of the environment in the workplace ‘neighbourhood’ and commuter walking. Participants in the baseline survey of the Walking Works intervention study reported perceptions of ten environmental attributes in their workplace neighbourhood, availability of public transport, time spent walking to and from work in the last seven days, their participation in physical activity and socio-demographic characteristics (n= 676). We built a series of multivariate logistic regression models to examine associations between each <b>environmental</b> <b>item,</b> public transport availability and commuter walking. Half (52 %) of respondents were classified as commuter walkers (n= 352) (66 % female; 47 % aged < 30 years). Respondents were significantly more likely to walk for their daily commute if they reported there to be convenient walking routes (OR (odds ratio) 2. 05, 95 % CI (confidence interval) 1. 23 – 3. 42), suitable pavements (OR 2. 23, 95 % CI 1. 23 – 4. 04), maintained pavements (OR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 2. 62) or convenient public transport (OR 4. 98, 95 % CI 3. 34 – 7. 44) after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, free car parking at work and distance lived from work. Creating ‘pedestrian friendly’ environments in workplace surroundings may be important for encouraging walking {{for the daily}} commute to work.

The requirements of the Dutch government for admission of pesticides to the market are included in the Manual. As they are not reported exhaustively, it is advised to consult the CTB Application Form, if felt necessary. This Manual focusses primarily on instructions with respect to studies on behaviour in water and soil, ecotoxicity for aquatic and terrestrial organisms, and bioconcentration for aquatic organisms. The instructions cover both the intrinsic reliability of test reports provided by the industry, and the summarised description of these reports in an Advisory Report of RIVM. The latter is prepared by the Department of Evaluating Environmental Aspects of Pesticides on behalf of the Dutch Board for the Authorisation of Pesticides (CTB). This Board has the responsibility for admitting or refusing pesticides on the Dutch market in view of the Pesticides Act. A distinction has been made between the reliability and usefulness of tests. The first refer to intrinsic aspects of a test - methodology, description -, the latter to the use of such a test for a particular purpose - e. g. risk assessment. In this Manual the emphasis is on the reliability, and it offers a check-list per <b>environmental</b> <b>item</b> to discriminate between reliable, less reliable and not reliable tests.

The yields of paddy-rice, potato, and orange were considered. All the data employed in the quantification analyses were collected from the Dojo-kankyo-kiso-chosa (soil survey for improved utilization and conservation of soil resources) which was carried out as a national project from 1979 to 1987. The yield of paddy-rice was closely related to the items used in the study. Among the items, the most important item to control the paddy-rice yield was the <b>environmental</b> <b>items</b> of weather and physiography. Soil type (soil series) was well related to the averaged yield of paddy-rice under the same physiographic unit. The contribution of rice variety and rate of nitrogen fertilizer application to the yield was low compared with the contribution of soil type. Soil chemical properties hardly affected the paddy-rice yield. The correlation between the yield of potato and items was not so good. Items relating to environment less contributed to the yield than items relating to soil and management did. Among the items used, soil type, soil chemical property, and rate of nitrogen fertilizer application were important to control the potato yield. The yield of orange showed the higher correlation to the <b>environmental</b> <b>items</b> than to the soil and management items. The averaged yield of orange was well related to the physiographical environment, although the contribution of weather was not clear. The effect of soil chemical property on the orange yield was greater than the effect of rate of fertilizer and lime application. The phosphate-absorption coefficient of a soil may be a good index to the potential productivity classification of orange field consisting of Red-Yellow soils. 長崎県の土壌環境基礎調査(定点調査) の 1 巡目と 2 巡目(昭和 54 ～ 62 年度) の調査で得られた資料をもとに,水稲,ばれいしょ,みかんの収量を外的基準として数量化分析Ⅰ類を行い,これら作物の収量に対する環境,土壌および管理要因の相対的な寄与について評価した. 水稲収量には,気象および地文(地形･地質) 環境が強く影響した. 県レベルでの水稲収量は,この 2 つの要因によって予測されえた. 土壌要因の寄与は環境要因に比べて小さいものの,地域レベルの水稲収量は土壌統と一定の対応関係を示した. 水稲収量と土壌要因との関係では,土壌統や土壌統群など土壌型としての表示が,土壌の化学牲を用いるよりもうまく対応し,土壌統群は水稲品種や窒素施肥量など管理要因よりも強く水稲収量に関係した. ばれいしょ収量に対する環境要因の寄与は小さく,むしろ土壌要因がより強く関係した. 施肥量や品種も,相対的に大きい寄与をみせた. 土壌要因のなかでは,土壌統群と並んで士壌の化学性,特にリン酸吸収係数がばれいしょ収量と密接な関係を示した. 施肥量では窒素肥料の効果が最も大きかった. みかん収量は地文環境に依存し,地域ごとに平均みかん収量が予測されえた. 土壌要因のなかでは,土壌型の寄与が母材よりも大きく,土壌の化学性も一定の関係を示した. みかん収量には,肥培管理よりも土壌の化学性が大きく影響し,リン酸吸収係数が樹園地土壌の生産性を分級する場合のひとつの指標になると考えられた...|$|E

This study explores {{the impacts of}} physical <b>environmental</b> <b>items</b> (DINESCAPE) on emotions and behavioral intentions of customers at an upscale restaurant. The theoretical framework is grounded on the Mehrabian- Russell model which suggests that any environment will evoke {{one of the three}} emotional states: pleasure, arousal, and dominance. A field study approach is used in this study and conducted with 152 participants who were dining at a restaurant.
