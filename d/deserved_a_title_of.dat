30|$|The Human Genome Project (HGP), {{together}} with the Manhattan Project and Apollo program, were considered as the three greatest scientific projects of all time. Genome sequencing, or DNA sequencing, has {{had a profound impact}} for researches in life science and medicine, and directly spurred the emergence of multiple new fields, such as genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics/computational biology, and systems biology. So we can (perhaps arguably) regard the DNA sequencing as the most important technique in 20 th century. Also, the fourth greatest project, the Precision Medicine Project, was started in 2011 with a solid foundation from HGP. Since Dr. Wu first developed the DNA sequencing methodology, and established the primer-extension principle, “father of DNA sequencing” should be <b>a</b> correct <b>title</b> for him. And his contributions can at least be comparative to Dr. Sanger, who made great contributions on determining both protein and DNA sequencing and is <b>deserving</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> “the emperor of sequencing”. Taken together, when we introduce the contributions of Dr. Sanger in DNA sequencing, we really have to add the information that based on the primer-extension approach developed by Dr. Wu, and Dr. Sanger further refined the methodology and {{played an important role in}} DNA sequencing. Dr. Wu’s contribution should not be and hopefully will not be neglected.|$|R
50|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock over the WWF Championship. At No Mercy, Rock {{defeated}} British Bulldog in a standard wrestling match. Later that night, Rock challenged {{the winner of the}} WWF Championship Anything Goes match between Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin for the title. After issuing the challenge, Rock was attacked by Triple H with a sledgehammer. Later that night, Triple H defeated Austin to retain the title. On the October 18 episode of Raw, Rock challenged Triple H to a match for the title at Survivor Series, because Rock was angered at the previous night's attack. Austin also issued a challenge and claimed that he <b>deserved</b> <b>a</b> <b>title</b> shot instead <b>of</b> Rock. The WWF Chairman Vince McMahon solved the situation by making a Triple Threat match between Triple H, Austin and Rock for the WWF Championship.|$|R
