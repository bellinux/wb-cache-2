40|$|The two novel dihydropyridines, {{oxodipine}} and <b>elgodipine</b> greatly depressed the KCl-induced {{contraction of}} rabbit aorta and decreased the cardiac force of contraction of rat ventricular strips with lower potency. Both compounds markedly shortened cardiac action potentials. In rat cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, oxodipine and <b>elgodipine</b> decreased the L-type Ca 2 + current (I-CaL) with IC 50 of 0. 24 and 0. 33 mu M respectively while oxodipine was slightly more potent on the T-type Ca 2 + current (I-CaT) than <b>elgodipine</b> (IC 50 = 0. 41 vs. 2. 18 mu M) Both compounds were less potent in inhibiting I-CaL of adult cardiomyocytes. Oxodipine exhibited mostly a tonic block of both currents while <b>elgodipine</b> induced mainly a use-dependent block. Oxodipine and <b>elgodipine</b> increased {{by at least}} one order of magnitude their inhibitory potency on I-CaT and I-CaL when the cells were partially depolarized. We conclude that the mechanisms of inhibition of Ca 2 + channels by these two dihydropyridines are different and suggest that the underlying mechanism of vascular selectivity is the voltage-dependent block of I-CaL, with the use-dependent inhibition of Ca 2 + currents by <b>elgodipine</b> further contributing to this selectivity.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} <b>elgodipine,</b> a new second-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on hemodynamics and coronary artery diameter were investigated in 15 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected coronary artery disease. Despite {{a significant decrease}} in systemic blood pressure, <b>elgodipine</b> infused at a rate of 1. 5 micrograms/kg/min over a period of 10 minutes did not affect heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The contractile responses during isovolumic contraction showed a slight but significant increase in maximum velocity (56 +/- 10 to 60 +/- 10 seconds- 1; p less than 0. 005), whereas the time constant of early relaxation was shortened from 49 +/- 11 to 44 +/- 9 ms (p less than 0. 05). Coronary sinus and great cardiac vein flow increased significantly by 15 and 26 %, respectively. As mean aortic pressure decreased, {{a significant decrease in}} coronary sinus (- 27 %) and great cardiac vein (- 28 %) resistance was observed, while the calculated myocardial oxygen consumption remained unchanged. In all, 69 coronary segments (including 13 stenotic segments) were analyzed quantitatively using computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography. A significant increase in mean coronary artery diameter (2. 27 +/- 0. 53 to 2. 48 +/- 0. 53 mm; p less than 0. 000001), as well as in obstruction diameter, (1. 08 +/- 0. 29 to 1. 36 +/- 0. 32 mm; p less than 0. 02), was observed. The results demonstrate that <b>elgodipine,</b> in the route and dose described, induces significant vasodilatation of both coronary resistance and epicardial conductance vessels, without adverse effects on heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand and contractile indexes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we first {{investigated}} the cardiovascular actions of several classes {{of drugs in}} conscious pigs in which heart failure was induced by occluding a coronary artery 3 - 4 weeks before the studies were performed and compared the results to those observed in normal conscious animals. Positive inotropic agents and vasodilators are frequently used to treat heart failure as they may improve the depressed myocardial contractility and lower the elevated systemic vascular resistance. In chapter 2 and 3 {{the effects of the}} 1. 4 - dihydropyridine derivative calcium antagonists nisoldipine and <b>elgodipine</b> are studied because of their capability to unload the heart by reducing systemic vascular resistance in normal anesthetized pigs (Duncker et al., 1986 and Sassen et al [...] 1990) and by increasing cardiac output in normal conscious pigs (Duncker et aL, 1987). To study the potential advantage of vasodilators with positive inotropic properties to vasodilators alone we also investigated the actions of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pimobendan with nisoldipine in the porcine model for heart failure (Chapter 4). In chapter 5 we describe the effects of a novel class of drugs which causes systemic vasodilation by potassium channel activation. The results of bimakalim are compared to the nicotinamide derivative nicorandil, which in addition to their nitrate-like properties, also possess potassium channel activator properties (Taira, 1989). One of the most prominent drugs in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease is nitroglycerin, despite the frequent occurrence of tolerance. In chapter 6 we first evaluated 5 novel nitrate-esters in normal conscious pigs. In the second part nitroglycerin and one of the novel compounds, CEDO 8956, were selected for further study of distribution of cardiac output in conscious pigs with chronic coronary artery occlusion. Tachycardia is an unwanted situation, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Selective bradycardic agents, which exert an anti-ischemic effect because of their ability to reduce oxygen demand and improve oxygen supply of the myocardium and especially of the subendocardial layers (Schamhardt et aL, 1981, Krumpl eta!., 1988 and lndolfi et a!., 1989), may thus have some benefit in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, provided that the negative chronotropic properties are not accompanied by negative inotropic properties. We therefore studied the effects of UL-FS 49, a specific bradycardic agent and compared the results to those of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolo...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} some {{therapeutic}} aspects of experimentally induced {{coronary artery disease}} are being highlighted. In chapter 2 {{the effects of the}} Ca 2 • antagonist diltiazem on the progression of coronary and aortic atherosclerosis in pigs is being studied. So far, studies on the anti-atherosclerotic effects of this drug (Ginsburg et al., 1983; Naito et al., 1984; Sugano et al., 1986; Dicciani et al., 1987; Sugano et al., 1988) have only been performed in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit and in only one study (Ginsburg et al., 1983) also the effect on coronary atherosclerosis was investigated. However, hypercholesterolemic rabbits develop atherosclerosis in the small intramyocardial branches rather than in the large epicardial coronary arteries, as observed in man and in swine. Furthermore, in these studies the doses used were so high that they would never be tolerated by man. Besides a medicamentous regimen, dietary intervention may also present a possible way of dealing with atherosclerosis. In chapter 3 the regression of porcine atherosclerotic lesions and the effects of dietary flsh oil on this process have been investigated. Myocardial ischemia has been mimicked in anesthetized pigs by creating a concentric stenosis by inflating a balloon placed around the vesseL Several therapeutic approaches have been explored (chapters 4, 6, 8 and 10). The effect of a low dose of the Ca 2 + antagonist nisoldipine (chapter 4) and L-propionylcarnitine (chapter 6) on ischemic and postischemic blood flow and function have been investigated. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to predict long term outcome of stunned myocardium by means of two markers for long term recovery: the post systolic wall thickening (Takayama et al., 1988) and Ca 2 + uptake and phospholamban phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Schoutsen et al., 1989). The reflex-mediated tachycardia, as observed in conscious (Duncker et al., 1987 a), but also in anesthetized animals (Duncker et al., 1986) may, in myocardial ischemia, render a potential detrimental effect of vasodilators such as the Ca 2 + -antagonists. In chapter 5 the cardiovascular profile of the newly developed Ca 2 +-antagonists <b>elgodipine</b> has been surveyed. In chapter 7 the global and regional cardiovascular effects of nicorandil were investigated while in chapter 8 the drug was tested for its anti-ischemic potential. As indicated, nicorandil is a compound with nitrate-like actions, but it has also been shown that the cardiac effects and possibly in part the vasodilating property, are mediated by K+ channel activation. In chapter 9 we investigated the cardiovascular effects of a selective K+ channel activator for comparison with those of nicorandil. Despite new developments, B-adrenoceptor-antagonists remain important for the treatment of myocardial ischemia. In this respect the cardioselective type of £adrenergic antagonists are of particular interest. One such drug is bisoprolol (Harting et al., 1986), a compound that has been shown to exert pronounced cardiovascular actions at doses considerably lower than required to inhibit the isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate and contractility (Duncker et al., 1987 b). In chapter 10 its effects on contractile function and myocardial flow in ischemic porcine myocardium are described...|$|E
