25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing shit about me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> their resistance." ...|$|E

[...] In December 2012, I travelled from the mid-west of Nepal to India’s capital, Delhi, to attend a two-week course entitled “International Procurement and Supply Chain Management”. [...] I walked away with a suitcase of information and resources! ... I want to thank Medical Service Ministries and their supporters for the funding that enabled me to attend this course. [...] On our missionary living allowance, it just wouldn’t have been possible to afford the course, so <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> this opportunity.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The fan outcry and {{subsequent}} discussions over Lexa's death led several screenwriters and producers {{to sign the}} Lexa Pledge, a pledge promising to treat gay and lesbian characters in future plotlines with consideration to their emotional and cultural impact. Some have argued that this stifles creativity {{and the freedom to}} develop characters and stories, while others have welcomed the debate, even if they have not signed the pledge. Although Rothenberg said he was [...] "very sorry for not recognizing [...] as fully as [...] should have", he would have still killed off Lexa; he would have written {{it in a way that}} does not perpetuate the trope, such as death after sex. He said that while he understands the argument that Lexa should have had a heroic death, having such a powerful character die by a stray bullet was more realistic because it signifies that anyone can be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Javier Grillo-Marxuach, who wrote the episode, said, [...] "I don't think that the failure here was to discuss , the failure was to recognize the cultural impact it would have outside the show [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the tidal wave that came down on me. The activism that goes on online is [...] important." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Stephen," [...] said Sybil, [...] "dear Stephen, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> {{your kind}} feelings: but indeed {{this is not}} the time for such passages: cease, my friend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{naturally}} {{replied that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> his lordship's intercession; and that, outside monkish offices, there <b>was</b> nothing <b>I</b> {{would not do}} to merit his kindness. He told me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to report myself to your nephew, who would inform me {{of the nature of}} the service upon which <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> at first, to be employed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know much, {{and that}} 's {{the reason why}} <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your {{kindness}} to Will. I don't care what stories they tell about you, <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> sure, you won't lead him into trouble, but keep him straight, for my sake. You know I 've lost one brother, and Will takes Jimmy's place to me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me!" [...] she cried, {{looking up}} at him with real respect in her face, and real remorse smiting her conscience. [...] "Forgive me! I have misled you and myself. I tried to love you: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your regard, touched by your fidelity, and I hoped I might repay it; but I cannot! I cannot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} as much as I had hoped for, Dias, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your {{willingness}} {{to do what you}} can for us, just as you did for Señor Barnett." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your {{offer of}} 100,000 men, but as at present advised I do not {{consider}} that Washington is in danger, or {{that there is any}} emergency requiring 60 or 90 days men.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] said Agatha, smiling. [...] "Sometimes it {{was very}} hard; I should not have taken this holiday only that I wanted {{to get used to}} the lakes and woods. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> all you have taught me." ...|$|E
40|$|In The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction, I {{aimed to}} start a conversation, not end one. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thus <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the {{generosity}} of the many fine scholars who in the preceding pages have graciously accepted the invitation to converse. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> especially <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the extraordinary hospitality of the University of Richmond Law Review, which has kindly given a home to this conversation...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>grateful,</b> <b>for</b> Maria and {{the saints}} have not {{forgotten}} me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not without my pleasures in captivity." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{very lonely}} child, with no playmates or companions of any sort, and my girlhood was lonelier still. The only passion {{in my life}} was my love for my father. I would have done and {{suffered}} anything to win his affection in return. But all I ever did win was an amused tolerance--and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that--almost content. It was much {{to have something to}} love and be permitted to love it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{any desire}} to better your condition, Ramdass? I owe you, too, {{so much that it}} would greatly please me to be able, in some way, to show that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the shelter you gave me for so many years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maud Barrington smiled curiously. [...] "You and I and {{a handful}} of others stand alone, but I told you I would not blame you whether we won or lost. Do you know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the glimpses of the realities of life that you have given me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Leonore. Take this ring, and I {{will trust}} whoever thou mayst send with it.

Farewell, old Norna; watch thou above the helpless, and thine old age shall be made happy by my care.|$|E
60|$|Somehow, {{her stories}} began to affect me {{in spite of}} myself. There <b>were</b> times when <b>I</b> felt very dreary. Perhaps Aunt Philippa was right. Perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy. Certainly Mark had {{forgotten}} me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ashamed of myself because this hurt me so much, but I could not help it. I grew pale and listless. Aunt Philippa sometimes peered at me sharply, but she held her peace. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> this.|$|R
2500|$|Clinton {{obtained}} a B.A. degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001. The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove. At {{the time of}} Chelsea's graduation, President Clinton issued a statement saying, [...] "Hillary and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, {{and we are very}} proud of her on this special day." ...|$|R
60|$|When I awoke {{again it}} was broad daylight; in fact, the sun stood {{high in the}} heavens. Perhaps Naya had put some drug into my milk, or perhaps I had simply slept. I do not know. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that sleep, for without it I think that I should have gone mad. As it <b>was,</b> when <b>I</b> remembered, which it took me some time to do, for a while I went near to insanity.|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{are only}} {{to remind you}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> what has been done. It isn't much of a present; but it will suffice to show I'm not ungrateful. Some time in the future I may meet you again, and then the full debt shall be paid if I'm solid enough to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruth and Mr. Winfield {{are both}} perfect types. Mr. Winfield {{is really a}} splendid {{specimen}} of a man. As to his intelligence, I say nothing. I have ceased to expect intelligence in man, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the smallest grain. But physically, he is magnificent. I could not wish dear Ruth a better husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your {{offer of}} assistance; {{but even that}} is no salve to wounded pride. For that matter, {{it is no more}} than one white man should expect from another. Shipwrecked mariners are always helped along their way. Only this {{particular}} mariner doesn't need any help. Furthermore, this mariner is not going to Sydney, thank you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} be buried alive," [...] said Yeovil. [...] "The news from the outer world was not of a kind that helped a despondent invalid towards convalescence. They spoke to me as little as {{possible}} about what <b>was</b> happening, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> your letters because they also told me very little. When one is abroad, among foreigners, one's country's misfortunes cause one an acuter, more personal distress, than they would at home even." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{must have}} a house large enough to be {{comfortable}} in," [...] I said. [...] "There's no reason why we shouldn't <b>be</b> comfortable." [...] <b>I</b> thought it as well not to confess my ambitions, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly relieved that she did not reproach me for buying the lot without consulting her. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> this unanticipated acquiescence, I felt nearer to her, than I had for a long time. I drew up another chair to my desk.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{they have}} evidently been {{very kind to}} him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> sorry to do the man any harm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only know}} that I am happy, Prue. Why {{it is so}} I cannot tell; but now I seldom have the old {{dissatisfied}} and restless feeling. Everything looks pleasant to me, every one seems kind, and life begins to be both sweet and earnest. It {{is only one of}} my moods, I suppose; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> it, and pray that it may last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maderstrom," [...] he said, [...] "you {{know quite}} well how {{personally}} I feel towards you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> {{what you have}} done for me, even though I am beginning to understand your motives. But as regards the other things we are both soldiers. I am going to talk to Helen for a time. I want to understand a little more than I do at present." ...|$|E

"Far from it, my lord; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the {{benefits}} which I decline, and I wish I could pay you for offering them, {{better than what}} I am now about to say." [...] The Lord Keeper {{looked at her in}} some surprise, but said not a word. [...] "My lord," [...] she continued, in an impressive and solemn tone, [...] "take care what you do; you are {{on the brink of a}} precipice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham," [...] I murmured. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> it, Miss Havisham!" ...|$|R
60|$|The few {{remaining}} {{days before the}} date of the eclipse passed by, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happy to say, uneventfully. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that. Excitements indeed had come so thick and fast during these late weeks that a little quiet was a welcome novelty. And the presence of our English friends from the gunboat gave us further a sense of confidence and security to which we had far too long been strangers. We knew now, at least, that a British war-vessel lay moored in the harbour below to watch over our safety.|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{therefore}} extremely <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.
