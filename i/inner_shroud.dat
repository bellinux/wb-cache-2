40|$|A {{compressor}} stage with a rotor tip speed of 1600 ft/sec was tested to evaluate its performance with a cantilevered stator and a rotating <b>inner</b> <b>shroud</b> beneath the stator. Both the rotor blades and the stator vanes were composed of multiple circular arc airfoil sections. Comparison of data taken during this {{test of the}} cantilevered stator and previous tests with the same compressor and airfoil geometry in a shroud stator configuration showed only slight differences in stage performance with no significant effect on overall efficiency.

40|$|This {{paper is}} objected {{to bring out}} an {{unbiased}} and detailed hydraulic response study in pumps as turbines due to blade rounding, <b>inner</b> and outer <b>shroud</b> rounding of the impeller inlet through high quality measurements of macroscopic parameters. To begin with a theoretical model is proposed where the hydraulic losses are categorized as flow zone and no-flow zone types, while suitable assumptions are made to the shaft and runner (Euler) torque. Four centrifugal pumps having specific speed {{in the range of}} 19 - 54 rpm are selected for this 3 -stage impeller rounding investigation. All pumps had backward vane impeller designs. The blade rounding showed greater reduction of flow zone losses compared to increase of runner torque resulting in an efficiency rise of 1 - 1. 5 %, while <b>inner</b> <b>shrouds</b> have shown evidence of decrease in losses but an inconsistent behavior of runner torque gains. The final rounding stage at the outer shrouds displayed traces of proof of non-flow zone hydraulic optimization. The consolidated rounding effects were compared to results of other researchers which again showed concurrence and consistency. The paper evokes a sentiment that the technique of fixed geometry optimizations of backward vane impeller has been saturated given that the maximum efficiency rise is only in the range of 1 - 2. 5 %., even though the total hydraulic losses constitute 25 - 30 % of the total energy (head) since the achieved best efficiency after modification ranges between 65 % and 75 %. Therefore, the paper recommends a calibrated methodology to change the backward vane angle so that the inlet relative velocity aligns with the blade and the strong wakes are reduced, which could reduce losses by 5 - 10 %. To conclude the paper pragmatically looks towards the limited scale of PAT application compared to pumping and proposes the study of rounding effects on pump operation {{to see if there is}} any positive alleviation of performance, which could have a greater benefit to industry and society.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a numerical and theoretical investigation of transitional and turbulent enclosed rotating flows, {{with a focus}} on the formation of macroscopic coherent flow structures. The underlying processes are strongly threedimensional due to the presence of boundary layers on the discs and {{on the walls of the}} outer (resp. <b>inner)</b> cylindrical <b>shroud</b> (resp. shaft). The complexity of these flows poses a great challenge in fundamental research however the present work is also of importance for industrial rotating machinery, from hard-drives to space engines turbopumps - the design issues of the latter being behind the motivation for this thesis. The present work consists of two major investigations. First, industrial cavities are modeled by smooth rotor/stator cavities and therein the dominant flow dynamics is investigated. For the experimental campaigns on industrial machinery revealed dangerous unsteady phenomena within the cavities, the emphasis is put on the reproduction and monitoring of unsteady pressure fluctuations within the smooth cavities. Then, the LES of three configurations of real industrial turbines are conducted to study in situ the pressure fluctuations and apply the diagnostics already vetted on academic problems...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} losses and secondary flows in three different turbine nozzle configurations in annular cascade. Appreciable outer shroud loss cores (passage vortices) were found to exist at the discharge of blades which had thickened suction surface boundary layers near the outer shroud. Blade designs having thinner boundary layers did not show such outer shroud loss cores, but indicated greater inward radial flow of low momentum air, in the wake loss is to this extent {{an indication of the}} presence or absence of radial flow. The blade wake was a combination of profile loss and low momentum air from the outer shroud, and the magnitude of the wake loss is to this extent an indication of {{the presence or absence of}} radial flow. At a high Mach number, shock-boundary-layer thickening on the blade suction surfaces provided an additional radial flow path for low momentum air, which resulted in large <b>inner</b> <b>shroud</b> loss regions accompanied by large deviations from design values of discharge angle.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America [© Acoustical Society of America] and is also available at: [URL] performance of traditional techniques of passive localization in ocean acoustics such as time-of-arrival (phase differences) and amplitude ratios measured by multiple receivers may be degraded when the receivers are placed on an underwater vehicle due to effects of scattering. However, knowledge of the interference pattern caused by scattering provides a potential enhancement to traditional source localization techniques. Results based on a study using data from a multi-element receiving array mounted on the <b>inner</b> <b>shroud</b> of an autonomous underwater vehicle show that scattering causes the localization ambiguities side lobes to decrease in overall level and to move closer to the true source location, thereby improving localization performance, for signals in the frequency band 2 – 8 kHz. These measurements are compared with numerical modeling results from a two-dimensional time domain finite difference scheme for scattering from two fluid-loaded cylindrical shells. Measured and numerically modeled results are presented for multiple source aspect angles and frequencies. Matched field processing techniques quantify the source localization capabilities for both measurements and numerical modeling output. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
40|$|During {{a typical}} startup cycle {{industrial}} gas turbine blades experience rapid radial thermal expansion while bulky shroud structure with larger thermal inertia requires much longer period {{to reach its}} operating temperature. Turbine designers have to leave a safe radial distance {{in order to prevent}} contact of blades to the surrounding annular casing. However, when thermal steady state in the turbine stage is achieved, shroud and casing grow and excessive amount of blade-shroud clearance remains. Engine efficiency is very sensitive to blade-shroud clearance. Just one millimeter of radial blade tip gap in fist stage turbine section of a 150 MW class engine leads to 4 % efficiency drop due to blade tip leakage. To achieve better efficiency or higher power, turbine blade tip clearance has to be controlled. Attempts to address blade tip clearance problem were not applicable as designs were bulky and complex which required excessive modification on the turbine hardware and design. The goal {{of this study is to}} design, analyze and develop a low-cost and compact actuator system which is capable of controlling the tip clearance up to 0. 25 mm at elevated temperatures. Actuator will be positioned between inner and outer shrouds of the casing to force the <b>inner</b> <b>shroud</b> radially away from the blades during transients, and allow it to come back towards the blades when casing reaches operating temperature to decrease the tip leakage during steady state. Different actuator designs have been studied and finite element analysis solutions have been obtained for deflection and stress. Low cycle fatigue life of the actuator has been estimated via Coffin-Manson criterion. An experimental setup has been designed and fabricated to validate the simulation results. Furthermore, since actuator will be subjected to wear at elevated temperatures due to mechanical loading and vibrations in the gas turbine, friction and wear behavior of candidate actuator materials has to be investigated. High temperature scuffing combined with rapid oxidation can lead to failures and dramatic reductions service life. Therefore, another experimental setup has been developed to conduct friction and wear tests of the candidate actuator materials, i. e. Nickel and Cobalt based superalloys Haynes 25, 188 and 214. The tests have been conducted at 20, 200, 400 and 540 °C. Overall, the results indicated that the compact actuator can achieve 0. 25 mm tip clearance reduction leading to 1 % efficiency increase for 880 startup cycles...|$|E
40|$|With {{ever-increasing}} {{demands for}} high efficiency in axial compressors, {{it has become}} important to consider more geometrical features of the manufactured component in the design phase. Many possibilities open if the level of fidelity of the computational model can be increased. A higher level of detail leads to enhanced performance of components, as {{the need to be}} conservative in the design phase is reduced. Better performance is important for reducing fuel consumption and the weight of the component and, consequently, decreasing the environmental impact. An axial compressor consists of rotating and stationary blade rows, where a distance between the rotating blades and the <b>inner</b> casing (<b>shroud)</b> is called the tip gap or tip clearance and is required to avoid contact of the blades with the shroud during engine operation. Large tip gaps in relation to the blade height can typically be found in the rear stages of transonic compressors. If the size of the tip gap is large in relation to the blade height, it can affect the flow in the rotor passage significantly. Including a tip gap in the optimization process of a compressor stage can therefore be of importance even in the early design phase to find geometries that will reach the design point at the design rotational speed. In this thesis, different turbulence models and wall modeling approaches are used to calculate the flow in a transonic compressor stage with a large tip clearance. The benefits of including the tip clearance in the optimization process of a transonic compressor are shown and discussed. It is shown that considering the tip clearance in the optimization process is important to be able to reach the specified design point. Furthermore, from the optimization results it is shown that redistribution of the flow as a result of blockage in the tip region impacts the design variables over the entire span...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, <b>shroud,</b> <b>inner</b> drum, and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The {{flow straightener}} consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} shroud plate. These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new experimental measurements, at conditions {{representative of}} an aero engine, of heat transfer from the <b>inner</b> peripheral surface (<b>shroud)</b> of a rotating cavity. The results {{are taken from}} the University of Sussex Multiple Cavity Rig, {{which is designed to}} be similar to a gas turbine high pressure compressor internal air system. The shroud Nusselt numbers are shown to be dependent on the shroud Grashof number and insensitive to throughflow axial Reynolds number. The magnitude of the shroud Nusselt numbers are consistent with accepted correlations for turbulent free convection from a horizontal plate, yet show a trend (gradient of Nusselt to Grashof numbers) that is similar to laminar free convection. A supporting high-resolution 3 D unsteady RANS simulation was conducted to investigate the cavity flow structure with particular attention paid to the near shroud region. This demonstrated flow structures that are consistent with published work but also show the existence of a type of Rayleigh-Bénard flow that manifests as a series of streaks that propagate along the periphery of the cavity. These structures {{can be found in the}} literature albeit in different circumstances. Whilst these streaks have been shown in the simulation their existence cannot be ratified without experimental confirmation...|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic shrouds {{have been}} {{designed}} and built for use in thermomechanical testing of samples of thermalinsulation panels on cryogenic vessels. In the original application for which these shrouds were specifically designed, the samples {{are representative of the}} large-area thermal-insulation panels on the space-shuttle external tanks that hold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and the purpose of the testing is to demonstrate the ability of bonded layers in the panels to resist delamination under a combination of applied uniaxial mechanical loads and realistic operational temperatures. Presumably, the shrouds and the tests performed by use of them could be modified to enable similar evaluation of thermomechanical properties of thermal-insulation panels for cryogenic vessels other than the external tanks of the space shuttles. The shrouds are required to enable maintenance of required temperatures on the inner and outer surfaces of the thermal-insulation-panel samples, to enable visual observation of the outer surfaces of the samples, and not to introduce any measurable loads into the panels. For each panel sample, there are two shrouds: one to be mounted on the inner surface (the surface that would be in contact with a tank containing a cryogenic liquid during normal use) and one to be mounted on the outer surface (the surface that would be exposed to ambient air or other warmer environment during normal use). The shrouds for testing specimens of thermal-insulation- panels for the liquid-hydrogen tank are made largely of titanium; the shrouds for testing specimens of thermal- insulation-panels for the liquid-oxygen tank are made largely of an aluminum- lithium alloy. The specific temperature requirements are the following: The <b>inner</b> <b>shroud</b> must make it possible to maintain a temperature of 321 degrees F (196 degrees C) [the approximate temperature of liquid nitrogen] or 453 F (about 269 C) [the approximate temperature of liquid helium] on the inner face of the sample. The outer shroud must make it possible to maintain a temperature between 30 degrees and 0 degrees F (between about 34 degrees and about 18 degrees C) on the outer surface of the sample by blowing a cryogenic gas or missile grade air along that surface. To enable viewing of the outer surface of the sample during testing, the outer shroud includes a window comprising two layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) with a gap between them to reduce fogging. To ensure that the shrouds do not introduce any measurable loads into a panel specimen, the shrouds are cushioned on the specimen by seals made of a fluoropolymer-membrane/fabric composite material and are held in place on the specimen by means of symmetrically placed clamps with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) pads. Instrumentation ports for thermocouples and strain gauges used in the tests are incorporated into the shrouds...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} 3 -stage research turbine at Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL) facility, Texas A & M University (TAMU) {{was replaced}} with a newly designed and manufactured 2 -stage turbine {{in accordance with the}} design requirements as per DooSan, DHI. This new design of turbine consisted of bowed stator and rotor blades to study the effect on reduction of secondary ow losses and thus improvement in turbine efficiency if any. The new design also incorporated labyrinth seals on both <b>inner</b> and outer <b>shrouds.</b> Extensive Inter-stage and Performance experiments were carried out on this new turbine. Inter-stage measurements were accomplished by traversing three 5 -hole probes radially and circumferentially, using the existing probe traverse system in TPFL. Performance tests were conducted for varying pressure ratio, at fixed rotational speed and for varying rotational speed with fixed pressure ratio and the efficiency was plotted against u/c_ 0. Each condition was tested and measured two to three times to check for reproducibility of the data. The results from inter-stage experiments show that the rotor row loss coefficient is about four times higher than the stator row loss coefficient. This high rotor loss coefficient reduces the total to static efficiency. From the performance tests, the maximum total-to-static efficiency observed was 85. 2 percent located at around u/c_ 0 = 0. 75. This relatively low efficiency is in consonance with the inter-stage results (high rotor loss coefficient) ...|$|R
40|$|Background and Research Purpose Hard {{disk drives}} (HDDs) {{are among the}} most widely spread data storage devices. The {{development}} of HDDs goes toward higher data densities and increased rotation speeds with a continuously growing demand for larger storage capacity and faster data access speed. On the other hand, the next generation of HDDs is expected to be smaller in size and to consume less energy. The distance between the read-and-write head and the disk surface reaches into the range of 10 nm for recently developed HDDs. The disk rotation entrains the surrounding air and lets three-dimensional complex flow structures develop in a HDD. The complex flow induces disk vibrations, which may lead irreparable damage to the disks. Many investigations have been reported on the disk vibrations or/and on the flow structures in a HDD, but the detailed mechanism of the flow-disk interaction remains still yet to be understood. The air flow in a HDD can be roughly divided into three different regions: <b>inner,</b> outer and <b>shroud</b> regions [1] as depicted in Fig. 1. Region I (0 ≤rd/R 2 ≤ 0. 4) is the “inner region ” where flow exhibits the solid body rotation (rd: the radial coordinate originating from the spindle exterior, R 2 : the disk radius). Region II (0. 4 ≤rd/R 2 ≤ 0. 75) is the “outer region ” where distinct vortical structure is observed. Region III (0. 75 ≤rd/R 2) is the “shroud region ” where significant turbulent production occurs due to the strong shear at the shroud wall.
