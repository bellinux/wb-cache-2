Thus she, at least, does not, like Homer, in his chivalrous way, throw all the blame on the Immortals and on destiny.

40|$|This paper interprets {{facts about}} actions and {{responsibility}} {{in terms of}} Kant’s category of the ‘intelligible,’ but is also broadly naturalistic in its approach. It analyses intelligible facts in terms of two elements, the institutional and the normative. First, I draw on John Searle’s account of institutional facts. Searle emphasises that neither {{the meaning of a}} word nor my possession of something is a matter of empirical facts concerning the entity itself. Instead, {{to understand the nature of}} such facts, we must take account of people’s shared beliefs. Kant’s account of property relations can, in part, be understood as an institution in Searle’s sense. Drawing on the work of Tamar Schapiro and Arthur Ripstein, I extend this idea to illuminate <b>our</b> ‘ownership’ <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>deeds.</b> Second, and more briefly, I present a normative element. Institutional facts need not, in themselves, be morally compelling. Under conditions of relative freedom and equality, however, I argue that practices of responsibility can be seen as a practical manifestation of critique. This generates a critical self-reflexivity that, I suggest, provides normative warrant to the practices of action and responsibility that we institute among ourselves...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} clarify the {{relationship}} between Nāgārjuna's philosophy of the Middle Way, based {{on the notion of}} emptiness (śūnyatā), and Pure Land Buddhist thought, of which Shinran was a devotee. In Shinran's texts, one can see many references to Nāgārjuna {{as one of the greatest}} teachers of Mahāyāna Buddhism as well as of Pure Land Buddhism. But, it is still open to debate whether he may be considered the real ancestor of Pure Land Buddhism, though Shinran seems to have had no doubt that he was the very man who set the precedent for the teaching of the easy path of nembutsu. As a matter of fact, one can say that Jodo-Shin-Shū has not dwelt a great deal on Nāgārjuna's philosophy of emptiness. One reason may be that, for many people, Nāgārjuna's thoughts on emptiness were too profound to comprehend. Again, some might say there is little relationship to the teachings of the Pure Land, in which various expedients (upāya) are used to guide ordinary people. Nāgārjuna's emptiness is mainly mentioned in Sanskrit texts such as the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (“Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way”). One must carefully reread these texts in order to see how the philosophy of emptiness can be employed in the generation of Pure Land thought. This is as most Buddhists have been reading Nāgārjuna's texts through the classical Chinese translations. In this thesis, two key terms prapañca and prajñapti are carefully examined. Although both are surely related to human conceptual and linguistic practices, they are often considered to be of secondary value, at best, as compared with the notion of emptiness. But, such understanding may not be correct as it is influenced, to some unknown degree, by the style of the individual translator. The word “prajñapti” means practice in this world, of which nature is nothing other than “emptiness” (śūnyatā). Consequently, all <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>deeds</b> are subject to failure. But, once one accepts this uncertainty of emptiness, one will no more be tormented by one's own actions. Meanwhile, Shinran, basing his own faith on Pure Land Buddhism, emphasized the role of expedients, or “means,” and salvation by faith to the Other (Amitābha). This salvation by faith means giving up reliance on one's own ability and accepting the power of “emptiness. ” In this way, one lives in the real world expediently and depending upon linguistic practice...|$|R
