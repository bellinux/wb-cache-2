5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> attached to the arms donâ€™t {{have to be the}} same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> being developed to treat them.|$|E

25|$|Nevirapine is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes.

25|$|Selective ligands have a {{tendency}} to bind to very limited kinds of receptor, whereas non-selective ligands bind to several types of receptors. This {{plays an important role in}} pharmacology, where <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> non-selective tend to have more adverse effects, because they bind to several other receptors in addition to the one generating the desired effect.|$|E
25|$|The two {{extremes}} of this spectrum are the poor metabolizers and ultra-rapid metabolizers. Efficacy of a medication {{is not only}} based on the above metabolic statuses, but also the type of drug consumed. Drugs can be classified into two main groups: active drugs and prodrugs. Active drugs refer to <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> inactivated during metabolism, and prodrugs are inactive until they are metabolized.|$|E

25|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system {{is enhanced by}} concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.|$|E
25|$|As p53 protein {{levels are}} usually kept low, one could block its {{degradation}} and allow {{large amounts of}} p53 to accumulate, thus stimulating p53 activity and its antitumour effects. Drugs that utilize this mechanism include nutlin and MI-219, which are both in phase I clinical trials. There are also other <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> still in the preclinical stage of testing, such as RITA and MITA.|$|E
