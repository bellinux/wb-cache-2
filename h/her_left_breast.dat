5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>breast,</b> one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E

30|$|Cancer antigen 15 - 3 (CA 15 - 3) is {{considered}} as a marker for breast cancer recurrence. However, we encountered {{a case where the}} patient showed postoperative elevation of the CA 15 - 3 level due to pernicious anemia without evidence of breast cancer recurrence. The patient was a 60 -year-old postmenopausal woman. She had undergone partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for <b>her</b> T 1 <b>left</b> <b>breast</b> cancer. SLNB had indicated no lymph node metastases. The tumor was positive for hormone receptors and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Therefore, an aromatase inhibitor and external beam irradiation had been administered as adjuvant therapy. However, the CA 15 - 3 level was found to be elevated at 6  months postoperatively. Although imaging studies did not indicate breast cancer recurrence, CA 15 - 3 levels continued to increase. Based on the findings of blood tests and gastroendoscopy, a diagnosis of pernicious anemia due to vitamin B 12 deficiency was finally confirmed at 2  years and 6  months postoperatively. The CA 15 - 3 level returned to normal after vitamin B 12 administration. The possibility of pernicious anemia should be considered in cases of postoperative elevated CA 15 - 3 levels with no evidence of recurrence in patients with early breast cancer.|$|R
2500|$|The Younger Lady has {{a gaping}} {{wound in the}} left side of her face. Julian Heath {{suggests}} that the wound was likely the result of an axe blow. Below <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>breast</b> there is another gaping wound, likely {{to be the result of}} a stab wound. In 2003, a scientific team from York University, working under Joann Fletcher, examined the mummy. A member of the team realized that the face wound could have been a premortem wound, and not a postmortem wound as previously assumed. Instead of the Younger Lady's remains simply being mutilated after her death by tomb robbers motivated by malice, it seemed likely the Lady had been injured while still alive. The conclusion was considered uncertain. At a later point, Ashraf Selim lend support to this theory. He noted that if the Younger Lady's had been damaged following the embalming process, then bits of dried bone and flesh could be located in the mummy's wounds. Since no such findings occurred, he was certain that this was a premortem wound. Further, Selim viewed the wound as too violent to be the result of an accident. The Lady had been injured in an act of deliberate violence. The Egyptian Mummy Project which used a CT scan to examine the mummy, located [...] "very few pieces of the relevant broken bones" [...] in the sinus cavity. They concluded that the Young Lady's face had been damaged before the embalming process, and likely prior to her death. Indeed, the face wound was determined to be a probable cause of death for the Lady.|$|E

It was the winged figure of a woman of such marvellous loveliness and {{delicacy}} of form that the size seemed rather to add to than to detract from its so human and yet more spiritual beauty. She was bending forward and poising herself upon her half-spread wings as though to preserve her balance as she leant. Her arms were outstretched like those of some woman about to embrace one she dearly loved, while her whole attitude gave an impression of the tenderest beseeching. Her perfect and most gracious form was naked, save--and here came the extraordinary thing--the face, which was thinly veiled, {{so that we could}} only trace the marking of her features.

5000|$|Though Rubens’s {{two works}} are very similar, they do differ. In his first depiction, the brushstrokes are looser, {{it is not}} as detailed, there is less landscape, no {{elaborate}} headpiece, the colors are muted, and the drapes are green. The 1601 painting was initially supposed to be in a painted ellipse that cut off the left elbow and part of the right foot as seen through x-rays. Today it is in a rectangular format along with the 1602 painting. In his second painting, the brushstrokes are more precise, there is more detail, there is a clearer landscape in the background, an elaborate headpiece, more vibrant colors, and the drapery is white and red. A common Renaissance and Baroque theme is females that are abducted or seduced by divinities. [...] This includes Leda and the swan as Zeus, as well as Europa, Antiope, and Danae. Many portrayals of women being seduced by divinities are shown in a sensual manner. For instance, Rubens’s Leda, is very erotic.

The erosion had steadily enlarged and had become increasingly tender. The nipple and areola of the <b>left</b> <b>breast</b> disappeared and could not be recognized. No abnormality of the right nipple, areola, and covering skin and no supernumerary nipple were seen. Mammography and ultrasonography could not be performed because of severe pain and erosive wetness. Histopathology of a surgical biopsy specimen showed epidermal infiltration by large, round, clear atypical cells scattered individually or in small clusters and distributed horizontally throughout the epidermis. The cytoplasm of these large cells was pale and vacuolated and was equivalent to that in nipple cells in Paget,s disease, and a diagnosis of mammary Paget,s disease was made. We performed total mastectomy of the <b>left</b> <b>breast</b> with wide excision of the Paget lesion of the left chest and axillary lymph node sampling. Histological examination of the specimen showed typical distribution of Paget,s cells; however no ductal carcinoma in situ was found in the mammary ducts and invasive growth was not recognized beyond the basal membrane of the lesion.
