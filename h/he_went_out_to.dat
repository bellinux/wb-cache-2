5|$|Miler {{started his}} {{campaign}} for Test selection when the servicemen arrived in Perth and played their first match against Western Australia. Miller put in his best batting performance {{of the season with}} an 80 in a drawn match, before being rested in the match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, which again ended in a draw. Miller finally returned to his home town on 2 January 1946 and was reunited with family and friends before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 as the military men fell to an innings defeat, troubled by the off spin of Ian Johnson. Miller and the servicemen had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. Miller faced his biggest challenge in Australian conditions in his quest for Test selection when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat. The Australian selectors had not been in England for the Victory Tests to witness his ability and Miller had not played to his potential on Australian soil. Local Australian opinion was that because the Services had played poorly in Australia, their achievements in England must have been against poor opposition.|$|E

25|$|After {{acting as}} house physician, house surgeon and {{demonstrator}} of anatomy, and showing {{promise of a}} successful professional career in London, his health broke down from overwork in 1878, and <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> South Africa and settled down in practice at Kimberley. There he rapidly acquired a great reputation as a medical man, and, besides numbering President Kruger and the Matabele chief Lobengula among his patients, came much into contact with Cecil Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Plummer {{left the}} Daily Express {{when he was}} named by John Strachey as chairman-designate of the Overseas Food Corporation {{at the end of}} 1947. However the {{appointment}} was not confirmed until February 1948. The Corporation was created to take charge of the Tanganyika groundnut scheme, a massive project to cultivate peanuts on 325 million acres (1,320,000km²) of scrubland in Tanganyika Territory. The scheme was well advanced by the time Plummer moved in, but he was an enthusiastic supporter. In January 1949 <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> take personal charge of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|Davidson made a {{deal with}} Time-Life, a company that was going into the movie-making {{business}}. However, it quickly left the business after making two films that were not financially successful. He was understandably upset and {{a couple of days later}} <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner and met a secretary who had worked on his first film. He told her what had happened to his film, and she gave his script for Eddie and the Cruisers to her business partners. In a relatively short time, a deal was struck with Aurora and Davidson was given a $6 million budget.|$|E

25|$|A {{very fast}} bowler {{with the ability}} to cause {{problems}} even on docile pitches, Ted McDonald was the unexpected bowling sensation of the 1921 Australian tour to England. He and Jack Gregory caused something approaching panic among the England batsmen: John Evans' knees were allegedly knocking together when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat, and Andy Ducat was bowled when part of his bat, broken by McDonald's pace, hit the wicket. Where Gregory was able to swing the ball both ways, McDonald imparted vicious movement off the wicket. Like later fast bowling pairs, they were devastating in combination, taking 46 wickets in the series.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent some}} time working in Lisbon in the diamond trade, {{according}} to a deposition he made in 1801, before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Bengal in 1759 where he was employed in Calcutta {{as a factor in}} the service of the English East India Company. He learned to speak Bengali, an addition to his other languages, English, Dutch, German, Portuguese and French. Later he was appointed to the Company’s Benares (Varanasi) factory, where he opened a woollens mart, developed saltpetre manufacturing, established opium works, imported cotton, and promoted the trade in diamonds from the Panna and Chudderpoor (Chhatarpur) mines in Bundelkhand.|$|E
25|$|Waugh was booed when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat in {{the first}} innings, and {{apparently}} rattled by the hostile reception, he batted scratchily for 36 minutes before being dismissed for seven. He regarded it as the most difficult day of his career. In the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 51 and was given a standing ovation by {{some parts of the}} crowd in contrast to other hostile sections. He took three catches in England' second innings as Australia won the match to retain the Ashes. Waugh scored 36 and 43 in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, which saw him pass 1,000 Test runs for the calendar year.|$|E

25|$|Born into a naval family, Halsted went to sea at {{an early}} age with his father and at least one of his brothers. After a period of {{schooling}} he rejoined the navy and served aboard a number of ships and under a variety of notable commanders of the age, until reaching the rank of lieutenant shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the East Indies for much of them, serving onshore with troops and later commanding a sloop, before returning to Britain hoping to receive post-rank and the command of a frigate. He was disappointed, the Admiralty declined to confirm his appointment and he spent a number of years without a ship.|$|E
25|$|Though {{promoted}} to post captain, Lushington {{went on to}} spend ten years without a ship. Returning to service in 1839, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the West Indies, but had to return home due to illness. He went on to command more ships in the Mediterranean, and was there when the Crimean War broke out. Operating this time against the Russians and in alliance with the Ottomans, Lushington took command of the naval brigade and won further honours. He was {{promoted to}} flag rank and received honours from the French and Ottomans, {{as well as from}} the British government. He rose to admiral during his last years, served as lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital, and died in 1877 a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath and with a collection of foreign honours.|$|E
25|$|Elliot briefly {{represented}} Roxburghshire in Parliament, {{and served}} as Secretary to the Admiralty and later one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. He briefly returned to active naval service with his elevation to flag rank, and commanded the station at the Cape of Good Hope. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> superintend operations in China during the First Opium War, but failed to make any decisive difference, and returned to Britain. Here he found factional politics had reduced his and his relations' former influence in government, and he thereafter only served in a minor capacity in the navy, and {{did not return to}} government office. He died in 1863, having risen by seniority to the rank of admiral, fathered a large family which included high-ranking military officers, and their spouses, and having made a distinct contribution to naval policy during his time in politics.|$|E

25|$|Heathcote {{then went}} out to the East Indies {{commanding}} a ship of the line. After service transporting the ambassadors to Persia, he was based on the Indian coast. While there he took a bold decision to open despatches and then quit his post to deliver them to the station commanders, who were at the time involved in the Java Expedition. He was court-martialed for this, but though several charges were proved, he was judged to have acted in the service's best interests, and was acquitted. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean late in the Napoleonic Wars, and commanded the inshore squadron during the blockade of Toulon. He led one of the last attacks on the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Action of 5 November 1813, and retired ashore {{after the end of the}} wars. He developed a new technique for hoisting staysails, received further promotions, and a knighthood, while in retirement, before his death in 1851 at the rank of admiral.|$|E
25|$|Alms {{served in}} the navy from an early age, seeing his first actions in the Mediterranean and off the French coast, before {{going out to the}} East Indies. He {{narrowly}} survived a shipwreck that claimed most of his shipmates, and returned to England shortly afterwards, having achieved the rank of lieutenant. He was briefly back in the East Indies for service {{during the early years of}} the Seven Years' War, before going to the West Indies in acting-command of a frigate. After being involved in a number of important actions in the Caribbean, he returned to Britain after the end of the war, and retired ashore. Returning to active service after the outbreak of the American War of Independence, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the East Indies in command of his own ship. He saw action at most of the engagements between Sir Edward Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren, particularly distinguishing himself at the Battle of Providien. He retired ashore after the end of the war, and died in 1791.|$|E
25|$|Mostyn entered {{politics}} in 1747, with his election in July that year as Member of Parliament for the Herefordshire constituency of Weobley. He used {{the position to}} support the government, and held the seat until his death. He was appointed Comptroller of the Navy on 22 March 1749, having to manage the repair of old ships {{and the construction of}} new ones during the peace, when the dockyard workforces were being reduced. He is sometimes credited with the introduction of standardised uniforms for naval officers during his time as Comptroller, though an order in council establishing uniform clothing exists dating from 10 February 1747. Mostyn returned to active service with the outbreak of the French and Indian War, receiving a promotion to rear-admiral on 4 February 1755. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> North America in summer that year as second in command of the fleet under Vice-Admiral Edward Boscawen, and spent 1756 as second in command of the western squadron, serving successively under Edward Hawke, Boscawen, and Sir Charles Knowles.|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} month, the {{production}} began falling behind schedule. Much of the delay {{was due to}} Belushi's partying and carousing.

As a result of his late nights and drug and alcohol use, Belushi would often miss unit calls (the beginning of a production day) or go to his trailer after them and sleep, wasting hours of production time. One night, Aykroyd found him crashing on the sofa of a nearby house, where Belushi had already helped himself to food in the refrigerator.|$|E
500|$|James Walker {{was born}} in 1764, the son of James Walker of Innerdovat, Fife and his wife the novelist, Mary Leslie, the third {{daughter}} of Alexander Melville, 5th Earl of Leven. He entered the navy as a midshipman aboard the 32-gun [...] on 18 December 1776, serving under Captain William Garnier. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica in January 1777, but returned to British waters for service in the North Sea and then the English Channel with Sir Charles Hardy's fleet during the invasion crisis in 1779. While serving in the Channel in 1780, Southampton captured an 18-gun French privateer off Portland, with 80 men aboard her. Walker was sent to assist in removing the prisoners, and after doing so remained on board {{to help with the}} baling and pumping, as the privateer was in danger of sinking. Despite his efforts the privateer suddenly sank, nearly taking Walker down with her. He was in the water for ten minutes before being rescued.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{recorded}} {{that the}} main elements of England's success were [...] "the magnificent batting of A. G. Steel and the bowling of Ulyett". Batting first, Australia were reduced to 160/9 despite an innings of 63 by Giffen; but then Scott and Boyle added 69 for the final wicket, Wisden reporting that Scott played [...] "cool, confident, skilful cricket" [...] in an innings of 75. At close of play on the first day, England were 90/3 so the match was evenly poised, with Lucas on 28 and Shrewsbury on 27. Steel commenced his innings on the second morning and shared successful partnerships with Ulyett, Barlow and Lyttelton. While Steel was in, 261 runs were added and he made 148 including thirteen boundaries. It was the highest score made against the Australians during the season. By close of play, Australia had lost four wickets in their second innings for only 73 runs. Barlow later recorded that the score was 135/5 when <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> join Steel and recalled Lord Harris, the England captain, saying to him: [...] "For Heaven's sake, Barlow, stop this rot!" [...] Barlow and Steel added 98 for the sixth wicket. Despite another good effort by Scott on the final day, Australia failed to avoid the innings defeat. Ulyett bowled very well but may have been helped {{by the state of}} the ground. However, Ulyett is best remembered in this match for taking what Pelham Warner called [...] "one of the historic catches of cricket" [...] when he caught and bowled Bonnor, noted for his powerful hitting. Warner recorded of Steel's innings that George Giffen talked about it most enthusiastically as late as 1911, when the two were in conversation at Adelaide. When Scott was dismissed for 75 in the Australian first innings, he was caught by his own captain Murdoch off the bowling of Steel. Murdoch was on as a substitute for an injured English player and {{this was the first time}} in Test cricket that a batsman was dismissed by a catch taken by a substitute fielder.|$|E
