50|$|Not all <b>futurists</b> {{engage in}} the {{practice}} of futurology as generally defined. Pre-conventional <b>futurists</b> (see below) would generally not. And while religious <b>futurists,</b> astrologers, occultists, New Age divinists, etc. use methodologies that include study, none of their personal revelation or belief-based work would fall within a consensus definition of futurology as used in academics or by futures studies professionals.|$|R
40|$|Responsibility for {{the future}} can be closely linked to {{innovation}} and responsibility of entrepreneurship, nevertheless we are all responsible for our future. Since <b>futurists</b> have a special role in catalysing social changes and channelling actions for better futures, the present study analyses how the responsibility of <b>futurists</b> is seen in our times, characterised by great and far-reaching changes, and how this activity is enriched by elements of foresight. The responsibility of <b>futurists</b> lies in mapping out, communicating and implementing future alternatives. <b>Futurists</b> also have considerable responsibility {{to convince people that}} essential changes have to be accepted by the public...|$|R

5|$|In late September 1910 Bielovucic took Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, {{founder of}} the <b>Futurist</b> movement, over Milan as a {{passenger}} in a Voisin biplane during the International Air Week. Marinetti stated that the experience moved him to his new concept of art.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The <b>Futurist,</b> on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as {{he felt that the}} energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E
5|$|Spiritual Machines is {{the fourth}} studio album by the Canadian {{alternative}} rock band Our Lady Peace, released by Columbia Records in December 2000. Although not initially intended, the project evolved into a conceptual interpretation of <b>futurist</b> and inventor Raymond Kurzweil's 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines. Short tracks of spoken dialog from Kurzweil himself are interspersed among the actual songs on the album. The Kurzweil K250 keyboard, one of his inventions, was utilized throughout the recording of the album.|$|E
30|$|If futures studies aims {{to become}} someday an {{autonomous}} {{field of research}} and application, it must prove that it contributes knowledge, methods, and viewpoints different from those distinctive of other already established fields. A <b>futurist’s</b> toolbox requires both collecting the methods that make <b>futurists</b> different from other academics and practitioners (without implying that <b>futurists</b> must limit themselves to those methods alone) and organizing those methods according to future-based criteria, that is, according to a futures literacy typology.|$|R

5|$|Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian <b>Futurist</b> painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Having {{abandoned}} {{not only}} the concert stage, but also the income that went with it, Ornstein signed an exclusive contract with the Ampico label to make piano rolls. He made over two dozen rolls for Ampico, mostly of a nonmodernist repertoire; the composers he performed most often were Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Two rolls contained his own compositions: Berceuse (Cradle Song) (c. 1920–21) and Prélude tragique (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, even a single example of his <b>futurist</b> pieces which had brought him fame.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. When he left the Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the <b>Futurist</b> movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.|$|E

50|$|Futurism was {{an early}} twentieth-century {{movement}} in Italy that sought to free the country from what the <b>Futurists</b> saw as the dead weight of its classical past. The <b>Futurists</b> were preoccupied with the technology and dynamism of modern life. The movement found its expression primarily in literature and art.|$|R
50|$|The Russian <b>Futurists</b> {{explored}} many of {{the same}} themes as the Italians. Natalia Goncharova's Cyclist (1913) includes some of the same techniques for portraying movement used by Boccioni and the other <b>Futurists,</b> although the work is far more directly representational than Dynamism of a Cyclist and much less ambitious.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, Luigi Russolo, the Italian <b>Futurist</b> {{painter and}} composer, {{wrote of the}} {{possibilities}} of new music in his 1913 manifestoes The Art of Noises and Musica Futurista. He also invented and built instruments such as the intonarumori, mostly percussion, which were used in a precursor to the style known as musique concrète. One {{of the most influential}} events in early 20th century music was the return of Alfredo Casella from France in 1915; Casella founded the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, which promoted several composers in disparate styles, ranging from experimental to traditional. After a dispute over the value of experimental music in 1923, Casella formed the Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche to promote modern experimental music.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s Nevinson {{painted a}} number of cityscapes in London, Paris and New York which were {{generally}} well received. The most notable of these is The Strand by Night from 1937. His post-war work generally included landscapes in a more naturalist style. His large painting of 1932 and 1933, The Twentieth Century used <b>futurist</b> devices to attack Fascism and Nazism. He also produced large historic allegories which were considered inferior to his World War One paintings. Kenneth Clark, then the Director of the National Gallery, made some comments on these lines and, in return, Nevinson became a fierce critic of Clark. Nevinson was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur in 1938 and was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1939.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to London in August 1917, Nevinson first completed six lithographs {{on the subject of}} Building Aircraft for the War Propaganda Bureau portfolio of pictures, Britain's Efforts and Ideals, and then spent seven months in his Hampstead studio working up his sketches from the Front into finished pieces. A number of officials from the Department of Information visited the studio and soon began complaining about these new works. Nevinson was now focused on individuals, either as people displaying heroic qualities or as victims of warfare. He did this by painting in a realistic manner using a limited colour palette, sometimes only mud-brown or khaki. Whereas for his 1916 exhibition Nevinson had displayed both realistic works and pieces using Cubist and <b>Futurist</b> techniques, for his 1918 exhibition all the works were realistic in style and composition.|$|E
5000|$|The Association of Professional <b>Futurists</b> (APF) is a {{community}} of professional <b>futurists,</b> founded in 2002. [...] The APF is similar to other organizations that promote the development of strategic foresight including the World Future Society, the World Futures Studies Federation, the Millennium Project, and the Club of Rome.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} main groups debating {{the fate of}} Soviet art: <b>futurists</b> and traditionalists. Russian <b>Futurists,</b> {{many of whom had}} been {{creating}} abstract or leftist art before the Bolsheviks, believed communism required a complete rupture from the past and, therefore, so did Soviet art. Traditionalists believed in the importance of realistic representations of everyday life. Under Lenin's rule and the New Economic Policy, there was a certain amount of private commercial enterprise, allowing both the <b>futurists</b> and the traditionalists to produce their art for individuals with capital. By 1928, the Soviet government had enough strength and authority to end private enterprises, thus ending support for fringe groups such as the <b>futurists.</b> At this point, although the term [...] "socialist realism" [...] was not being used, its defining characteristics became the norm.|$|R

5|$|Beside {{the many}} authors who were {{attracted}} into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara {{was able to}} influence successive generations of writers. This {{was the case in}} his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by unu magazine, written by Sașa Pană and Moldov, cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and Tudor Arghezi, as well as artists Constantin Brâncuși and Theo van Doesburg. One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was Jacques G. Costin, who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and Futurism, while Ilarie Voronca's Zodiac cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to The Approximate Man. The Kabbalist and Surrealist author Marcel Avramescu, who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art. Other authors from that generation to have been inspired by Tzara were Polish <b>Futurist</b> writer Bruno Jasieński, Japanese poet and Zen thinker Takahashi Shinkichi, and Chilean poet and Dadaist sympathizer Vicente Huidobro, who cited him as a precursor for his own Creacionismo.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson {{had four}} {{pictures}} {{included in the}} Second Exhibition of the London Group held in March 1915. Nevinson's <b>Futurist</b> painting, Returning to the Trenches, and the sculpture The Rock Drill by Jacob Epstein received the most attention and greatest praise in reviews of the show. After his father received assurances {{that he would not}} be posted abroad, Nevinson enlisted as a private in the Royal Army Medical Corps and spent the rest of 1915 working at the Third London General Hospital in Wandsworth. Despite its name, the 3rd LGH was a specialist centre for the treatment of both shell shock and severe facial injuries. Nevinson worked there as an orderly and as a labourer helping build roads and fit out new wards. Sometimes he would be sent to Charing Cross to meet, and unload, the hospital trains arriving from France and for a while he worked on a ward for mental patients. Nevinson married Kathleen Knowlman on 1 November 1915 at Hampstead Town Hall and, after a week-long honeymoon, he reported back to the RAMC but was invalided out of the service in January 1916 with acute rheumatic fever.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Boccioni {{published}} his book, Pittura, scultura futuriste (<b>Futurist</b> Painting and Sculpture), which caused a rift {{between himself and}} some of his <b>Futurist</b> comrades. As a result, perhaps, he abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition of a subject by means of colour. With Horizontal Volumes in 1915 and the Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first <b>Futurist</b> work, The City Rises.|$|E
