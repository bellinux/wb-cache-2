40|$|Abstract: By {{definition}} the desertification {{is due to}} both {{climatic variation}} and human impact. The world sees nowadays an increasing global warming period which in its turn {{has been attributed to}} <b>heliogenic</b> and/or anthropogenic effects. In this paper we report on our first results on a correlation study between Sun activity and the appearance of drought periods in Greece for a period of 145 years (1860 - 2005) based on statistical available data in the literature. A dryness parameter d is defined and its correlation with sunspot number variation data is studied and commented. Also the expected Sun activity maximum of the year 2012 and further NASA forecasts for the coming years {{until the end of the}} 25 th Sun cycle are presented and discussed. We show that the cycles of Nature are the most important but also that the anthropogenic effects could damage the sensitive balance which is the outcome of the interplay between the natural forces and Man, a balance which was kept in the long history of the mankind, but now in the last decades is seriously threatened...|$|E
40|$|A variational {{method for}} calculating the {{critical}} nuclear charge, Zc, {{required for the}} binding of a nucleus to two electrons is reported. The method is very effective and performs well compared to the traditional variational principle for calculating energy. The critical nuclear charge, which corresponds to the minimum charge required for the atomic system {{to have at least}} one bound state, has been calculated for helium-like systems both with infinite and finite nuclear masses. The value of Z_C= 0. 911 028 2 (3) is in very good agreement with recent values in the literature for two-electron atoms with an infinite nuclear mass. When nuclear motion is considered, the value for Zc varies from 0. 911 030 3 (2) for that with a nuclear mass of Ne (the largest <b>heliogenic</b> system considered) to 0. 921 802 4 (4) for a system with the nuclear mass of a positron. In all cases the energy varies smoothly as Z â†’ 0. It is found that for the finite nuclear mass case, in agreement with previous work for the fixed nucleus mass system, the outer electron remains localised near the nucleus at Z = Zc. Additionally, the electron probability distribution is calculated to determine the behaviour of the electrons at low Z...|$|E
