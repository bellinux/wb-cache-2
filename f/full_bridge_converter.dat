40|$|Full bridge dc/de {{converter}} topology is extensively {{applied in}} medium to high power conversion. In a power level up to 3 kW, the <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>converter</b> now employs MOSFET switches. High efficiency, high power density, high reliability and low EMI {{are some of}} the most desirable features in these applications, particularly for computer and telecom systems. To achieve these features, soft switching techniques are normally employed. However, the conventional soft switching <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>converter</b> topologies would either lose the soft switching at some operating conditions, or become rather complex in design and implementation for a few kilo watts applications. This thesis presents and analyzes an improved zero voltage switching dc/dc <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>converter</b> topology. The proposed topology employs asymmetrical auxiliary circuits that consist of only a few passive components. However, the advantage of the proposed topology is significant: it achieves soft switching independent of line and load conditions. Detailed steady state and dynamic analyses are performed to understand the operating principle of the proposed topology and its performance.
