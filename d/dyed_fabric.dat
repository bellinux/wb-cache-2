50|$|<b>Fabric</b> <b>dyeing,</b> {{also known}} as piece <b>dyeing,</b> is <b>dyeing</b> <b>fabric</b> {{after it has been}} constructed. It is {{economical}} and the most common method of <b>dyeing</b> solid colored <b>fabrics.</b> The decision regarding color can be made after the fabric has been manufactured. Thus, it is suitable for quick response orders. Dye penetration may not be good in thicker <b>fabrics,</b> so yarn <b>dyeing</b> is sometimes used to <b>dye</b> thick <b>fabrics</b> in solid colors. Various types of dyeing machines are used for piece dyeing. The selection of the equipment is based on factors such as <b>dye</b> and <b>fabric</b> characteristics, cost, and the intended end use.|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{deodorizing}} function and antibacterial activity of <b>fabrics</b> <b>dyed</b> with gallnut extract, a natural dying aqueous solution was prepared by extraction from gallnut using water at 90 C for 90 min with a fixed liquor ratio of 1 : 10. The colorimetric properties, the deodorization {{performance and the}} antibacterial ability of fabrics (cotton, silk and wool <b>fabrics)</b> <b>dyed</b> with the natural colorant extract solution were evaluated. The main component of the colorant (yellowish color) in the gallnut extract {{was found to be}} gallotannin. The K/S value of the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> increased in the order of cotton< silk <wool. From curve fitting of ultraviolet-visible spectra, the gallnut extract obtained in this study was found to comprise gallotannin (69. 0 %), gallic acid (25. 7 %) and methyl gallate (5. 3 %). The <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed a better deodor-izing function against ammonia, trimethyl amine and acetaldehyde, compared to the control (undyed) <b>fabrics.</b> The <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> showed an excellent antibacterial function (99. 9 % reduction) against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumo-nia. These results highlight the strong potential of the natural <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> as a functional material with both high antibacterial activity and deodorizing function.

50|$|Cross dyeing is “a {{method of}} dyeing blend or {{combination}} fabrics {{to two or}} more shades {{by the use of}} dyes with different affinities for the different fibers”. The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped <b>fabrics.</b> Cross <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> may be mistaken for fiber or yarn dyed materials as the fabric is not a solid color, a characteristic considered typical of piece <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It is not possible to visually differentiate between cross <b>dyed</b> <b>fabrics</b> and those <b>dyed</b> at the fiber or yarn stage. An example is cross dyeing blue worsted wool fabric with polyester pin stripes. When dyed, the wool yarns are dyed blue, whereas the polyester yarns remain white.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{ultrafine}} {{carbon black}} (CB) dispersions to <b>dye</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> back is feasible through an exhaustion procedure. The effects of CB particle size, {{the type of}} dispersants, electrolyte concentration and cationic modification of cotton on the colour yields of CB <b>dyed</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> have been investigated. CB particle size ranging from 130 nm to 200 nm is appropriate to achieve a deep black shade in cotton fabrics. Cationic dispersant improves the K/S values and wash fastness of the CB <b>dyed</b> cotton <b>fabrics.</b> However, caution should be exercised in adding electrolytes to CB dispersions.

50|$|Sodium {{silicate}} {{solution is}} used as a fixative for hand dyeing with reactive dyes that require a high pH to react with the textile fiber. After the dye is applied to a cellulose-based fabric, such as cotton or rayon, or onto silk, it is allowed to dry, after which the sodium silicate is painted on to the <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric,</b> covered with plastic to retain moisture, and left to react for an hour at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Ring dyeing {{is a type}} of dyeing {{fault in}} which dyes are {{partially}} diffused to the interior of fibre. Most dyes are stained on to the fibre surface that form layer of dyes on to fibre surface. Thus around the fibre a ring-like appearance of the dye can be viewed cross-sectionally. This ring-like dye layer opposes further dye diffusion. This problem leads to poor wash fastness and rubbing fastness of <b>dyed</b> <b>fabric,</b> as well as other staining-related fastness properties.|$|E
