40|$|Background - Hand hygiene is {{important}} for interrupting transmission of viruses through hands. Effectiveness of alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> has been shown for bacteria but their effectiveness in reducing transmission of viruses is ambiguous. Aim - To test efficacy of alcohol <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> against human enteric and respiratory viruses and to compare efficacy of an alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and handwashing {{with soap and water}} against norovirus. Methods - Efficacies of a propanol and an ethanol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> against human enteric and respiratory viruses were tested in carrier tests. Efficacy of an alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and handwashing with soap and water against noroviruses GI. 4, GII. 4, and MNV 1 were tested using finger pad tests. Findings - The alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> reduced the infectivity of rotavirus and influenza A virus completely within 30 s whereas poliovirus Sabin 1, adenovirus type 5, parechovirus 1, and MNV 1 infectivity were reduced 3. 0 ± 0. 4 log 10) was significantly higher than treating hands with alcohol (2. 8 ± 1. 5 log 10). Washing with soap and water for 30 s removed genomic copies of MNV 1 (> 5 log 10), noroviruses GI. 4 (> 6 log 10), and GII. 4 (4 log 10) completely from all finger pads. Treating hands with propanol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> showed little or no reduction to complete reduction with mean genomic copy reduction of noroviruses GI. 4, GII. 4, and MNV 1 being > 2. 6, > 3. 3, and > 1. 2 log 10 polymerase chain reaction units respectively. Conclusions - Washing hands with soap and water is better than using alcohol-based hand disinfectants in removing noroviruses from hands.

40|$|Abstract: The primary {{hypothesis}} {{of this study}} was that a lecture on basic hygiene routines could be associated with an increase in the use of disinfectant for hand hygiene. A secondary hypothesis was that the lecture could positively affect the staff’s knowledge of and attitudes toward basic hygiene routines. A quasi-experimental design including one ward of the department of orthopedics in a Swedish university hospital was adopted. During the pre-intervention test period the consumption of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> was measured for 30 days and a questionnaire was distributed to all staff. The hospital hygiene nurse subsequently provided a lecture on basic hygiene routines to all employees on the ward. During the post-intervention test period the <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> consumption was measured for another 30 days, and the questionnaire was distributed once again. A follow-up measurement was performed 9 months after the intervention. After the lecture on hygiene routines, the consumption of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> increased by 93 %. Nine months after the intervention, the consumption was still 21 % higher than before the intervention. The result of the questionnaire showed that the employees considered themselves applying the disinfectant more thoroughly after the intervention. Some employees changed their perspective on basic hygiene routines after the lecture and stopped using watches and private clothes at work. Our findings suggest that a single education session, a hygiene lecture, could be a simple and cost-effective method to increase the use of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant,</b> thereby reducing the number of nosocomial infections on the wards...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} and causes of hand eczema among healthcare workers in Sweden are lacking. Multidrug-resistant bacteria have necessitated improved hand hygiene and preventive measures. This {{has led to an}} increase in the use of disposable rubber gloves and <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> which might influence the risk of hand eczema. Our aims were to identify healthcare workers with hand eczema; to estimate quantitative and qualitative exposure to rubber gloves, <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and other exposures; and to survey constitutional factors. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to all employees at the hospitals in southern Sweden. The results were statistically analysed using χ 2 -tests and binary logistic regression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hand eczema is {{more common}} in {{healthcare}} workers compared to the general population. The hands are subject to changing occupational exposures due to mandatory hygiene regulations for health care workers. OBJECTIVES: To describe the exposure due to hygiene procedures and investigate the associations between occupational hand washing, use of non-sterile gloves, and <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> and self-reported hand eczema. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with an electronic questionnaire distributed to 28 762 hospital employees in southern Sweden. Respondents working as nurses, assistant nurses or physicians constituted the group of healthcare workers analysed. Adjustments were made for gender, age, wet work at home, life-style factors and atopic dermatitis. RESULTS: 12 288 (43 %) responded including 9051 healthcare workers. In this group the 1 -year prevalence of self-reported hand eczema was 21 %. On a daily basis, 30 % reported hand washing with soap > 20 times at work, 45 % used hand disinfectants > 50 times, and 54 % used non-sterile gloves > 2 hours. After adjustment for confounding factors, a dose-dependent association with self-reported hand eczema was found for the daily number of hand washes with soap at work and time working with disposable gloves, but not for alcoholic disinfectant use. Hand washing outside work was not associated with self-reported hand eczema in the adjusted multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found a higher 1 -year prevalence of self-reported hand eczema among Swedish healthcare workers than reported in the general population. Hand washing with soap and use of disposable gloves were associated with the occurrence of self-reported hand eczema in a dose-dependent way.

40|$|Introduction: Good hand hygiene {{practice}} {{is the single}} most important measure to reduce the spread of bacteria and viruses in healthcare. For nurses, this has become more important as the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals is increasingObjective: To identify factors that are important for adherence to hand hygiene among health care workers with patient contact. Method: Systematic literature review. Original articles were searched in PubMed and Cinahl. Results: Factors of importance for compliance was profession, lack of time, knowledge/education, physical work environment, attitudes toward hand hygiene, and dry hands. Conclusion: More education, less workload and more visible placement of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> containers are examples of actions that could lead to the improvement of staff hand hygiene and reduce the incidence of healthcare associated infections. Due to the fact that health care workers around the world have different training and approaches, the result of this study may be difficult to use. To increase adherence to hand hygiene, a similar study limited to a specific country, such as Sweden, would therefore be interesting to carry through.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and compare the degree of selfreporting succession to the basal hygienic routines of emplyees working in municipal old peoples care versus hospital care. It is also to describe the access of material available in prevention of cross infections. The study was also carried out with a comparative and quantitative run up design. The study is based on a questionnaire in the district of Gävleborg in the spring of 2009. Nurses, auxiliaries and carers whom were in close contact with patients were asked to join the study. In total 134 participated, 67 within municipal care and 67 from hospital care. The result showed that there was a lack of compliance of routines in both areas. The most significant difference was to be seen in the compliance of using <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> before close contact with the patients. The result proved also that there was a lack of access to the material needed to obtain a hygienic environment. In further it showed that there was a vast difference in the access to clean working clothes and protective aprons. Employees within the municipal care stated a higher access to these things. There was also a significant difference in the use of protective aprons and gloves, here again employees within the municipal care stated a higher compliance in the use of these.

40|$|After {{accidental}} contamination {{where the}} threat of HIV, HBV, or HCV exists, immediate preventive measures must be taken. Thereafter, the incident must be reported to the appropriate occupational insurance agency. If damaged or inflamed skin is exposed to the contaminant, the potentially infectious material must be removed with a swab soaked in a virucidally efficacious alcohol. Then the skin surface - including the surrounding area - must be wiped or rubbed clean with a second swab soaked with the antiseptic. In puncture or incised wounds, bleeding must first be induced or increased, and immediately thereafter, antiseptic measures performed. Using a vacuum/suction device, the blood flow of the puncture can be improved. If the patient {{is known to be}} HIV positive and the puncture wound is not bleeding, bleeding must be immediately induced by exerting great pressure on the surrounding tissue. After spontaneous or induced hemorrhaging, the puncture or incised wound must be spread and then antiseptically rinsed with a virucidally effective <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> or skin antiseptic for ≥ 1 min.

The use of disinfectants for both surface and hand cleaning {{is an essential}} part of the infection control measures. Objective.  To evaluate the effectiveness of common hospital <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> against MRSA, GISA, and heterogeneous GISA (hGISA). Methods.  For methicillin‐susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA, GISA, and hGISA, the levels of susceptibility to <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and their active ingredients were determined. Suspension tests were performed on commercial handwashing products. Results.  Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2 ‐propanol, chlorhexidine, and hexachlorophene were similar for all phenotypes. The MICs of cetrimide and triclosan were higher for the MRSA, GISA, and hGISA strains than for the MSSA strain. The MICs for the chlorhexidine‐containing agents Hibisol and Hibiscrub (AstraZeneca) and for the propanol‐containing agent Sterillium (Medline) were 1 – 2 ‐fold lower for the MSSA strains than for the MRSA, GISA, and hGISA strains. Suspension tests showed that the GISA and hGISA strains were less susceptible to the triclosan‐containing agent Aquasept (SSL) than were the MRSA and MSSA strains, with resistance increasing with glycopeptide resistance. Products containing Betadine (Purdue) were more effective against the GISA and hGISA strains than against the MRSA and MSSA strains, especially after the strain was exposed to the product for 30 seconds.

This is most evident in context-induced, placebo analgesia, which has recently been shown {{to interact with the}} trait of magical thinking (MT) in adults. In children, placebo analgesia and the possible roles that MT and gender might play as modulators of placebo analgesia have remained unexplored. Using a paradigm in which heat pain stimuli were applied to both forearms, we investigated whether MT and gender can influence the magnitude of placebo analgesia in children. Participants were 49 right-handed children (aged 6 - 9  years) who were randomly assigned-stratified for MT and gender-to either an analgesia-expectation or a control-expectation condition. For both conditions, the placebo was a blue-colored <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant</b> that was applied to the children's forearms. Independent of MT, the placebo treatment significantly increased both heat pain threshold and tolerance. The threshold placebo effect was more pronounced for girls than boys. In addition, independent of the expectation treatment, low-MT boys showed a lower tolerance increase on the left compared to the right side. Finally, MT specifically modulated tolerance on the right forearm side: Low-MT boys showed an increase, whereas high-MT boys showed a decrease in heat pain tolerance. This study documented a substantial expectation-induced placebo analgesia response in children (girls < boys) and demonstrated MT and gender-dependent laterality effects in pain perception.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus' {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the population; this organism causes numerous nosocomial infections leading to complications such as bacteraemia, acute endocarditis and may result in death. This situation remains one of the major challenges facing infection control teams and physicians alike. Nosocomial infections are a problem worldwide with a fifth of nosocomial infections in the UK caused by MRSA. As a consequence the control of MRS A infections are a priority. Effective decontamination procedures are necessary. It is important to clean, disinfect or sterilize medical devices as microorganisms can spread directly or indirectly within healthcare services. Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a long established problem; however, as a result of microbial contamination and infection, this has led to an increased use of disinfectants and antiseptics. Consequently, resistance to some disinfectants has been reported. The efficacies of Virkon, Hycolin and Hibiserub were tested using dilution suspension tests against a range of MRS A and MSSA clinical isolates from Malta and the UK at recommended concentrations, half and double the recommended concentrations. The most efficient disinfectants appeared to be Virkon and Hycolin. However, Hycolin was less effective compared to Virkon, and the least effective disinfectant was Hibiscrub, which produced inadequate inhibition of growth. The second part of the study mimicked surfaces found in the clinical environment; Hibiserub was not used, as it is a <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant.</b> The remaining disinfectants, Virkon and Hycolin were highly effective in inhibiting the growth of the isolates tested.

40|$|Background: Surgical hand rub {{and healthy}} skin are basic {{requirements}} to prevent surgical site infections. Nevertheless, {{there is little}} knowledge about the current practice of skin protection and/or skin care products (SP/SC) using among surgeons {{as well as a}} lack of data pertaining to the influence of SP/SC on the antimicrobial efficacy of surgical hand rub. Methods: A 10  weeks-survey among German surgeons as well as an experimental crossover study involving 26 participants were conducted. The immediate and sustainable efficacy (IE/SE) of surgical hand rub and participants’ hand moisture were measured after an 8 -day usage of SP/SC, as well as the influence on micro-perforations on surgical gloves. Results: The questionnaire was available to 16, 000 German surgeons. Thereof, 1, 771 surgeons accessed the questionnaire, representing a total participation rate of 11 %. As 19 % (n[*]=[*] 338) of questionnaires were incomplete, a total of 1, 433 completed questionnaires were available for further analysis. More than 75 % of the participants stated not to use any SP/SC, yet, almost 50 % suffered from skin irritation or discomfort. Only 5 % used SP/SC {{at the beginning of their}} shift. 10 % refused to use SP/SC because of concerns that SP/SC may reduce the antimicrobial efficacy of surgical hand rub. After usage of SP/SC over 8 -days, skin moisture was significantly higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 001), whereas no significant influence on the antimicrobial efficacy of surgical hand rub was observed (IE: P[*]=[*] 0. 135; SP: P[*]=[*] 0. 681). Micro-perforations were detected in 8 / 52 surgical gloves (15 %), with no statistical significant difference between SP/SC users (n[*]=[*] 2 / 26; 8 %) and non-users (n[*]=[*] 6 / 26; 23 %; P[*]=[*] 0. 249). Conclusions: Following the results of this largest questionnaire base survey among German surgeons on skin care, there is a need to educate and inform surgeons on the correct application and the concept of SP/SC strategies. In the present study, the combination of selected SP/SC products and one alcohol-based hand rub formulation did not show a negative interaction with surgical hand rub or surgical glove perforation.

40|$|Abstract Ethanol {{is widely}} used {{in all kinds of}} {{products}} with direct exposure to the human skin (e. g. medicinal products like <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in occupational settings, cosmetics like hairsprays or mouthwashes, pharmaceutical preparations, and many household products). Contradictory evidence about the safety of such topical applications of the alcohol {{can be found in the}} scientific literature, yet an up-to-date risk assessment of ethanol application on the skin and inside the oral cavity is currently lacking. The first and foremost concerns of topical ethanol applications for public health are its carcinogenic effects, as there is unambiguous evidence for the carcinogenicity of ethanol orally consumed in the form of alcoholic beverages. So far there is a lack of evidence to associate topical ethanol use with an increased risk of skin cancer. Limited and conflicting epidemiological evidence is available on the link between the use of ethanol in the oral cavity in the form of mouthwashes or mouthrinses and oral cancer. Some studies pointed to an increased risk of oral cancer due to locally produced acetaldehyde, operating via a similar mechanism to that found after alcoholic beverage ingestion. In addition, topically applied ethanol acts as a skin penetration enhancer and may facilitate the transdermal absorption of xenobiotics (e. g. carcinogenic contaminants in cosmetic formulations). Ethanol use is associated with skin irritation or contact dermatitis, especially in humans with an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) deficiency. After regular application of ethanol on the skin (e. g. in the form of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants)</b> relatively low but measurable blood concentrations of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde may occur, which are, however, below acute toxic levels. Only in children, especially through lacerated skin, can percutaneous toxicity occur. As there might be industry bias in many studies about the safety of topical ethanol applications, as well as a general lack of scientific research on the long-term effects, there is a requirement for independent studies on this topic. The research focus should be set on the chronic toxic effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde at the point of impact, with special regard to children and individuals with genetic deficiencies in ethanol metabolism. </p...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to expectation, {{the risks}} of {{infection}} are growing rather than declining, even in everyday life. After all, {{who is able to}} make a distinction between cleanliness and hygiene? This situation is further compounded by the growing number of persons who are susceptible to infections. If one wants to combat infectious diseases in an economically feasible and consistent manner, public support must be sought. In turn, the public {{have a right to be}} informed in a proper and responsible manner. The difference between “dirt” and “contamination” must be highlighted once again. To create a forum for everyday hygiene, an international expert working group was set up ([URL] The hallmark of this group is its holistic view of hygiene in the family setting, something that is not true in the case of most public health sectors. Based on the latest study results, the International Forum for Hygiene (IFH) has coined a new motto “Selective Hygiene”, and evaluates the causes of infection so as to be able to react in an appropriate manner. The aim cannot be routine, daily repetitive decontamination of all potentially dangerous microbes that are found in a normal household, but rather selective reaction to important transmission processes, i. e. hands and foodstuffs, kitchen, bathroom and toilet. The motto can be summarized as follows: “Do the right thing at the right time”. This, however, calls for an understanding of the risks and of effective procedures for microbial reduction. Depending on the respective circumstances, hands can be washed with running water or by using a <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectant.</b> Even experts must learn that hygiene in the home must be evaluated differently from that of the hospital setting. The comparatively lower risk is offset by markedly less awareness of the risks involved. These risks can be significantly increased by any members of the household who are ill.

Hand disinfection is acknowledged as key element for infection control, but its effect in open, work place settings is unclear. Methods Our study involved a prospective, controlled, intervention-control group design to assess the epidemiological and economical impact of alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> use at work place. Volunteers in public administrations in the municipality of the city of Greifswald were randomized in two groups. Participants in the intervention group were provided with alcoholic hand disinfection, the control group was unchanged. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and days of work were recorded based on a monthly questionnaire over one year. On the whole, 1230 person months were evaluated. Results Hand disinfection reduced the number of episodes of illness {{for the majority of the}} registered symptoms. This effect became statistically significant for common cold (OR = 0. 35 [0. 17 - 0. 71], p = 0. 003), fever (OR = 0. 38 [0. 14 - 0. 99], p = 0. 035) and coughing (OR = 0. 45 [0. 22 - 0. 91], p = 0. 02). Participants in the intervention group reported less days ill for most symptoms assessed, e. g. colds (2. 07 vs. 2. 78 %, p = 0. 008), fever (0. 25 vs. 0. 31 %, p = 0. 037) and cough (1. 85 vs. 2. 00 %, p = 0. 024). For diarrhoea, the odds ratio for being absent became statistically significant too (0. 11 (CI 0. 01 - 0. 93).

In 1996 Didier Pittet first gave me a demonstration of alcohol-based rub products at his Geneva hospital, and the following year experts at Lausanne University provided me with the products available at that time. In 1998 and 2000 I had the opportunity to exchange information and experiences with numerous European experts, including Dr. Molitor, who also gave me additional insights into the mechanism of action of such products. As a result of myriad scientific demonstrations, interest in these rub products now began to be expressed in the USA too. In 1999 an interdisciplinary working group for hand hygiene was set up, comprising representatives from CDC’s Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, whose intention was to formulate new guidelines for hand hygiene in the healthcare sector. The insights that I gained from Dr. Molitor and from other European experts were of enormous value and helped to weigh up {{the pros and cons of}} alcohol-based hand disinfection, both in respect of the different products available and on comparing them with hand washing. The new CDC guideline for hand hygiene was published in 20002 and for the first time in the USA it featured the requirement that alcohol-based rub products be used as the method of choice provided that the hands were not visibly soiled or contaminated with protein-based material. Unfortunately, we have no reliable data, but it is estimated that today up to 95 % of doctors and nurses in American hospitals preferentially use alcohol-based rub products – thus reflecting a situation that has long been common practice in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Each year almost 15 {{million people}} die of {{infectious}} diseases and in all probability this figure is much higher, because in many cases infection {{is not at all}} recognized as being the cause of death or its contributory role is not known. There is an increase in the risks posed by infections; the belief in the omnipotence of drugs has not stood the test of time; rather, by adopting a counterstance we risk losing all that we accomplished during the last decades. After all, over the past 40 years we witnessed progress in the development of reliable and affordable anti-infectives and vaccines. As a result of this, today parents have their children vaccinated less often since they are no longer aware of the risks posed by lack of vaccination. This will give rise to the sudden reemergence of certain infectious diseases. And we overlook the fact that by observing basic rules of hygiene (hand hygiene; water decontamination; etc), we could save many lives on this earth. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to treat with antibiotics patients harboring resistant bacterial strains on their skin. Hospitals need surface disinfection to prevent microbes such as Clostridiium difficile or norovirus. The institutional use of alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> has by now become an accepted practice in North America. But some of these substances have dangerous side effects where humans and the environment are concerned. Our test methods are not always able to evaluate the actual extent of the risks posed. Prevention is accorded greater importance in view of the declining number of therapeutic measures available. But combating pathogenic microorganisms could, in turn, give rise to problems whose nature we cannot at all predict today. We need far greater knowledge of the pathogens and should be less naïve when embracing new technologies, which only seem to solve problems. What will be the long-term implications if the increasing selective pressure exerted on these bacteria induces them to become more resistant?We need an effective combination of treatment and vaccination strategies, together with a consistent prevention policy. Unlike drugs and vaccinations, disinfectants {{can be used in a}} consistent manner; they can simultaneously eliminate a vast range of pathogenic microorganisms, without having any major side effects...|$|R

40|$|Hand {{dermatitis}} {{is regarded}} as one of the most often observed dermatological disorders among nurses. The factors that increase the risk of developing hand dermatitis are as follows: frequent washing <b>hands,</b> using <b>disinfectants,</b> wetwork conditions, exposure to medical substances, detergents and wearing rubber gloves. Most cases of occupational hand dermatitis is due to chronic exposure to irritants that cause the inflammation on the nonallergic pathway. Recurring contact to irritants disturbes the natural skin barrier and causes inflammation. There are reports showing the presence of skin barrier alterations among nurses working in operating room units. The most common contact allergens in the hospital environment include rubber, latex, medicaments and antiseptic products. In our study the incidence of self-reported hand dermatitis in hospital staff was very high. About 70 % of respondents declared the presence of symptoms of hand eczema within the last 12 months and about 46 % of the studied group had skin lesions at the moment of self-examination. Almost 75 % of employees with hand dermatitis had observed the worsening of skin problems in relation to work and 79 % reported improvement of skin changes during the leisure time. We also noted that a personal or family history of atopy increases the risk of developing hand dermatitis in nurses. We would also like to emphasize the psychological consequencies that affect nurses with hand dermatitis. According to our data 48 % of hospital employees with hand eczema declare psychological distress caused by their skin lesions...|$|R
40|$|Hand hygiene {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} measures to prevent transmission of infectious agents and plays a major role in prevention of infection in any type of healthcare setting. While requirements for the efficacy of <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> are defined in European testing norms such as the EN 1500 for hygienic hand disinfection or EN 12791 for surgical hand preparation, no specific recommendations for hand rub dispensers and liquid soap dispensers have been given yet. Therefore, the intention of the present recommendation on soap and hand rub dispensers in healthcare facilities is to close this gap and to enhance future improvement of dispenser functionality and design. Regardless of manufacture and design of a hand rub or liquid soap dispensers the following requirements shall be met in healthcare facilities: Triggering the dispenser must be possible without using hands. Sensor- or elbow-operated dispensers both fulfill this requirement. Dispensers must be only refillable in a modality where the content, be it a hand rub or liquid soap, cannot be contaminated. This is achieved best by using replaceable cartridge systems. Refilling through “top-up” must not be possible. The disperser should allow usage of different types of cartridges made by different manufacturers. Dispensers must be operated and maintained such that a microbial contamination of the pump nozzle may easily be avoided. It must be possible to identify the products used in a dispenser easily and without any manipulation. Identifying the type of product, be it a hand rub or a liquid soap, as well as reading the product's name and critical manufacturers' warnings must be possible at any time. The disperser must allow identification of the level of the used product without any further manipulation at any time. The design of the dispenser must allow easy cleaning and disinfection the outside and inside of the dispenser. The manufacturer of the dispenser must provide the user with information on applicable chemicals and cleaning products. It must be possible to reprocess the dispenser and all of its permanent parts by applying machine based thermal disinfection at an A 0 -value of minimum 60 (e. g. 80 °C/ 1 minute). Automatically portioning dispensers shall not fail during 200 hubs. The maximal allowed failure rate shall not exceed 1 % (2 out of 200 consecutive hubs). A dispenser used for alcohol based hand rubs must allow keeping the alcohol concentration constant over a time period of 3 months. The maximum acceptable decrease in the concentration of the alcohol shall not exceed 5 %. Liquid soap and hand rub dispensers with single-use pumps, ideally already mounted on the cartridge and to be discharged with the empty cartridge, are preferable. If pumps are used on the next consecutive cartridge, the manufacturer must provide the user with a detailed introduction for cleansing and reprocessing before further use. Because of forensic reasons it is recommended to place a good readable sign on the dispenser indicating e. g. “Apply alcohol based hand rubs only on the hand! Do not drink, avoid spraying into the eye or application on mucous membranes”. It is regarded as an additional benefit, if the dispenser is able to document the consumption of hand rub or the frequency of hubs either mechanically or electronically...|$|R
40|$|Nosocomial {{infection}} {{and the importance}} of its prevention where first recognised by Dr. Ingaz Semmelweis in the 1850 s, who discovered the effect of <b>hand</b> washing and <b>disinfectant.</b> Nowadays, nosocomial infections are a common cause of mortality and morbidity affecting 5 - 10 % of all hospitalised patients. It is further a major economical burden, estimated to cost $ 4, 5 billion per year in the USA. The most common diseases occurring in hospitalised patients are urinary tract infections, pnemonia (VAP and HAP), catheter related bloodstream infections, surgical site infections and gastroenteritis. The most frequent and most important causative agents of these infections are Gram positive (Staphylococci, Enterococci) and Gram negatives (Enterobactericae, Pseudomonas, Actinobacter) bacterie. There are different types of patient affected, but in general do they have one or more risk factors. These risk factors include immunocompromised host, prolonged hospital stay, severe underlying ilness, need for frequent medical intervention, prolonged treatment with antibiotica or the presence of invasive device, catheter or endotracheal tube. Previous antibiotic treatment is also a risk because it impairs normal symbiotic bacterial flora and allowing colonisation with multiresistant strains (MDR). Thus, ICU patient are [...] .

40|$|Intervention {{methods to}} control the {{transmission}} of noroviruses and other enteric and respiratory viruses Era Tuladhar Abstract Human noroviruses are {{the leading cause of}} acute and outbreak associated gastroenteritis worldwide. The outbreaks occur often in hospitals, nursing homes, health care centers as well as in individual homes. Due to the high number of outbreaks and frequency of infection, the burden of disease is high. The virus transmission takes place from person to person directly through the fecal oral route or indirectly through contaminated surfaces or consumption of contaminated food. This study aimed to investigate methods to reduce the burden of disease caused by norovirus and focuses on reducing the transmission through hands and contaminated surfaces. Besides human norovirus, other enteric and respiratory viruses are also transmitted through these routes and were included in the study. Enteric viruses included in the study were human norovirus GI. 4 and GII. 4, poliovirus Sabin 1, rotavirus SA 11, parechovirus 1 and murine norovirus 1 (MNV 1). The respiratory viruses were adenovirus type 5 and influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus. These viruses can contaminate food through food handler-related contamination. Heating and pasteurizing is a commonly used method for inactivation of microorganisms in food. Heating at commonly used temperatures of 56 °C and 73 °C showed that thermo-stability of parechovirus and influenza virus was found to be similar to that of proven foodborne viruses and heating at 73 °C for 3 min is sufficient to reduce the infectivity of the tested viruses > 4 log 10. Not only food, contaminated hands can also transfer viruses to different surfaces, which are then sources of further transmission of the viruses. Cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces are common intervention methods used in health care and kitchen facilities. The enteric and respiratory viruses showed varying susceptibility to cleaning and disinfection procedures applied. Data on infectious doses and transfer efficiencies was used to estimate a target level to which the residual contamination should be reduced and it was found that a single wipe with liquid soap followed by a wipe with 250 ppm free chlorine solution was sufficient to reduce the residual contamination to below the target level for most of the pathogens tested. Spot disinfection by 1000 ppm chlorine solution after wiping with liquid soap was sufficient to reduce the genomic copies of human norovirus GI. 4 and GII. 4 (> 5 log 10 PCRU) completely within 10 min. In addition to manual cleaning and disinfection, non-touch disinfection of contaminated surfaces by vaporized hydrogen peroxide disinfection at 127 ppm for 1 h, as approved disinfection in the Netherlands for hospitals and health care centers, is effective against poliovirus Sabin 1, rotavirus SA 11, adenovirus type 5 and MNV 1 on stainless steel, framing panel (> 4 log 10 infectivity reduction) and gauze (> 2 log 10 infectivity reduction). Beside non-touch disinfection, immobilized biocidals have been tested for disinfection of contaminated surfaces. Immobilized quaternary ammonium compound coatings were virucidal against the influenza virus within 2 min but no virucidal effect against poliovirus was found in 6 h. Thus the coating can be used against the influenza A virus to prevent the transmission through frequently touched sites but not for non-enveloped viruses. Our study demonstrated that a norovirus contaminated hand can transfer the viruses to different surfaces, including food, even after the virus is dried. As an intervention method to prevent the transmission of the virus, washing hands with soap and water (> 5 log 10 PCRU reduction) is better than using alcohol based <b>hand</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in removing noroviruses from hands. This research has delivered new insights in methods to reduce transmission of human norovirus and produced comparative quantitative data on intervention methods to control transmission of other enteric and respiratory viruses. The study has additionally contributed {{to a better understanding of}} human norovirus transmission intervention efficiency. The new insights allow for the development of science based guidelines to control norovirus and other enteric and respiratory viruses in outbreak settings and thus help to reduce the burden of illness caused by these viruses...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{health care}} personnelhandhygieneandwearing {{appropriate}} protective gloves are compulsory. We have noticed {{an increase of}} hand eczema caused by contact allergy from rubber chemicals such as diphenylguanidine (DPG) in synthetic rubber gloves used by surgeons and surgical nurses. The exposure time to surgical gloves {{as well as the}} number of gloves used per day vary. Furthermore surgery very often includes the use of skin disinfectants before glove donning. Objectives: Does the exposure time influence the amount of DPG released from the gloves? Does the exposure of skin disinfectants before glove donning influence the release of DPG? Methods: Using synthetic sweat, the amount of DPG released from the inside of the gloves at different timeswas measured by HPLC. The remaining extractable DPG was estimated by washing the inside of the gloves with ethanol (50 % in water) for 10 min. The amount of DPG found on the hands exposed to 3 ml skin disinfectant allowed to dry prior to glove donning was compared to the amount found on unexposed hands. After wearing gloves for 60 min the handswerewashedwith ethanol and the amount of DPG recovered was analysed with HPLC. Results: After 10, 30, 60 and 180 min approximately 73 %, 79 %, 82 %, 87 % of the total amount of DPG was released. For all comparisons the amount of DPG released was higher on the <b>hand</b> exposed to <b>disinfectants</b> compared with the unexposed hand. Conclusions: A comparatively short exposure time to gloves (10 min) implies a substantial exposure to DPG. Thus, repeated usage of glovesmight enhance skin exposure to this rubber chemical. Skin disinfectants does increase the amount of DPG released from the gloves. Thus, possibly the components of the disinfectant remaining on the skin or some othermechanism add to the exposure to DPG...|$|R
