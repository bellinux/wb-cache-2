5|$|After {{months of}} not {{working on the}} poem, Eliot began to <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> finish it; {{it was not until}} August 1942, however, that he started working on it again. In total, there were five drafts. The poem was {{finished}} by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly. Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series, summarising Eliot's views expressed in this series of poems.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> place a garrison in the city.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

25|$|Since creole {{languages}} rarely attain official status, {{the speakers}} of a fully formed creole may eventually <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> conform their speech {{to one of}} the parent languages. This decreolization process typically brings about a post-creole speech continuum characterized by large-scale variation and hypercorrection in the language.|$|E

25|$|The Medical College Hospital {{board of}} {{trustees}} then met secretly {{with a small group}} of strike leaders to hammer out an agreement. After 99 days of protest, a compromise was reached. Because South Carolina was a right-to-work state, the hospital did not <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> recognize the union. But the administration did rehire the fired workers, created a credit union for hospital employees, and instituted a six-point grievance system.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{correctly}} {{assumed that}} 'Abd-al-Raḥmân would <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> give battle, {{and move on}} and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-al-Raḥmân {{felt he had to}} sack Tours, which meant he had to go through the Frankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles's decision to wait and stay on the hills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad Cavalry to charge uphill and through trees, diminishing their lethality.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E

500|$|The song {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Craig Lytle of Allmusic noted that Houston's voice [...] "sailed" [...] through the song. Christopher John Farley of TIME commented Houston [...] "particularly held her own", with a [...] "masterly balance of pop, zip, and soulful melancholy". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote: [...] "It's lower-key and the singer, who also {{stars in the}} film, doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> perform constant vocal feats." [...] A writer for Boston Herald noted that the song was [...] "understated". Similarly, Larry Flick of Billboard commented that the song should have been released as the follow-up to [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)". [...] "Paired with Babyface, Houston is positively luminous on [...] heartbreak ballad, performing with a perfect blend of theatrical melodrama and guttural soul," [...] he added. [...] Deborah Wilker of South Florida Sun-Sentinel was mixed in her review commenting that the song was a [...] "predictably [...] follow-up" [...] to [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)". But, Nick Krewen of The Spectator was even less enthusiastic, writing [...] " [...] the two guaranteed [...] hits – 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' and 'Why Does It Hurt So Bad' – don't really offer anything new." [...] Similarly, Cary Darling of Rome News-Tribune gave a negative review. She noted that [...] " [...] ballad 'Why Does It Hurt So Bad' is [...] standard Whitney-fare".|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} pilot episode an [...] "Outstanding" [...] rating of 9 out of 10, with Dan Iverson {{starting}} his review by saying [...] "Every [...] a show will come along {{that will be}} so creepy and so intriguing that you <b>feel</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> watch. Dexter {{is one of those}} shows. [...] " [...] and summarized with [...] "The pilot episode did an extremely good job hooking us into the world of Dexter. We are meant to feel confused by his actions, and only time will tell how the show deals with this topic - will Dexter ever go too far, making us turn on our protagonist? There are so many questions that we have about this show, and that is a good thing. Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter. With the solid introduction to the series, characters, and future storylines, we can't help but recommend Dexter to anybody that is at all curious about the show. [...] " [...] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler later placed Mike Donovan third on a list of [...] "Dexter's Top 10 Kills", saying [...] "We all remember our first. First car. First love. First staph infection. And when it comes to Dexter, first kill. No Mike Donovan, the church choir master, wasn't Dexter first dead body, but he was our televisual introduction into Dexter's wicked world of revenge and reckoning." [...] IGN also declared the show as the [...] "Best New Psycho Drama of 2006".|$|E
