40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is a {{major cause}} of {{bacterial}} food-borne infection in the industrial world. There is evidence that C. jejuni is present in eggs and hatchery fluff, opening the possibility for vertical transmission from hens to progeny. Poultry operations in Iceland provide an excellent opportunity to study this possibility, since breeding flocks are established solely from eggs imported from grandparent flocks in Sweden. This leaves limited opportunity for grandparents and their progeny to share isolates through horizontal transmission. While Campylobacter was not detected in all grandparent flocks, 13 of the 16 egg import lots consisted of eggs gathered from one or more Campylobacter-positive grandparent flocks. No evidence of Campylobacter was found by PCR in any of the 10 relevant quarantine hatchery fluff samples examined, and no Campylobacter was isolated from the parent birds through 8 weeks, while they were still in quarantine rearing facilities. After the birds were moved to less biosecure rearing facilities, Campylobacter was isolated, and 29 alleles were observed among the 224 isolates studied. While three alleles were found in both Sweden and Iceland, in no case was the same allele found both in a particular <b>grandparent</b> <b>flock</b> and in its progeny. We could find no evidence for vertical transmission of Campylobacter to the approximately 60, 000 progeny parent breeders that were hatched from eggs coming from Campylobacter-positive grandparent flocks. If vertical transmission is occurring, it is not a significant source for the contamination of chicken flocks with Campylobacter spp...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Recent trends {{occurring}} in broiler primary breeding companies are described. The {{structure and operation}} of broiler primary breeder companies are described from pedigree elite populations, through great-grandparent and grandparent generations, down to the parent stock. The relatively low value of fertility and hatchability, compared with yield and feed efficiency as selection traits, is assessed. The impact of the last 10 yr of genetic improvement in broiler and breeder traits are quantified and discussed, and predictions for future performance are made. It is concluded that artificial insemination will {{not be used in}} broiler primary breeder <b>grandparent</b> <b>flocks</b> or broiler breeder flocks until there is a 20 % decline in fertility.

40|$|In {{the present}} study four meat type <b>grandparent</b> breeder <b>flocks</b> located in Germany were tested {{in the course of}} a {{follow-up}} study to investigate the occurrence of Avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) humoral antibodies by using a commercial ELISA Test and to check the occurrence of aMPV specific RNA of the subtype A and B by using RT-PCR. Samples were taken every three weeks starting on the first day of life. The four meat type <b>grandparent</b> breeder <b>flocks</b> were vaccinated with a combined vaccination program against aMPV. The vaccination program consisted firstly of two vaccinations with a live vaccine given at 8 and 14 weeks of age and secondly was followed by a vaccination with an inactivated vaccine at 18 weeks of age. Four different vaccine combinations regarding the different aMPV-subtypes A and B were used in the four flocks (BBB, BBA, AAA, AAB). In addition, information about flock health and production parameters (egg production, total losses hens) were collected from each flock during the whole production cycle. The aim of {{the present study}} was to investigate the efficacy and efficiency of a combined vaccination program in a large follow-up investigation under field conditions in meat type <b>grandparent</b> breeder <b>flocks.</b> Despite vaccination, it was possible to detect aMPV field infections during the production cycle in all flocks using both method RT-PCR or ELISA. In total, the infection rate was rather low during the production cycle (flock BBB one infection, flock BBA two infections, flock AAA three infections, flock AAB two infections). All detected infections did not lead to any clinical signs typically for the Swollen Head Syndrome. In addition, no mild respiratory signs were recognized in the flocks. Furthermore, none of the flocks showed any changes concerning egg shell quality. Only in one of eight proven aMPV infections during the production cycle it was possible to see a temporal relation between aMPV infection and a drop in egg production. In this specific case, a drop in egg production of 7 % from week 49 to week 51 was followed by a serological proven infection in week 54 in flock BBB (house 2). On the basis of the data collected in this study it can be concluded that two live vaccinations followed by one inactivated vaccination are not able to avoid aMPV infection of the vaccinated flocks. However, the subsequent infections did not induce any typical clinical signs characteristic for the SHS. In seven of eight proven infections, the infection did not have any effect on the flock performance (drop in egg production, rise of total losses of the hens). Consequently, economic damage could be avoided. According to this, a combined vaccination program is advisable for meat type <b>grandparent</b> breeder <b>flocks</b> which are kept under strict biosecurity measures. The data in the present study does not indicate any differences between the four different combined vaccination programs (BBB, BBA, AAA, AAB) regarding their ability to protect against clinical symptoms or to protect against bad flock performance in case of a homologe or heterologe aMPV field infection. On the basis of the current data, it is not necessary to vaccinate the flocks earlier than at week eight of age because there was no aMPV infection detected before this age. Surprisingly, flock AAB showed a delayed and general lower humoral immune response after the live vaccinations in the rearing period than the other flocks BBB, BBA and AAA. Concerning different reasons for this, a variety of aspects like the choice of the ELISA Testkit, the influence of other infectious diseases with an immunosuppressive outcome and spray vaccination failures are discussed in the present study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract. 1. Field {{data on the}} {{reproductive}} performance of parent stock and grandparent female line and male line broiler breeders were extracted from a commercial database covering the years of hatch from 1989 to 2002. The data were from the UK, Western Europe, Central and South America and Japan. Quadratic regression curves were fitted to the data to estimate the long term phenotypic trends in total egg production, hatching egg production, chick numbers, hatchability and female mortality. 2. Changes in performance over time were similar in the UK, Western Europe and Central and South America and {{are consistent with the}} suggestion that genetic selection in separate breeding programmes in the UK (supplying the UK and Western Europe) and Brazil (serving Central and South America) was associated with similar improvements in the performance of commercial parent stock and <b>grandparent</b> <b>flocks.</b> Changes in performance in Japan (supplied from the UK) were different but recent performance was similar to those in the other regions. 3. The mean annual improvement over 10 years to 2002 for male line, female line and parent stock respectively were 0. 4, 1. 7 and 1. 7 for total egg number; 0. 5, 1. 8 and 1. 6 for hatching egg number; 0. 6, 1. 8 and 1. 3 for total chick production; 0. 25, 0. 47 and 0. 09 % for hatchability; and - 0. 69, - 0. 05 and - 0. 41 % for female mortality. 4. The results are consistent with claims that significant genetic change in pedigree selection (nucleus) flocks by the primary breeding company are reflected in substantial improvements in reproductive performance in commercial flocks. The presence of similar rates of improvement in different geographical regions as a result of genetic selection in two continents representing tropical and temperate regions suggests that genotype-environment interactions for reproduction traits are not important...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo genetically {{different}} isolates {{of chicken}} astrovirus (CAstV), named CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672, which share {{low levels of}} antigenic relatedness in cross-indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) tests, have been identified recently. In this study, separate IIF tests for detecting antibodies to the CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672 isolates {{have been used to}} determine the seroprevalences of CAstV infections in 4 generations of flocks involved in broiler chicken production. CAstV antibodies were detected in 78 % (73 % CAstV 612; 46 % CAstV 11672) of serum samples from UK broiler flocks and in all 10 flocks tested, indicating that infections were very common. Twenty three (96 %) of 24 and 26 (93 %) of 28 broiler parent flocks, aged 23 - 26 weeks from 3 UK organisations, were positive for antibody to CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672 respectively. Of 718 samples tested from these parent flocks, 415 (53 %) were positive for either CAstV 612 or CAstV 11672 antibody. CAstV infections were also widespread in parent flocks, with screening of pooled serum samples showing that antibodies to both CAstVs were detected in flocks from 7 other UK poultry organisations and in flocks from 8 other European countries. The seropositivities for CAstVs were substantially less in grandparent (28 %) and great <b>grandparent</b> (21 %) <b>flocks.</b> Overall, higher seropositivies were observed for CAstV 612 than for CAstV 11672 in broiler, parent, GP and GGP flocks. A limited study of 99 sera from 10 turkey breeder flocks showed low level seropositivities for CAstV 612 (9 %) and CAstV 11672 (2 %), indicating that turkeys were infected with CAstVs or antigenically related viruses...|$|R
40|$|Although {{symmetrical}} polyarticular amyloidosis {{has been}} described extensively in brown layers, spontaneous unilateral amyloid arthropathy has not been described previously in chickens. Birds from nine flocks of broiler parent stock (PS) had unilateral lameness associated with severe swelling of the left hock joint and the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. Gross pathology was restricted to the left hock joint and the left digital flexor tendons in almost all cases, suggesting an association with administration of Marek's disease vaccine. Amyloid deposits were found in 83 % (25 / 30) of affected joints by histological examination of Congo red stained sections. Systemic amyloidosis, involving mainly the liver and spleen, was found in 59 % (10 / 17) of birds. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from joints in 77 % (23 / 30) of cases and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the joint in one case (1 / 30). Thirty-five E. faecalis isolates from joints, tendons and blood samples from birds in five affected PS flocks were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to separate genomic fragments after digestion with Sma I. All but one isolate had identical or closely related restriction endonuclease digestion (RED) patterns that were very similar to a known arthropathic and amyloidogenic E. faecalis isolate. A further 30 E. faecalis isolates from seven <b>grandparent</b> stock (GPS) <b>flocks</b> and two isolates from two unaffected PS flocks of the same genetic background were analysed by PFGE. Among these isolates, 11 originating from four GPS flocks had RED patterns identical to or {{closely related to the}} reference amyloid-inducing strain. Moreover, one E. faecalis isolate from amyloidotic joints of brown layers housed in California, USA was included in the analysis and appeared to be identical to the reference strain. This study showed that the E. faecalis isolates involved in these outbreaks of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders belonged to the same clone as that responsible for outbreaks in brown layers...|$|R
40|$|A {{bayesian}} {{primary production}} chain model of salmonella in broiler production {{was developed in}} 2001 for a Quantitative Risk Assessment [1], QRA. This original discrete time Markov chain model over three generations of <b>flocks</b> (<b>grandparent,</b> parent, and production flocks) was based on data provided by the Finnish Salmonella Control Programme, FSCP. The discrete time stochastic model described the status (true infection state) of each flock at regular time intervals corresponding to the testing times of the FSCP. Although detailed flock specific data were not available, {{it was possible to}} use summary data together with auxiliary information about the testing times (ages), number of flock holdings, and the fact that with breeding flocks a positive test result leads to destruction of the flock. Also, informative priors on parameters such as test sensitivity had to be used in a fully Bayesian approach. Based on all available information it was possible to construct a data set in a more detailed manner, regarding life histories, than with the summary data alone. Otherwise, as such, the summary data {{would be very difficult to}} use towards estimation of meaningful epidemiological quantities. The model structures closely corresponded to the structure of the production chain, combining models of horizontal infection and vertical infection between flock generations. This leads to a fairly complicated hierarchical Bayesian model with latent variables, accounting for imperfect testing (sensitivity< 100 %). However, if the number of flocks and/or the number of testing times increase or become irregular, it becomes tedious to accommodate the model to each new situation and it also seriously slows down the computation. Therefore, a continuous time two-state Markov process model was developed for (1) accommodating irregular testing times and hopefully (2) reducing the computing time required. This new model could therefore be more easily applied to different data sets from similar production systems. However, the infection probabilities at testing times require solving a recursive formula which is needed for the likelihood expression as well as in the formulation of vertical transmission probability. Data from Swedish Salmonella Control Programme, SSCP, were used to calculate prevalence estimates for Swedish broiler production chain, based on data from 2007 concerning three generations of flocks: grandparents, parents, and production flocks. Also FSCP data will be analysed. The same model structures apply to egg production chain as well, and could even be applied to other production chains with similar structures. Some results and challenges in Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment, QMRA, are discussed. The model is implemented in OpenBUGS. [1] Ranta J., Maijala R.
