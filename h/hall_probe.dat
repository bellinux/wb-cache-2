Unlike the magnetic force microscope the SHPM provides direct quantitative information on the magnetic state of a material.

5000|$|When the <b>Hall</b> <b>probe</b> is held so {{that the}} {{magnetic}} field lines are passing at right angles through the sensor of the probe, the meter gives {{a reading of the}} value of magnetic flux density (B). A current is passed through the crystal which, when placed in a magnetic field has a [...] "Hall effect" [...] voltage developed across it. The Hall effect is seen when a conductor is passed through a uniform magnetic field. The natural electron drift of the charge carriers causes the magnetic field to apply a Lorentz force (the force exerted on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field) to these charge carriers. The result is what is seen as a charge separation, with a buildup of either positive or negative charges on the bottom or {{on the top of the}} plate. The crystal measures 5 mm square. The probe handle, being made of a non-ferrous material, has no disturbing effect on the field.|$|E

40|$|Manufacture of superconducting rotating-gantry for heavy-ion {{radiotherapy}} {{is currently}} in progress. This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/nucleon to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0 - 360 degrees, and enables advanced radiation-therapy. To reduce the size and weight of the rotating gantry, we designed superconducting magnets that can independently excite dipole and quadrupole field. The three-dimensional scanning-irradiation method is performed in this rotating gantry. Therefore, uniformity of magnetic field is quite important, since scanned beams traverse through these superconducting magnets before reaching to the isocenter. In the present work, we precisely measured the magnetic-field distributions of the superconducting magnets for the rotating gantry. We used <b>Hall</b> <b>probes</b> to measure the magnetic-flux density. The magnetic-field distributions were determined by measuring Hall voltage, while moving the <b>Hall</b> <b>probes</b> on a rail, which has the same curvature as a center trajectory of beams.
