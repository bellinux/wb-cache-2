40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the first year}} of a 3 -year PVMaT Phase 5 A 2 program. Evergreen Solar will soon be expanding into a multi-megawatt facility and the PVMaT work will be used to further the objective of a high-throughput automated production line in every aspect of PV module making from producing silicon ribbon to making a finished module. The project has four task areas for this first year: crystal growth; cell manufacturing; modules; and factory layout and automation. The vast majority of the work this first year has been in the crystal growth and cell manufacturing areas. Evergreen Solar has its own unique technology in each of these areas. In crystal growth, a key goal of this PVMaT project has been developing and deploying an improved string material. The high-temperature string materials are used to stabilize the edges of the growing silicon ribbon in the String Ribbon silicon sheet growth. The result {{has been one of the}} major successes of this first year. Significant cost reductions and yield improvements have emerged from this improved string material. In addition, some of the groundwork for automation of the String Ribbon crystal growth process has been laid and shows much promise. A method for controlling the edge meniscus height was developed, and a patent has been filed based on this discovery. In the cell manufacturing area, the focus has been on reducing the number of processing steps and on design and construction of high-speed processing equipment. The possibility of eliminating all pre-diffusion etching and going directly from growth to diffusion has been demonstrated on an R and D scale. Unique designs for <b>high-speed</b> <b>drying</b> equipment and for a high-speed contact and AR-coating application machine have been developed. In the latter case, the basic concepts underlying various aspects of the machine design have been successfully tested for viability. The integration of the different components of this machine into a smoothly working whole is now well under way. In addition, nonvacuum methods of hydrogen passivation have been investigated, but no production-viable process has emerged from this work. In the module area, initial work has shown that the unique properties of the backskin developed under Evergreen's earlier PVMaT Phase 4 A 1 contract can be expected to make the lay-up process simpler and involve less labor. For factory layout and automation, the authors have enlisted the Fraunhofer Manufacturing Institute at Boston University to aid them with the layout and process flow of their new factory. In general, the project is on schedule, with no significant technical barriers to reach their ultimate objectives...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Heat {{produced}} by friction influences tribological properties greatly, especially under <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> sliding, where {{the temperature is}} high enough to cause obvious changes in the microstructure of the materials. Based on the above suggestions, researches were carried out on several metallic pairs with different thermal properties. The experiments were carried out under the condition of sliding speed ranging from 30 to 60 m/s, contacting pressure ranging from 0. 13 to 1. 33 MPa, and the surrounding temperatures ranging from room temperature to 500 ◦C. The testing results have indicated that thermal behaviours influence tribological characteristics in a very complicatedway. It seems that tribological properties behaviours are different among differ-ent metallic pairs under <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> sliding, {{which seems to be}} related to heat conductivity; tribological properties are also sensitive to surface temperature. All measures to improve the fric-tion heat conduction help to increase the tribological properties. Surrounding temperature also influences the tribological property greatly; it seems that the existence of oxygen is beneficial to obtain better tribological properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Magnesium (Mg) {{components}} {{can significantly}} reduce energy use {{due to their}} low densities compared to the majority alloys. Mg alloys are often machined to fit individual cases. However, process mechanics by <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> cutting of Mg alloys are poorly understood. This study focuses on machining ability of biomedical magnesium-calcium (Mg-Ca) alloys. First, it presents a modeling approach of mechanical behavior of Mg-Ca 0. 8 (wt %) alloy under cutting regimes using the internal state variable (ISV) plasticity model. Then, the ISV plasticity model is implemented to simulate high speed dry cutting of Mg-Ca 0. 8 alloy by finite element method. Last, machining performance {{in the context of}} sustainability is discussed. Excellent surface finish can be achieved in the range of high cutting speeds. Continuous chip formation predicted by the finite element simulation is verified by high speed dry cutting of Mg-Ca 0. 8 using polycrystalline diamond (PCD) inserts. Chip ignition as the most hazardous aspect in machining Mg alloys does not occur for in <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> cutting with sharp PCD tools. The predicted temperature distribution well explains the reason for the absence of chip ignition in high speed dry cutting of Mg-Ca 0. 8 alloy. A mechanism of built-up layer (BUL) formation is proposed. Introduction to Cutting of Mg Alloy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA dry coating {{technique}} {{has been used}} to change the surface properties of silica gel particles (d 50 = 55 μm) by coating with different mass ratios of magnesium stearate - MgSt 2 (d 50 = 4. 6 μm) : 1 %, 5 %, 15 % and 30 %. The dry coating experiments were performed using a “Hybridizer, a <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> impact blending coater”, manufactured by Nara Machinery (Japan). The surface morphology of the uncoated and coated silica gel particles was observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The images show that a greater MgSt 2 coverage was observed on the surface of silica gel as the MgSt 2 mass ratio is increased. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed how this coating process makes possible a discrete and uniform dispersion of the MgSt 2 particles. AFM studies were carried out with a scanning probe microscope Multimode Nanoscope IIIA (Digital Instruments /Veeco Metrology Group) ...|$|R
5000|$|Applications of DLC {{typically}} {{utilize the}} ability of the material to reduce abrasive wear. Tooling components, such as endmills, drill bits, dies and molds often use DLC in this manner. DLC is also used in the engines of modern supersport motorcycles, Formula 1 racecars, NASCAR vehicles, and as a coating on hard-disk platters and hard-disk read heads to protect against head crashes. Virtually all of the multi-bladed razors used for wet shaving have the edges coated with hydrogen-free DLC to reduce friction, preventing abrasion of sensitive skin. It is also being used as a coating by some weapon manufacturers/custom gunsmiths. Some forms have been certified in the EU for food service and find extensive uses in the high-speed actions involved in processing novelty foods such as [...] "chips" [...] and in guiding material flows in packaging foodstuffs with plastic wraps. DLC coats the cutting edges of tools for the <b>high-speed,</b> <b>dry</b> shaping of difficult exposed surfaces of wood and aluminium, for example on automobile dashboards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation conducted on a vertical machining centre (VMC) to ascertain the effectiveness of TiAlN/AlCrN multilayer coated carbide inserts in end milling of AISI D 2 hardened steel (58 - 62 HRC) In <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> hard milling, different cutting speed (v) and radial depth of cut (dr) were applied. Tool failure modes and wear mechanisms were examined at various cutting parameters. Flank wear, chipping and breakage at cutting edge were found to be the predominant tool failure for the cutting tools. Built-up edge, adhesion and abrasive are the wear mechanisms observed on the cutting tools. The highest volume of material removed, VMR attained was 1500 mm 3, meanwhile the highest tool life (T) was 4. 97 min. The surface roughness, Ra values from 0. 20 to 0. 45 µm can be attained in the workpiece with a high volume material removed. The relationship of tool wear performance and surface integrity was established to lead an optimum parameter in order to have high volume material removed, maximum tool life as well as acceptable surface finish...|$|R
40|$|PVD {{titanium}} {{aluminium nitride}} coatings {{are known to}} improve the performance of cutting tools in aggressive machining applications, such as <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> machining. This is generally acknowledged {{to be due to}} the fact that these coatings are able to maintain high hardness and resistance to oxidation at the elevated temperatures typically experienced in such metal cutting applications. In this investigation, the performance of single layer coatings of TiN and CrN, and double layer coatings of TiNy TiAlN and CrNyTiAlN were assessed on Co-HSS drills used to machine grey cast iron. It was found that the CrN coatings performed as well as the TiN coatings when drilling grey cast iron. In addition, the double layer coatings outperformed the single layer coatings with the CrNyTiAlN coatings having a 20 % improvement in tool life compared with the TiNyTiAlN-coated drills. This result is particularly interesting since the Daimler–Benz indentation test suggested that the TiNyTiAlN had much lower adhesion than the CrNyTiAlN. These results are discussed in terms of an analysis of the physical and mechanical properties of the coatings but it highlights the need for meaningful measurement of critical coating properties which might relate to their performance in metal cutting...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{integrity}} {{is a key}} property in the functional performance of machined parts and assembled engineering components. In this study, the effects of cutting conditions and tool wear on the surface integrity of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy after <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> end milling were investigated. Different cutting speeds (100 – 300 m/min) and feeds (0. 03 and 0. 06 mm/tooth) as well as TiAlN + TiN physical vapor deposition (PVD) -coated carbide tool were employed during the machining trials. Surface roughness value and sub-surface microhardness of the machined surfaces were measured, and the corresponding alterations beneath the surface were characterized through electron microscopy. Results showed that surface roughness values at different cutting speeds directly depends on the tool conditions. The use of a new tool contributed to a higher surface quality of 185 nm compared to 320 nm for the used tool at the highest investigated cutting speed. It was found that operating the end milling with the new tool at a higher feed rate significantly decreased the surface roughness of the machined surface from 415 to 225 nm at a lower cutting speed. Feed marks and material redeposition defects were detected on the surface, while plastic deformation was observed in the sub-surface of the machined surface. Microhardness measurement revealed that no significant alterations occurred at the sub-surface when lower cutting speed and feed were employed. Higher cutting speed and feed rate enhanced the sub-surface alteration and resulted in considerable plastic deformation. Microscopic observations further highlighted this behavior...|$|R

The tools were coated in an industrial sputtering machine of the Hauzer HTC 625 type. The new nanocomposite coatings showed a good performance in the dry cutting operations and were benchmarked versus industrial state-of-the-art coatings...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cutting tool materials and PVD surface coatings are making <b>high-speed</b> <b>dry</b> machining an increasingly viable machining operation in commercial manufacturing sectors. High oxidation resistant coatings, such as TiAlN, are used extensively in global manufacturing for reducing production costs and improving productivity in such aggressive metal-cutting operations. In this investigation, {{the performance of}} TiN, Ti 1 -xAlxN and Ti 1 -x-yAlxCryN coatings was assessed on Co-HSS twist drills used to machine an automotive grade grey cast iron. As part of the study, two experimental methods were used to characterise {{the performance of the}} twist drills, namely, by an audible 'screech' and measurement of the progression of outer corner flank wear lands. Both techniques showed that a single layer TiN coating failed to outperform even uncoated twist drills when dry machining grey cast iron under aggressive machining conditions. However, using the measurement of outer corner flank wear technique, the average tool life of uncoated twist drills was increased by factors of 4. 5, 6. 5 and 6. 9 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. In the case of 'screech' failure, the average tool life of uncoated twist drills was increased by factors of 3. 9, 7. 3 and 10. 8 by Ti 0. 59 Al 0. 41 N, Ti 0. 27 Al 0. 19 Cr 0. 54 N and Ti 0. 21 Al 0. 14 Cr 0. 65 N coatings, respectively. The performance of twist drills was also assessed using a number of quantitative techniques, namely, measurement of thrust and torque, hole diameter and drill wear. The latter was also observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed an early onset of workpiece material transfer at the margins of the uncoated drills. In the case of the PVD coated drills, an improvement in the tribological interaction between the coatings and the grey cast iron workpiece resulted in a significant reduction in material transfer at the drill margins. The above results are discussed in terms of their affect on hole diameter and cutting forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of a <b>high-speed</b> motor, <b>dry</b> gas seals, and magnetic bearings realized in this unit facilitates the elimination of oil. The motor is coupled with a quill shaft to the compressor. This yields higher natural frequencies of the rotor than {{with the use of}} a diaphragm coupling and helps to maintain a sufficient margin of the maximum speed to the frequency of the second compressor bending mode. However, the controller of each bearing then has to take the combined modes of both machines into account. The requirements for the controller to ensure stability and sufficient damping of all critical speeds are designed and compared with the implemented controller. The calculated closed loop behavior was confirmed experimentally, except the stability of some higher modes due to slight frequency deviations of the rotor model to the actual rotor. The influence of a mechanical damper as a device to provide additional damping to high models is demonstrated theoretically. After all, it was not necessary to install the damper, since all modes cold be stabilized by the controller...|$|R
40|$|Self-organization during {{friction}} {{in complex}} surface engineered tribosystems is investigated. The probability of self-organization in these complex tribosystems is studied {{on the basis}} of the theoretical concepts of irreversible thermodynamics. It is shown that a higher number of interrelated processes within the system result in an increased probability of self-organization. The results of this thermodynamic model are confirmed by the investigation of the wear performance of a novel Ti 0. 2 Al 0. 55 Cr 0. 2 Si 0. 03 Y 0. 02 N/Ti 0. 25 Al 0. 65 Cr 0. 1 N (PVD) coating with complex nano-multilayered structure under extreme tribological conditions of <b>dry</b> <b>high-speed</b> end milling of hardened H 13 tool steel...|$|R

In milling the Al 7010 -T 7651 alloy, TiAlN/VN and DLC coated tools showed comparable performance, outperforming TiAlCrYN coated and uncoated tools by a factor of 2. 3 and 3. 5, respectively. In the case of milling AlSi 9 Cu 1, the DLC coatings failed to produce any lifetime improvement, TiAlCrYN showed 65 % longer lifetime thus rendering TiAlN/VN as the best performing coating with 100 % longer lifetime compared to that of the uncoated tools. The tests further showed that TiAlN/VN reduces the cutting forces and improves the surface finish.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of self-lubricant hard coatings applied in tools for <b>high-speed</b> cutting or <b>dry</b> drilling operations occurs {{by a combination}} of wear, oxidation and diffusion. The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of V additions on the diffusion processes and on the oxide scale formation during annealing of TiSiVN coatings. Relation of these results with those achieved for a reference Ti 0. 80 Si 0. 15 N coating with similar Si content is also presented. The structure evolution of the Ti 0. 65 Si 0. 11 V 0. 15 N film was assessed by an in-situ hot-XRD device. A dual layer oxide was formed in the case of Ti 0. 80 Si 0. 15 N coating with a protective Si–O layer at an oxide/coating interface; however, in zones of film defects a complex oxide structure was developed.

In the case of milling AlSi 9 Cu 1, the DLC coatings failed to produce any lifetime improvement, TiAlCrYN showed similar to 65 % longer lifetime thus rendering TiAlN/VN as the best performing coating with 100 % longer lifetime compared to that of the uncoated tools. The tests further showed that TiAlN/VN reduces the cutting forces and improves the surface finish. Scanning electron microscopy of the cutting edge carried out after the cutting tests showed that the TiAlN/VN coating significantly reduces metal transfer and built-up edge formation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substrate}} surface treatment (substrate sputter cleaning) in a cathodic arc plasma prior to unbalanced magnetron deposition of transition metal nitride coatings {{on the performance}} of the coated components has been investigated. In particular the influence of parameters such as ion species, ion energy and exposure time on the changes in substrate surface topography, microstructure and microchemistry were studied employing transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, electron energy loss spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy. The consequences for both the microstructure of subsequently grown transition metal nitride coatings and their adhesion were elucidated. The relevance for practical applications was demonstrated using the example of <b>dry</b> <b>high-speed</b> milling tests, which showed that an appropriate choice of substrate surface pre-treatment parameters can double the life time of the coated tools. This was found to be due to an improved adhesion {{as a result of a}} combination of reduced oxygen incorporation at the interface between coating and substrate and local epitaxial growth of the coating. The latter is promoted by certain substrate surface pre-treatment procedures, which provide clean surfaces with preserved crystallographic order.

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the generation of}} a quasi monitoring system intended for an operator to change cutting tool during turning operation. The monitoring system uses the effects of turning variables on acoustic emission signal responses and factorial experimental design approach. In cutting op-erations, acoustic emission provides useful information concerning the tool wear condition because of the fundamental differences between its source mechanisms in the rubbing friction on the wear land of the single point tool. In this study, effects of cutting speed, feed and tool condition on the acoustic emission signal are investigated using acoustic emission’s energy, amplitude, and fre-quency response and 23 factorial design for turning operation. Cutting tests were performed using <b>high-speed</b> steel under <b>dry</b> conditions. Calculated effects, standard errors at 95 % confidence level, and models governing the acoustic emission response to the cutting conditions have been generated from the acoustic emission signal responses. The generated models revealed that acoustic energy response is affected by significant interactions between cutting speed and feed, and insignificant interactions between cutting speed and tool condition, while the acoustic amplitude response is af-fected by insignificant interactions among cutting speed, feed, and tool condition. These results sug-gest that acoustic emission’s energy and amplitude responses {{could be used to}} control the cutting speed and feed during turning operation, thus prolonging the life of the cutting tool...|$|R
5000|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} and four-wheel {{independent}} suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The M100 engine is a cast iron V8 with single overhead camshafts {{which was a}} bigger version of the engine also used in the Mercedes-Benz 600 and the Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3. Notable is the Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection, forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick {{was attached to the}} inside of the tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9 l (6,834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was rated at [...] and 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque, helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained <b>high-speed</b> cruising. The <b>dry</b> sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} high {{temperature}} and oxidation resistant, nanoscale, multilayer PVD, hard coatings {{have been developed}} through combine DC Unbalanced Magnetron (UBM) and High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HIPIMS) deposition technologies. The properties of the coatings lend themselves to the application of protecting cutting tools exposed to harsh environment such as the <b>dry,</b> <b>high-speed</b> machining of abrasive materials. This thesis discusses the literature supporting the project and pays tribute {{to the development of}} coatings that formed the foundation for the CrAlYBCN/AlSiCN coating series. Plasma diagnostics optimised the process conditions for deposition; a highly ionised metal rich plasma was generated to investigate the effect of process conditions during the pretreatment step. It was found that metal ion implantation into the substrate was successful and that ramping the cathode charge had little effect of the sputter rate of the substrate. Ion etching removed loosely bound surface grain to improve adhesion. A series of coatings were developed that were deposited at different levels of target poisoning, in an attempt to improve coating properties by process control and stoichiometry. Superhard coatings able to withstand temperatures of over 800 °C were produced. The coatings were subjected to a series of mechanical and thermal testing using pin on disk, microhardness, scratch test, Rockwell indentation, isothermal heat treatment and thermogravimetric analysis. Mechanisms of wear and oxidation process have been proposed based on the evidence given. Through coating development two coatings were indicated as having the desired chemical, thermal and mechanical properties suitable for cutting tests.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work done}} under a three-year PVMaT Phase 5 A 2 program. The overall goal was to attain a continuous, highly automated, fully integrated PV production line. In crystal growth, advances were made that resulted in lower substrate costs, higher yields, and lower capital and labor costs. A new string material was developed and implemented. Following this development, better control of the edge meniscus was achieved. A completely new furnace design was accomplished, and this became the standard platform in our new factory. Automation included ribbon thickness control and laser cutting of String Ribbon strips. Characterization of Evergreen's String Ribbon silicon was done with extensive help from the NREL laboratories, and this work provided a foundation for higher efficiency cells in the future. Advances in cell manufacturing included the development of <b>high-speed</b> printing and <b>drying</b> methods for Evergreen's unique cell making method and the design and building of a completely automated cell line {{from the beginning of}} front-contact application to the final tabbing of the cells. A so-called no-etch process whereby substrates from crystal growth go directly into p-n junction formation and emerge from this sequence without needing to go in and out of plastic carriers for any wet-chemical processing was developed. Process development as well as automation were brought to bear on improvements in soldering technology and cell interconnection in general. Using state-of-the-art manufacturing science, the Fraunhofer USA Center for Manufacturing Innovation at Boston University facilitated layout and process flow for the operation of our new factory.
