50|$|Contagion <b>default</b> {{modeling}} can {{be viewed}} as a variation of CID modeling. As discussed in section 2.3, in the CID framework, correlation is modeled by conditioning on a common market factor M, which impacts all entities to the same degree. The lower the random drawing for M, the higher is the <b>default</b> intensity of all entities (unless œÅ = 0). Hence CID modeling can elucidate <b>default</b> clustering. In contrast, contagion approaches model the <b>default</b> intensity of an entity as a function of the <b>default</b> of another entity. Hence contagion <b>default</b> modeling incorporates counterparty risk, i.e. the direct impact of a <b>defaulting</b> entity on the <b>default</b> intensity of another entity. In particular, after a <b>default</b> of a particular entity, the <b>default</b> intensity of all assets in the portfolio increases. This <b>default</b> contagion then typically fades exponentially to non-contagious <b>default</b> intensity levels. See the papers of Davis and Lo (2001) and Jarrow and Yu (2001), who pioneered contagion <b>default</b> modeling.|$|R

The pricing of credit <b>default</b> swaps can be signicantly aected by the correlation between market, reference credit, and counterparty <b>default</b> risk. In addition, because the sensitivity of basket credit <b>default</b> swap rates to market risk increases with the number of reference entities, the valuation error can be more sub-stantial in pricing basket credit <b>default</b> swaps than credit <b>default</b> swaps with a single reference entity when market risk is ignored...|$|R
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member <b>defaults.</b>|$|E

US10, which US127 crosses just south of the Clare County line. North of this line, US10 and US127 meet at a directional interchange.

Route4 {{northbound}} interchanges with Route403 at exit7; Route403, or the Quonset Freeway, is a four-lane, limited access freeway and spur route of Route4 that serves the Quonset Business Park and the village of Davisville. Heading southbound, exit7 is split into exit7B, which serves the Quonset Freeway, and exit7A, which serves Route402 (Frenchtown Road), another spur route connecting the highway to US1 and Route2. After exit7, Route4 continues northward as a six-lane expressway, passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of East Greenwich. The highway crosses under an overpass at Middle Road before interchanging with Route401, the freeway's final spur, at another partial cloverleaf interchange. Exit8 is also used to access Route2 and I-95 south, which has no direct freeway connection with Route4 north. Shortly after exit8, the Route4 designation ends and the mainline of the highway <b>defaults</b> onto I-95 north.|$|E

5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration said that it would cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for <b>defaults,</b> and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign <b>defaults</b> in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a systematic framework of stochastic modelling and prediction of financial <b>default</b> risk of construction contractors. Net-worth-to-asset ratio is identified as an index for <b>default</b> process modelling. The <b>default</b> condition is defined as when the ratio becomes negative the first time. A mean-reverting dynamic model for the contractor <b>default</b> process is found by statistical analysis and is justified by using the theory of optimal capital structure. The stochastic modelling of <b>default</b> uses the time to <b>default</b> as the fundamental random variable. A discrete time trinomial Markov chain model is developed to assess <b>default</b> risk in terms of a cumulative <b>default</b> probability function, a <b>default</b> probability function, and the mean and variance of time to <b>default.</b> Practical examples are given to illustrate the stochastic methods. A <b>default</b> discriminant study on a group of contractors and publicly traded companies validates the methods, and indicates a high predictability of events of <b>default</b> and declines of credit rating. ...|$|R

5|$|Financial {{integration}} among {{industrialized nations}} grew substantially during the 1980s and 1990s, as did liberalization of their capital accounts. Integration among financial markets and banks rendered {{benefits such as}} greater productivity and the broad sharing of risk in the macroeconomy. The resulting interdependence also carried a substantive cost in terms of shared vulnerabilities and increased exposure to systemic risks. Accompanying financial integration in recent decades was a succession of deregulation, in which countries increasingly abandoned regulations over the behavior of financial intermediaries and simplified requirements of disclosure {{to the public and}} to regulatory authorities. As economies became more open, nations became increasingly exposed to external shocks. Economists have argued greater worldwide financial integration has resulted in more volatile capital flows, thereby increasing the potential for financial market turbulence. Given greater integration among nations, a systemic crisis in one can easily infect others. The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of currency crises and sovereign <b>defaults,</b> including the 1987 Black Monday stock market crashes, 1992 European Monetary System crisis, 1994 Mexican peso crisis, 1997 Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the 1998‚Äì2002 Argentine peso crisis. These crises differed in terms of their breadth, causes, and aggravations, among which were capital flights brought about by speculative attacks on fixed exchange rate currencies perceived to be mispriced given a nation's fiscal policy, self-fulfilling speculative attacks by investors expecting other investors to follow suit given doubts about a nation's currency peg, lack of access to developed and functioning domestic capital markets in emerging market countries, and current account reversals during conditions of limited capital mobility and dysfunctional banking systems.|$|E
