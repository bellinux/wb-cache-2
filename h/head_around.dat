A tornado was {{observed}} near Nags <b>Head</b> <b>around</b> 17:40UTC on July 10, {{and a second}} was observed 25minutes later. Both tornadoes caused minimal damage– the first damaged four buildings and the second uprooted trees and toppled power poles. In addition, two waterspouts were noted offshore North Carolina, of which one was near New Topsail Beach in the mid-morning of July 8 and another near Sneads Ferry. No damage was reported from the waterspouts.|$|E

5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his <b>head</b> <b>around</b> at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E

They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's welcome and after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny. Events came to a <b>head</b> <b>around</b> Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E
25|$|During effacement, the cervix becomes {{incorporated}} into the lower segment of the uterus. During a contraction, uterine muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the lower segment, in a gradual expulsive motion.

25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him to bump his <b>head</b> <b>around</b> seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E
25|$|Van Dorn {{launched}} his offensive on March 5; {{when he discovered}} that Curtis was positioned behind fortifications located along the Little Sugar Creek, Van Dorn decided to march around the Union left flank and attack from the rear, starting the flanking march during the night of March 67. There was a delay as the Confederates had to construct a bridge over the Little Sugar Creek; by morning Price's division arrived at the Telegraph Road north of Curtis's fortifications, with McCulloch behind him and a rocky ridge called Big Mountain between the Confederates and the Union army. At this time, McCulloch received permission to <b>head</b> <b>around</b> the southern shoulder of Big Mountain and meet up with Price near Elkhorn Tavern, since this would shorten the distance he would travel. However, {{a portion of the}} Union army, commanded by Brigadier General Franz Sigel intercepted McCulloch's men near the southwest corner of Big Mountain. While an attack by Pike's brigade and Brigadier General James McIntosh's cavalry brigade drove back the Union forces from their initial positions, McCulloch was killed while scouting the second Union line, McIntosh was killed while leading a regiment into position, and Union reinforcements routed McCulloch's infantry brigade and captured its leader, Colonel Louis Hebert. Pike was able to rally a portion of the division and lead it back to the Bentonville Detour, where it marched around the northern end of Big Mountain and to Elkhorn Tavern. Colonel Elkanah Greer of the 3rd Texas Cavalry took command of another portion of the division and, after holding his position until after dark, also marched around Big Mountain to the tavern.|$|E

40|$|SummaryHumans and monkeys {{use both}} {{vestibular}} and visual motion (optic flow) cues to discriminate their direction of self-motion during navigation. A striking property of heading perception from optic flow is that discrimination is most precise when subjects judge small variations in <b>heading</b> <b>around</b> straight ahead, whereas thresholds rise precipitously when subjects judge <b>heading</b> <b>around</b> an eccentric reference. We show that vestibular heading discrimination thresholds in both humans and macaques also show a consistent, but modest, dependence on reference direction. We used computational methods (Fisher information, maximum likelihood estimation, and population vector decoding) {{to show that}} population activity in area MSTd predicts the dependence of heading thresholds on reference eccentricity. This dependence arises because the tuning functions for most neurons have a steep slope for directions near straight forward. Our findings {{support the notion that}} population activity in extrastriate cortex limits the precision of both visual and vestibular heading perception...|$|R
