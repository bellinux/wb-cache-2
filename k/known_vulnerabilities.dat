25|$|Cross-site {{scripting}} attacks use <b>known</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> in web-based applications, their servers, or the plug-in {{systems on}} which they rely. Exploiting one of these, attackers fold malicious content into the content being delivered from the compromised site. When the resulting combined content arrives at the client-side web browser, it has all been delivered from the trusted source, and thus operates under the permissions granted to that system. By finding ways of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, an attacker can gain elevated access-privileges to sensitive page content, to session cookies, and {{to a variety of}} other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the user. Cross-site scripting attacks are a case of code injection.|$|E
2500|$|Package {{management}} {{systems such as}} NPM and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep it secure and up to date, {{but that is not}} always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied upon libraries can release an update that causes bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the library. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with <b>known</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at-least one known vulnerability. [...] "The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago." [...] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from NPM. This caused all tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.|$|E

5000|$|The {{security}} of the MD5 has been severely compromised, with its weaknesses having been exploited in the field, most infamously by the Flame malware in 2012. The CMU Software Engineering Institute considers MD5 essentially [...] "cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use".

5000|$|There {{are three}} new {{scenarios}} which BROP [...] can be relevant for. They are:i.) In case of closed binary services, to discover vulnerabilities where techniques like fuzz and penetration testing {{need to be}} used.ii.) A <b>known</b> <b>vulnerability</b> in an open-source library can be leveraged to carry an exploit, even though the proprietary binary which uses it is a closed source.iii.) It {{can also be used}} to hack an open-source server for which the binary is unknown.The attack assumes that there is a service on the server which has a <b>known</b> stack <b>vulnerability</b> and also that the service should restart on crash.|$|R

25|$|Because Firefox {{generally}} has fewer publicly <b>known</b> security <b>vulnerabilities</b> than Internet Explorer (see Comparison of web browsers), improved security {{is often cited}} {{as a reason to}} switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox.

As a result, any exploit that leverages a <b>known</b> <b>vulnerability</b> will still operate successfully [9]. Although, a remote exploit gives the adversary control of a single virtual machine, by using the exploit in a virus the entire cloud could be compromised. It is this vulnerability amplification that poses the most significant threat to the future of cloud computing.|$|R

[...] Visitors to an infected site will be redirected to an alternative site containing further malware. Initially, this alternative site was gumblar.cn, {{but it has}} since switched {{to a variety of}} domains. The site sends the visitor an infected PDF that is opened by the visitor's browser or Acrobat Reader. The PDF will then exploit a <b>known</b> <b>vulnerability</b> in Acrobat {{to gain access to the}} user's computer. Newer variations of Gumblar redirect users to sites running fake anti-virus software.|$|R
2500|$|Rootkit {{installation}} can be automated, or an attacker can {{install it}} once they've obtained root or Administrator access. Obtaining this access {{is a result}} of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a <b>known</b> <b>vulnerability</b> (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like [...] "phishing"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. The key is the root or administrator access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.|$|R
