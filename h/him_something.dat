She believed that somebody had given <b>him</b> <b>something</b> that affected his central nervous system. She advised the aide {{to take him to the}} hospital.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for <b>him,</b> <b>something</b> that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made <b>him</b> <b>something</b> of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during the Watergate Scandal, after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|During {{his years}} at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he would indulge in light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the {{director}} of the physics laboratory, Luigi Puccianti, who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach <b>him</b> <b>something</b> instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a mathematical technique invented by Gregorio Ricci and Tullio Levi-Civita that was needed to demonstrate the principles of general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.|$|E
5|$|After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno to {{the three}} main {{characters}} from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began their careers in a classroom, though {{he added that the}} similarity was unintentional. During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents loved <b>him,</b> <b>something</b> the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father. In the first chapters of the series, Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to look like Naruto's face. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, praised the author for the way he handled Naruto's parents and his heritage.|$|E

25|$|Tynan's left-wing {{politics}} and lifestyle made <b>him</b> <b>something</b> of a {{poster boy for}} 1960s radical chic and champagne socialism in London.

25|$|Ulrica Arfvidsson, {{the famous}} medium of the Gustavian era, had told <b>him</b> <b>something</b> {{that could be}} {{interpreted}} as a prediction of his assassination in 1786, when he visited her anonymously – a coincidence - but she was known to have a large network of informers all over town to help her with her predictions, and she was in fact interrogated about the murder.|$|E
25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's reminders that the book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell <b>him</b> <b>something</b> about his mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|E

25|$|Along with Chris and Shaz, it is {{revealed}} that Ray Carling had previously {{died in the}} real world. As a young DC, he commits suicide by hanging himself on 6 May 1972, the day of that year's FA Cup Final.

25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show <b>him</b> <b>something.</b> She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|As G-3, Chamberlin {{was one of}} {{the most}} highly rated members of the GHQ staff, {{although}} not being part of the [...] "Bataan Gang" [...] – the group of officers who had escaped with MacArthur from the Philippines – made <b>him</b> <b>something</b> of an outsider at GHQ.

500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Bergkamp {{was accused of}} diving, and was {{referred}} to as a [...] "cheat" [...] and [...] "dirty player" [...] for retaliating against players who had previously challenged <b>him,</b> <b>something</b> his former manager Wenger denied. In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive: [...] "A lot of people there try to hurt you, not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach. There, {{it was a case of}} two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing." [...] Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration.|$|E
500|$|Siva was remade by Varma in Hindi as Shiva in 1990, and was Nagarjuna's acting {{debut in}} Hindi cinema. It {{was the last}} Hindi film with Amala in a lead role.

Ranga Agricultural University in Rajendranagar. Telugu filmmaker Puri Jagannadh was cast as one of Nagarjuna's friends in the remake. Jagannadh wanted to assist Varma and approached him for an opportunity.

In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad.

In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John."

When Jimmy is shot {{at the end of the}} episode trying to save his family from demons, Castiel returns, taking Jimmy's daughter as his new vessel. After the demons are killed, a dying Jimmy begs Castiel to take him back as a host so his daughter will not have to go through what he did, and the angel acquiesces. Dean then asks him what he needed to tell him, but Castiel coldly replies his loyalty is to Heaven, not to mankind or to him.|$|E
