5|$|The novella {{begins with}} 5-Liu Hsing, as a child, being taught about Earth {{through the use}} of virtual reality tapes, an {{experience}} which her younger self takes exception to. She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At the age of seven Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

Her {{thoughts}} {{begin to}} stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the Puritans as safe or even Christian. She still sees her sin, but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have. She begins {{to believe that a}} person's earthly sins don't necessarily condemn them. She even {{goes so far as to}} tell Dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin won't keep them from getting to heaven, however, the Puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns.|$|E
25|$|Olivia is a 29-year-old FBI Special Agent {{assigned}} to a multi-agency task force of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called the Fringe Division, after her partner and lover, John Scott, is exposed to a flesh-dissolving agent. Both Agent Broyles and Nina Sharp consider her to have much potential and talent, the latter even hoping to bring her on as an employee of Massive Dynamic. An experiment by Dr. Bishop to link her to the dying John Scott's mind {{in order to learn}} what he knew about his condition results in Olivia gaining part of his consciousness, causing her mind to begin integrating and purging the foreign consciousness.

At {{the end of}} one visit, Mrs. Mason reminds the girls that Mrs. Trueman [...] "loves truth, and she is ever exercising benevolence and love—from the insect, that she avoids treading on, her affection may be traced to that Being who lives for ever.—And it is from her goodness her agreeable qualities spring." [...] Wollstonecraft also adheres to the Lockean conception of the mind as a [...] "blank slate": in Original Stories, Mrs. Mason describes <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> using these same terms.|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Vir Sanghvi, in 2013, described Padukone as [...] "strong, {{someone who}} makes up <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> [...] has motivation within herself." [...] She is particularly {{known in the}} media as a professional, disciplined performer, whose [...] "work takes precedence over everything else." [...] A reviewer for Rediff.com described her personality as [...] "simple," [...] "grounded," [...] and [...] "accessible," [...] and wrote, [...] "She takes criticism in her stride, acknowledges her limitations and strives to work hard at getting better. She handles praise with equal composure." [...] Ayan Mukerji (the director of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani) considers her to be [...] "a woman who will flirt with you but you will love {{to take her home}} to meet your mom as well." [...] Padukone has maintained a Twitter account since 2010, and launched an official Facebook page in 2013.

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
500|$|Within {{the realm}} of the internet, the scene during which Jasmine kisses Jafar in order to {{distract}} him from Aladdin is oftentimes viewed as a point of contention among feminist writers and bloggers; Meredith Ancret of The Snark Who Hunts Back argued that both the Sultan and Genie are similarly enslaved by Jafar. Ancret continued to defend Jasmine for being of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> bravely defying Jafar on numerous occasions, and praised her distraction of the villain for being instrumental to Aladdin's success. Also defending Jasmine's decision to kiss Jafar, feminist critic Mari Rogers explained to The Daily Dot that [...] "Jasmine was a strong character and I think in many ways the story's focus on Aladdin sort of makes us forget this", concluding, [...] "Even in her own movie, she was always the force behind her decisions. She went out seeking things". Awarding Aladdin a [...] "neutral" [...] grade in terms of feminism, Fanny Pack wrote that [...] "What stops Aladdin from being wholly negative ... is the sheer strength of Jasmine as a character" [...] who [...] "seems to take the best parts of Ariel and Belle and build them into an even better, stronger, and sassier princess".|$|E
500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind.</b> Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lady Waltham (Amanda Donohue) - An aristocrat {{and sister}} of the {{deceased}} Clayton (originally intended to be his widow) who wants revenge on Tarzan for killing her brother (at least, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind).</b> She had her valet Hobson capture those close to him and then poison Tarzan. Tarzan was then given a challenge by Lady Waltham which was either save those he is close to from danger or head to a mountain she dubbed [...] "Clayton's Peak" [...] where the antidote is. Though Tarzan saves his friends and family, he ends up saving Lady Waltham from leopards. Afterwards, she gave Tarzan the antidote realizing that Tarzan would never have killed her brother on purpose. She is implied to have made peace with Tarzan and his family and has returned to her original life.|$|E
2500|$|The Girls' Room - A TV {{show that}} takes place in the girls' {{bathroom}} of a high school, but for one episode, took place in the boys' bathroom of the same school while a flood was being remedied in the girls' bathroom. The hosts are Amber, an egotistical girl who always makes sure to remind the audience that she is popular (although this just may be in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> as in one skit, a girl was asked what made Amber so popular, the girl responded that she did not know who Amber was; in another skit, Amber was not invited to the prom nor voted prom queen), Sheila, (played by Raquel Lee in season 1 and Reagan Gomez-Preston {{for the remainder of the}} series) an aggressive girl who disposes of unwelcome guests by giving them swirlies (usually executing them in the middle stall), Tammy (played by Jamie Snow), an [...] "exchange student" [...] from Tennessee with an extremely thick Southern accent, and Debbie, an unintelligent girl who constantly states that she likes eggs in a dopey voice (played by Jenna Morrison), and constantly annoys the others, especially Sheila. Amber has a rivalry with another, much more popular girl, Danielle Spencer, who always seems to one up Amber, but usually ends up getting a swirly from Sheila.|$|E

She saw that Alexis's phrase was wrong, but she did not clearly perceive what the sentence ought to be, and she perplexed herself over it till he came in, whether to her satisfaction or not she could not have told, for she had not wanted to see him on the one hand, though, on the other, it silenced Kalliope.|$|R
