25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the <b>dog</b> <b>hole</b> strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the <b>dog</b> <b>hole</b> strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and it has one or more <b>dog</b> <b>holes</b> on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the <b>dog</b> <b>holes</b> located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|Square <b>dog</b> <b>holes</b> may {{be created}} using a {{mortiser}} or {{by using a}} chisel {{in the same way}} that a mortise is created. However the most common way to make these holes is to cut a series of dadoes in the edge of one of the boards that will make up the benchtop. When the boards are laminated together to form the benchtop, the dadoes form the square holes that are required.|$|R
50|$|Bench dogs {{require some}} form of {{friction}} mechanism to prevent them falling through the <b>dog</b> <b>hole</b> when in use. This may be achieved by the installation of a strip of spring steel or wire {{on the side of}} the bench dog, or simply by making the bench dog a tight fit in the hole. There are various commercial dogs available which solve this problem in numerous ways.|$|E

In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which floods the area with white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game's young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat in the street. The boy hurriedly follows after him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tuxedo greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots.

50|$|A bench dog is an {{accessory}} {{used on a}} woodworking workbench to allow clamping of wooden items while being worked or planed. Dog in general is something which holds. At its most basic a bench dog is simply a peg which is installed in a corresponding <b>dog</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the top of}} a bench. The holes are arranged in a line perpendicular to the vise, perhaps three or four inches apart but certainly no further apart than the fully open distance between the vise's jaws.|$|E

60|$|Your German likes nature, but {{his idea}} of nature is a glorified Welsh Harp. He takes great {{interest}} in his garden. He plants seven rose trees {{on the north side}} and seven on the south, and if they do not grow up all the same size and shape it worries him so that he cannot sleep of nights. Every flower he ties to a stick. This interferes with his view of the flower, but he has the satisfaction of knowing it is there, and that it is behaving itself. The lake is lined with zinc, and once a week he takes it up, carries it into the kitchen, and scours it. In the geometrical centre of the grass plot, which is sometimes as large as a tablecloth and is generally railed round, he places a china dog. The Germans are very fond of dogs, but as a rule they prefer them of china. The china <b>dog</b> never digs <b>holes</b> in the lawn to bury bones, and never scatters a flower-bed to the winds with his hind legs. From the German point of view, he is the ideal dog. He stops where you put him, and he is never where you do not want him. You can have him perfect in all points, according to the latest requirements of the Kennel Club; or you can indulge your own fancy and have something unique. You are not, as with other dogs, limited to breed. In china, you can have a blue dog or a pink dog. For a little extra, you can have a double-headed dog.|$|R
60|$|Then all the foxes went south, {{and even}} the wolverine, that growling, blunt-headed little thief of the snow, {{did not take the}} trouble to follow the line of empty traps that Kotuko set. The tribe lost a couple of their best hunters, who were badly {{crippled}} in a fight with a musk-ox, and this threw more work on the others. Kotuko went out, day after day, with a light hunting-sleigh and six or seven of the strongest dogs, looking till his eyes ached for some patch of clear ice where a seal might perhaps have scratched a breathing-hole. Kotuko the dog ranged far and wide, and in the dead stillness of the ice-fields Kotuko the boy could hear his half-choked whine of excitement, above a seal-hole three miles away, as plainly as though he were at his elbow. When the <b>dog</b> found a <b>hole</b> the boy would build himself a little, low snow wall to keep off the worst of the bitter wind, and there he would wait ten, twelve, twenty hours for the seal to come up to breathe, his eyes glued to the tiny mark he had made above the hole to guide the downward thrust of his harpoon, a little seal-skin mat under his feet, and his legs tied together in the tutareang (the buckle that the old hunters had talked about). This helps to keep a man's legs from twitching as he waits and waits and waits for the quick-eared seal to rise. Though there is no excitement in it, you can easily believe that the sitting still in the buckle with the thermometer perhaps forty degrees below zero is the hardest work an Inuit knows. When a seal was caught, Kotuko the dog would bound forward, his trace trailing behind him, and help to pull the body to the sleigh, where the tired and hungry dogs lay sullenly under the lee of the broken ice.|$|R
40|$|The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer {{mission has}} {{unveiled}} a rare population of high-redshift (z = 1 – 4. 6), dusty, hyper-luminous galaxies, with infrared luminosities L[subscript IR] > 10 [superscript 13] L[subscript ⊙], and sometimes exceeding 10 [superscript 14] L[subscript ⊙]. Previous work {{has shown that}} their dust temperatures and overall far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are significantly hotter than expected to be powered by star formation. We present here {{an analysis of the}} rest-frame optical through mid-infrared SEDs for a large sample of these so-called "hot, dust-obscured galaxies" (Hot DOGs). We find that the SEDs of Hot DOGs are generally well modeled by the combination of a luminous, yet obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that dominates the rest-frame emission at λ > 1 µm and the bolometric luminosity output, and a less luminous host galaxy that is responsible for the bulk of the rest optical/UV emission. Even though the stellar mass of the host galaxies may be as large as 10 [superscript 11]– 10 [superscript 12] M[subscript ⊙], the AGN emission, with a range of luminosities comparable to those of the most luminous QSOs known, require that either Hot <b>DOGs</b> have black <b>hole</b> masses significantly in excess of the local relations, or that they radiate significantly above the Eddington limit, at a level at least 10 times more efficiently than z ~ 2 QSOs. We show that, while rare, the number density of Hot DOGs is comparable to that of equally luminous but unobscured (i. e., Type 1) QSOs. This may be at odds with the trend suggested at lower luminosities for the fraction of obscured AGNs to decrease with increasing luminosity. That trend may, instead, reverse at higher luminosities. Alternatively, Hot DOGs may not be the torus-obscured counterparts of the known optically selected, largely unobscured, hyper-luminous QSOs, and may represent a new component of the galaxy evolution paradigm. Finally, we discuss the environments of Hot DOGs and statistically show that these objects are in regions as dense as those of known high-redshift proto-clusters...|$|R
