40|$|Background and Purpose: Providing {{a win-win}} {{situation}} for enterprises and the environment is raising the importance of eco-innovation. This article sheds light on the <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> implemented within the clusters of the South Eastern European region (hereafter the SEE region).

40|$|Malta is characterised by {{its small}} size, its climatological {{parameters}} and its long coastline. This sets {{the context for}} specific <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> to be stimulated and developed not only for local use but also for international replication. Europe is going through difficult economic times which have had their knock on effect on most countries of which Malta is no exception. However, during 2010, GDP registered an increase of 3. 2...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Eco-innovation is {{any form}} of product, process or {{organisational}} innovation that contributes towards sustainable development. Firms can eco-innovate {{in a variety of}} ways. In this paper we identify nine different <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> - including such items as reducing material use per unit of output, reducing energy use per unit of output, reducing CO 2 'footprint' - and we ask whether these act as substitutes or complements to one another. Design/ Methodology/ Approach Using data for over 2, 000 Irish firms collected in a special module included in the sixth Community Innovation Survey we test whether the introduction of two <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> over {{a short period of time}} provide a greater (lesser) benefit to the firm, in terms of turnover, than the introduction of these eco-innovations individually. Findings Introducing only one eco-innovation activity has little payoff (in terms of turnover per worker) with only those firms who reduce their CO 2 'footprint' having higher levels of turnover per worker. When introducing more than one eco-innovation activity we find that certain <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> complement one another (e. g. reducing material use within the firm at the same time as improving the ability to recycle the product after use) others act as substitutes (e. g. reducing material use within the firm at the same time as recycling waste, water, or materials within the firm). Practical Implications Our results suggest that firms can maximise their productive capacity by considering specific combinations of eco-innovation. This suggests that firms should plan to introduce eco-innovation which act as complements, thereby, boosting productivity. It also suggests that eco-innovation stimuli, introduced by policy makers, should be targeted at complementary eco-innovations. Originality We analyse whether eco-innovations act as complements or substitutes. While a number of studies have analysed the importance of eco-innovation for firm performance, few have assessed the extent to which diverse types of eco-innovation interact with each other to complement or substitute one another. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the usefulness of}} patent analysis for measuring eco-innovation. The overall conclusion is that patents are a useful means for measuring environmentally motivated innovations, such as pollution control technologies and green energy technologies, and for general purpose technologies with environmental benefits. For these types of innovations it is acceptable to use patent analysis, provided they are carefully screened. Patent analysis {{may be used for}} measuring five attributes of eco-innovation: (1) eco-inventive activities in specific technology fields, (2) international technological diffusion, (3) research and technical capabilities of companies, (4) institutional knowledge sources of eco-innovation, and (5) technological spillovers and knowledge flows. Up until now it is mainly used for measuring eco-inventive <b>activity.</b> <b>Eco-innovation,</b> patents...|$|R

40|$|Many recent papers {{deal with}} {{exploring}} and explaining {{the determinants of}} eco-innovations for different countries supporting the formulation of efficient policy measures to trigger <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> of firms. Unfortunately, {{there is still a}} lack of cross-country analyses allowing recognizing “international” stylized facts, but also regional characteristics of eco-innovations. Based on data from the fourth Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for France and Germany, the present paper tries to contribute to fill this gap. Using econometric methods, we are able to detect remarkable similarities between the different determinants of eco-innovation in the two countries. The results confirm the central role of regulation and cost savings as motivations for eco-innovation. Furthermore, eco-innovative activities seem to require more external sources of knowledge and information than innovation in general. Eco-Innovation, Industry, Discrete Choice Models...|$|E
40|$|Innovative {{solutions}} are often conjured {{as a key}} factor for companies to come closer {{to the goal of}} ecological sustainability. Furthermore, proactive <b>eco-innovation</b> <b>activities</b> can encompass competitive advantages. Companies are therefore well advised to tap any available source of innovation. However, although employees’ innovative capacity has often been described, to date, their manifold potentials for eco-innovation processes have hardly been examined in detail. The overarching research questions guiding this conceptual paper are why and how employee participation in eco-innovation processes can entail environmental and competitive advantages for companies. The authors introduce the concept of employee-driven eco-innovation (EDEI), defined here as ordinary employees’ voluntary engagement in innovation activities within an organizational context that, intentionally or not, lead to environmental improvements. This paper complements previous literature on employee-driven innovation (EDI) by applying it to the specific case of eco-innovation. In this context, employees’ comprehensive environmental competences resulting from “tacit knowledge”, “private consumer experience” and “green identity” are taken into account. In addition, we delineate critical intra-organizational factors for EDEI activities and illustrate green employees’ specific requirements in this regard...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of transitioning to an environmentally sustainable system {{of production and}} consumption is both a major risk and a significant opportunity for companies involved {{in the design and}} manufacture of products. One approach that might assist companies in meeting this challenge is ‘eco-innovation’, which aims to deliver new products and processes that provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts. The aim of the research was to understand how eco-innovation tools can be developed and introduced to a company such that they are adopted into the long-term practices of the company and {{contribute to the development of}} eco-innovative products. A ‘toolbox for eco-innovation’ was developed by adapting existing innovation tools for the purposes of eco-innovation. The initial toolbox was tested through in-house trials before subsequent trials in industry with a refined suite of tools. One-day workshops were held with six producers of electrical and electronic equipment. Four of these companies went on to participate in more in-depth tool introduction studies in which the tools were customised to the specific needs of the company and its design team. Formal tool feedback sessions and individual interviews with members of the design team were used to asses the effectiveness of the tool customisations. The organisational drivers and barriers for the long-term adoption of eco-innovation tools were also investigated. The contributions to knowledge of this research are: The development of a toolbox for eco-innovation. The validation of tool customisation as an approach to improving the introduction of eco-innovation tools. The definition of a generic process for tool introduction based on tool customisation which is appropriate for workshop-based design and innovation tools (including eco-innovation tools).
