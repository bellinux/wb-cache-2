5|$|Fearing {{that the}} <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war,</b> recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|British {{relations}} were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French {{leaders such as}} Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|France outlawed {{the most}} radical {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> and {{the assassination of the}} party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the tenure}} of the Kennedy Administration, as an {{additional}} background to the Cold War there was the onset of low intensity <b>guerrilla</b> <b>wars</b> and wars of insurgency with proxies of the Soviet Union.

5|$|In the Mediterranean, a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> {{waged by}} Greek Cypriots ended in 1960 {{leading to an}} {{independent}} Cyprus, with the UK retaining the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of Malta, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of integration with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the crossing, and began a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curicó, demoralized the royalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the South Kasaian soldiers were integrated into the ANC after {{the dissolution of the}} state but nearly 2,000 loyalists went into hiding to await Kalonji's possible restoration. The rebels were led by General Mwanzambala and fought a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> against the new provincial government until 1963 when they also accepted integration into the ANC. Soon {{after the end of the}} secession, the city of Bakwanga was renamed Mbuji-Mayi.|$|E

5|$|The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, {{received}} overwhelming endorsement in {{the general}} election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war,</b> which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).|$|E

Finally, while leading a small foco band of guerrilla cadres in Bolivia, Che Guevara was captured and killed. His death, and the short-term failure of his Guevarist tactics, may have interrupted the component <b>guerrilla</b> <b>wars</b> {{within the larger}} Cold War for a time, and even temporarily discouraged Soviet and Cuban sponsorship for foquismo.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a well}} {{accepted}} {{idea that}} without the Japanese invasion, the CPC might not have developed so fast. This accelerated development is attributed by some {{to the lack of}} attention the CPC paid to the war against Japan, they argue that the Chinese Communists took advantage of the KMT's preoccupation with the Japanese to gain an edge on the nationalists. This, however, wasn't entirely true as the Chinese Communists did wage costly Hundred Regiments Offensive and <b>guerrilla</b> <b>wars</b> against Japanese occupied areas.|$|R
5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between {{the two sides of the}} Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E

Cortana reveals that Halo's activation would mean their own destruction. Master Chief and Cortana instead detonate Autumns engines, destroying Halo and preventing the escape of the Flood.|$|E
5|$|The Lusitani revolted {{again in}} 146 BC {{under a new}} leader called Viriathus, invading Turdetania (southern Iberia) in a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war.</b> The Lusitanians were {{initially}} successful, defeating a Roman army at the Battle of Tribola and going on to sack nearby Carpetania, and then besting a second Roman army at the First Battle of Mount Venus in 146 BC, again going on to sack another nearby city. In 144 BC, the general Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus campaigned successfully against the Lusitani, but failed in his attempts to arrest Viriathus.|$|E
5000|$|The Kennedy Administration further {{stressed}} the importance of rapid global mobility in his first State of the Union Address stating “Obtaining air transport mobility—and obtaining it now—will better assure the ability of our conventional forces to respond, with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at a moment’s notice.” [...] The President wanted the U.S. to have the capability to prevent both limited and <b>guerrilla</b> <b>wars</b> by being able to rapidly deploy military forces around the world.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Sissi' means 'guerrilla' or 'partisan' in the Finnish language, it doesn't mean {{paramilitary}} {{or illegal}} troops without a controlling high command and government. The name only points towards the tactics used in historical <b>guerrilla</b> <b>wars</b> (Freedom fighters / Terrorists). This {{is an important}} difference to note as, unlike guerrilla combatants, Finnish sissi don't hide in the local population and they always carry a belt, cockade, rifle and other signs which makes these units a legal fighting force, by the UN legal definition, alongside regular units.|$|R

5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
5|$|Worn {{down by the}} {{communist}} <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam. In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower's United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam's pro-Western regime against communist efforts to destabilize it.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war,</b> capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} recent findings is {{that the end of the}} Cold War had no impact on internal conflict. We show that this an artifact of neglecting an important source of heterogeneity in civil wars: their “technology of rebellion. ” After disaggregating civil wars into irregular (or <b>guerrilla)</b> <b>wars,</b> conventional wars, and symmetric non-conventional wars, we find a striking decline of irregular wars following the end of the Cold War, something that amounts to a profound transformation of civil war. Our analysis brings the international system back into the study of internal conflict, underlines the relevance of warfare for the study of civil wars, and demonstrates that the prevalence of irregular war is not transhistorical, as widely believed; rather, it is closely associated with the structural dynamics of the Cold War...|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} goal of Alcora Exercise was {{to investigate}} the processes and means by which a coordinated tripartite effort between the three countries could face the mutual threat to their territories in Southern Africa. The immediate goal was to face the African revolutionary movements that fought <b>guerrillas</b> <b>wars</b> against the Portuguese authorities in Angola and Mozambique, to limit the spread of the action of these movements in South West Africa and Rhodesia and to prepare the defense of the Portuguese, South African and Rhodesian territories against an expected conventional military aggression from the hostile governments of the African neighbor countries.|$|R
5|$|San Martín and Belgrano {{met at the}} Yatasto relay. The {{army was}} in poor condition, and San Martín {{initially}} refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it would hurt the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Martín acted as instructed. San Martín stayed {{only a few weeks}} in Tucumán, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> waged by Martín Miguel de Güemes against the royalists, similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Martín trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.|$|E
5|$|The Malayan Emergency was a <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> {{between the}} Federation of Malaya—a {{protectorate}} of Britain until August 1957, {{and part of}} the Commonwealth of Nations thereafter—and the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). The MNLA sought to topple the Malayan government and force the British out, while the Commonwealth worked to prevent this. The conflict had its roots in the Second World War, in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking, and called themselves the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army.|$|E
5|$|The Romans faced further reverses on the {{battlefield}} and a savage <b>guerrilla</b> <b>war</b> in the Bosnian mountains. It took them three years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian Suetonius,writing in c. AD 100, as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the Punic Wars over two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally succeeded in quelling the revolt in 9AD. This was apparently lucky timing for the Romans: that same year Arminius destroyed Varus' three legions in Germany. The Roman high command {{had no doubt that}} Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.|$|E
