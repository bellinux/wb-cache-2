5000|$|The World Skijoring Championships {{have been}} held in Whitefish, Montana since 2009, {{as a part of}} the annual Whitefish Winter Carnival, usually the last weekend of January. The 2011 World Skijoring Championships had an actual purse of $19,580 and 91 teams, and also {{featured}} a [...] "Murdoch's Long Jump" [...] competition as a separate class, where a horseman pulls a skier straight ahead as fast as possible, with the skier jumping for maximum distance, similar to <b>gelandesprung,</b> but landing on the flat. Skiers are required to land upright. Some teams emphasize a speed-acceleration [...] "crack-the-whip" [...] effect by either having the horse veer to the side immediately before the jump, or the skier will carve his or her own crack-the-whip before attempting the jump. The long jump itself is an 8-10 foot jump and the 2011 winning distance was 56 feet.|$|E
