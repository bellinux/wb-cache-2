5|$|In 1995 {{the team}} regressed further, losing even more players to free agency and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 5–11 record, their worst since Bill Parcells' first season in 1983. Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. Reeves went public with his desire to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> say in personnel matters. He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, and the fans pelting the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game. Though the defense still played well at times, the Giants sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E

Rachel was thoroughly convinced her son would be instrumental in breaking up the Frame marriage and snagging her Steve once and for all. She enlisted the help of her drifter father, Gerald (Walter Mathews), who tricked Alice into finding Steve and Rachel in a compromising position. Alice filed for divorce and left town again.

25|$|In 1998, the {{majority}} of chapters fell below minimum chapter size, were in violation of hazing or alcohol policy or did not meet financial obligations. This caused many programs such as Compass Point and Reflections to help chapters grow and look at chapter life. The National Office also began to improve communication {{through the development of}} a national website. In 2003, a fine was instated for chapters with a number of girls under the campus total number of girls possible to recruit. This controversial fine was created with the intention of keeping chapters active in recruitment. The following year a GPA minimum and value based recruitment system were in place as a way to strengthen chapter membership. Theta Phi Alpha approved the expansion of its Grand Council from five to seven members in 2006 to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> focus on assisting chapters as well.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even greater likelihood of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|The transit {{strike was}} the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city {{complete}} control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result, in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of Ocean Hill-Brownsville, one of the neighborhoods where the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community-run school board. The UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers, citing that the teachers had been fired without due process. When their demands were ignored, the UFT called the first of three strikes, leading ultimately to a protracted citywide teachers' strike that stretched over a seven-month period between May and November. The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors. Many thought the mayor had made a bad situation worse by taking sides against the teachers. The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years, and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.|$|E

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song to get excited about the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening." [...] The album concludes with [...] "Everytime I Eat Vegetables It Makes Me Think of You", which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a [...] "sing along." ...|$|E

2500|$|In England the Renaissance {{tended to}} {{manifest}} itself in large square tall houses such as Longleat House.

2500|$|During this stint, Werber {{used the}} Kingston Trio's local {{popularity}} {{to try to}} generate interest from record companies. After several false starts, the group landed a contract with Capitol Records, recording their first album in three days in February 1958. The producer was the already legendary (from Frank Sinatra's 1950s Capitol sessions) Voyle Gilmore, who made two immediate and fateful decisions. Gilmore insisted that the trio's acoustic sound <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "bottom" [...] and added a bass player to the recordings.

2500|$|A typical {{problem for}} a {{statistically}} oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap.

2500|$|Grounding {{the right}} to life in {{essential}} natural capacities rather than accidental developed capacities is said to have several advantages.

2500|$|Prelate Michael Arneth noticed Bruckner's bad {{situation}} in Windhaag and awarded him a teacher's assistant {{position in the}} vicinity of the monastic town of Sankt Florian, sending him to Kronstorf an der Enns for two years.

Between 1843 and 1845, Bruckner was the pupil of Leopold von Zenetti in Enns. Compared to the few works he wrote in Windhaag, the Kronstorf compositions from 1843–1845 show a significantly improved artistic ability, and finally the beginnings of what could be called [...] "the Bruckner style". Among the Kronstorf works is the vocal piece Asperges me (WAB 4), which the young teacher's assistant, out of line of his position, signed with [...] "Anton Bruckner m.p.ria. Comp".
