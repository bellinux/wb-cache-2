5|$|Nakajima {{made his}} debut for Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX on July 9, 2005, winning a six-man junior tag team match. He {{went on to}} defeat Osamu Namiguchi on August 31 for his first singles title, the WWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship, though whether this can be {{considered}} part of the title's official lineage is disputed. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until June 24, 2006, losing the title to premier ZERO1-MAX junior Tatsuhito Takaiwa. This is to date Nakajima's last appearance with the promotion.|$|E
5|$|On November 28, 1983, Rob Gerhardt {{reached a}} record score of 33,273,520 {{points in a}} Q*bert marathon. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for almost 30 years, until George Leutz from Brooklyn, NY played one game of Q*bert for eighty-four hours and forty-eight minutes on February 14–18, 2013 at Richie Knucklez' Arcade in Flemington, NJ. He scored 37,163,080 points.|$|E
5|$|Vandoorne {{retained}} his {{pole position}} {{advantage in the}} first race, which was disrupted on the fourth lap following a collision between Norman Nato, Arthur Pic, Pierre Gasly and Raffaele Marciello. Drivers on the soft-compound tyres made pit stops for medium-compound tyres, while Vandoorne remained the leader for the lap-nine restart. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until his pit stop {{at the end of}} lap 22, and Rossi moved into the first position on the following lap. He kept the position until Vandoorne overtook him to win the race. Julián Leal started first in the second race and remained the leader until he was passed {{at the beginning of the}} eighth lap by Haryanto, who maintained the lead for the rest of the race to clinch the win.|$|E

5|$|Dixon {{moved to}} the track's outside at the third turn on lap 216. and made heavy {{contact with the outside}} wall which he slid against. His {{right-hand}} side was heavily damaged and his right-rear wheel became detached and the final caution was prompted. Da Matta battled Papis for first place after holding it while the field was under caution. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for the remaining four laps to win the race. Papis finished second with Tagliani third. Junqueira took fourth and Kanaan finished in fifth. De Ferran, Andretti, Mears, Barron and Carpentier rounded out the top ten. Serviá, Vasser, Fittipadi, Gidley, Takagi and Jourdain were the last of the classified finishers. There were a record-breaking 73 lead changes in the race; 19 drivers reached the front of the field. Papis' total of 54 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Da Matta led 16 times, for a total of 53 laps. The victory was the fourth of da Matta's CART career, his second in a row, and the final of three victories he posted in the 2001 season. The attrition race was low, with 16 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
5|$|Drainage {{problems}} with the circuit caused {{the first two days}} of the event to be cancelled. Bräck — the season points leader heading into the race — was awarded the pole position. The original distance of the race was reduced from 210 laps to 168. Bräck lost the lead on the first lap to de Ferran who held the first position for the next 44 laps. Bräck passed de Ferran to reclaim the lead on the 45th lap and remained the leader until the second round of pit stops. The race distance was further reduced by series race director Chris Kneifel from 168 to 140 laps because of a danger from fading daylight. Gil de Ferran held the first position until he was held up by a slower car on the race's penultimate lap which allowed Bräck to retake the lead. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until de Ferran overtook him on the final lap winning the race. It was de Ferran's first victory of the season, his second on an oval track, and the sixth of his career. There were three cautions and five lead changes {{during the course of the}} race.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

5|$|With {{his eldest}} son dead, Henry rearranged {{the plans for the}} succession: Richard was to be made king of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would have to retain Brittany, as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> by marriage, so Henry's {{favourite}} son John would become the duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard. Richard, however, refused to give up Aquitaine; he was deeply attached to the duchy, and had no desire to exchange this role for the meaningless one of being the junior King of England. Henry was furious, and ordered John and Geoffrey to march south and retake the duchy by force. The short war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation at Westminster in England at the end of 1184. Henry finally got his own way in early 1185 by bringing Eleanor to Normandy to instruct Richard to obey his father, while simultaneously threatening to give Normandy, and possibly England, to Geoffrey. This proved enough and Richard finally handed over the ducal castles in Aquitaine to Henry.|$|E
25|$|Alesi's clutch failed on lap 43 and Piquet had {{wheel bearing}} {{troubles}} two laps later and thus Gachot was fifth. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until he spun off on lap 52.

25|$|Along {{with his}} brother Jo and the radio presenters Mike Read and Paul Gambaccini, he was a co-founder of the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and served as an editor from 1977 to 1996.

25|$|On February 2, 1989, {{managed by}} Dutch Mantel, he debuted as The Master of Pain, a {{character}} {{fresh out of}} the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta after serving five years (much in solitary confinement) for killing two men in a fight. After his second match the next week, {{he stayed in the}} ring by challenging USWA Unified World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lawler to an impromptu match. The Master of Pain easily dominated Lawler until Mantel entered the ring and called him off. Lawler agreed to a title match, which was held on April 1, when The Master of Pain won his first professional wrestling championship. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for just over three weeks before Lawler became the first man to pin him, winning it back.|$|E
25|$|Graduates from West Point and Mexican War {{veterans}} {{were highly}} sought after by Jefferson Davis for military service, especially as general officers. Like their Federal counterparts, the Confederate Army had both professional and political generals within it. Ranks throughout the CSA were roughly {{based on the}} U.S. Army in design and seniority. On February 27, 1861, a general staff for the army was authorized, consisting of four positions: an adjutant general, a quartermaster general, a commissary general, and a surgeon general. Initially the last of these {{was to be a}} staff officer only. The post of adjutant general was filled by Samuel Cooper (the position he had held as a colonel in the U.S. Army from 1852 until resigning) and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> throughout the Civil War, as well as the army's inspector general.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 1950s Bull Curry {{relocated}} to Texas to work. Curry’s combination of unpredictable violence, unique look and intensity made Curry a big star in Texas more or less immediately upon arrival. Curry’s brawling style made him a success but it also kept the promoters from giving him the “main” title of the territory despite being the biggest draw in the territory. Instead of letting Bull Curry win the top title of the Texas territory the bookers created a brand new title to match Bull Curry’s Hardcore style of wrestling: the NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship which Bull Curry won in a tournament final over Danny McShain on March 6, 1953. Between 1953 and 1967 “Wild Bull” Curry personified the Texas Brass Knuckles Championship as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> 20 times defeating such names as Fritz Von Erich, Tony Borne, Waldo Von Erich, Louie Tillet, Killer Karl Kox and Brute Bernard for the title. In 1953 Curry would also briefly hold the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Lucas Pertano as well as the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship for three weeks but soon focused solely on the Brass Knuckles Title.|$|E
25|$|Louisa Hamer, (Plaintiff), brought {{suit against}} Franklin Sidway, the {{executor}} {{of the estate}} of William E. Story I, (Defendant), for the sum of $5,000. On March 20, 1869, William E. Story had promised his nephew, William E. Story II, $5,000 if his nephew would abstain from drinking alcohol, using tobacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until the nephew reached 21 years of age. Story II accepted the promise of his uncle and did refrain from the prohibited acts until he turned the agreed-upon age of 21. After celebrating his 21st birthday on January 31, 1875, Story II wrote to his uncle and requested the promised $5,000. The uncle responded to his nephew in a letter dated February 6, 1875 in which he told his nephew that he would fulfill his promise. Story I also stated that he would prefer to wait until his nephew was older before actually handing over the (then) extremely large sum of money (according to an online inflation calculator, $5000 in 1890 would be worth approximately $130,000 in 2017). The elder Story also declared in his letter that the money owed to his nephew would accrue interest while <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> on his nephew's behalf. The younger Story consented to his uncle's wishes and agreed that the money would remain with his uncle until Story II became older. William E. Story I died on January 29, 1887 without having transferred any of the money owed to his nephew. Story II had meanwhile transferred the $5,000 financial interest to his wife; Story II's wife had later transferred this financial interest to Louisa Hamer on assignment. The elder Story's estate refused to grant Hamer the money, believing there was no binding contract {{due to a lack}} of consideration. As a result, Hamer sued the estate's executor, Franklin Sidway.|$|E
