40|$|Within the EU Regulatory Framework, licensees for {{commercial}} radio broadcasting may be charged a fee to ensure optimal allocation of scarce resources {{but not to}} maximize public revenues. In this paper, it is described how such a fee can be determined {{for the purpose of}} licence renewal or extension. In the case at hand, national and regional Dutch FM licences were valued, taking into account that simulcast broadcasting of digital and analogue radio will be obligatory upon extension. Licences are valued using Discounted Cash Flow Methodology, whereby the cash flows of an averagely efficient entrant are taken as the benchmark for valuation of each <b>individual</b> <b>licence.</b> Cash flows during the licence period 2011 - 2017 are forecasted based on Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regressions, using financial variables of Dutch radio stations for the years 2004 - 2008. Separately, bottom-up cost and investment models are used to calculate analogue and digital distribution costs. The GLS and distribution cost models per cash flow variable, discounted to 2011, result in a value per licence based on objective licence characteristics. These values can be used to set licence fees if administrative renewal or extension is opted for instead of a new auction or beauty contest. Although such a model-based valuation creates stability for listeners and broadcasters as compared to an auction which has more uncertain market outcomes, it is inevitable that fees based on econometric analysis and market forecasts will be scrutinized by licensees and may be subject to legal procedures. While radio licence renewal occurs in many EU countries, an objective, model-based approach for setting licence fees has not been used so far. Yet, it is argued that such an approach, taking an averagely efficient entrant as a starting point, is most in line with the EU Regulatory Framework...|$|E

Exactly what harm is caused directly by nitrogen and phosphorus is a matter of debate. While these nutrients are not specifically regulated in AS/NZS 1547 : 2000, most Australian States and Territories require on-site treatment systems to achieve set reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus before a technology gains type approval.

The 2001 <b>Individual</b> <b>Licenced</b> Sample of Anonymised Records for Imputation Analysis (I-SAR) is a 3 % sample of individuals for all countries of the United Kingdom, with approximately 1. 84 million records. The data are available for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Information is included for each individual on the main demographic, health, socio-economic and household variables. The 3 % sample is an increase by comparison with 2 % in 1991. Some variables have been broad-banded to reduce disclosure risk. The lowest level of geography is the Government Office Region (GOR), although Inner and Outer London are separately identified. This represents a significant reduction by comparison with the 1991 where large Local Authorities (population 120, 000 and over) were separately identified. This dataset contains 173 variables, including 84 imputation flag variables. The standard version, containing 89 I-SAR variables, is available under SN 7205. Main Topics : The dataset includes information on age, gender, ethnicity, health, employment status, housing, amenities, family type, geography, social class, education, distance to work, workplace, hours worked and migration. In addition, the ONS have added occupational coding, not available in the Census tables, for individuals aged 16 - 65 who last worked more than 5 years ago but less than ten years ago and for those aged 65 - 74 who were not currently working at the Census but who {{had worked in the}} previous ten years.

Local Authority is {{the lowest level of}} geography for England and Wales, Council Areas for Scotland and Parliamentary Constituencies for Northern Ireland. The Scilly Isles have been merged with Penwith and the City of London with Westminster. Orkney and Shetland are merged into one area. All other areas are identified. The median sample size for an authority is 5, 600 records and nearly eighty authorities have more than 10, 000 records. The amount of individual detail in the SAM is less than in the 2001 <b>Individual</b> <b>Licenced</b> Sample of Anonymised Records (I-SAR) (see under SNs 7205 and 7206) because of the greater geographical detail in the SAM. Caveat - Students: As with the Individual SAR, the SAM includes those enumerated in a communal establishment and also full-time students who were enumerated at an address that was not their usual term-time residence. For the latter there is only individual-level information on age, sex, marital status and full-time student status. It is recommended that these students are not included in any analyses as they do not form part of the usual residents population base.

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} online use by libraries of in-copyright works in their collections, especially cross-border use within Europe and how such use is affected by copyright. The aim is to explore options for a legal framework which would allow libraries {{to operate in the}} digital world. Operating in the digital world entails granting access to works online while supporting the necessary balance of rights and obligations between rightholders and users. Obtaining <b>individual</b> <b>licences</b> for the use of in-copyright works held by libraries can be complicated and costly, in particular for cross-border use. Thus individual licensing is not a practical solution for libraries except for the use of a few well-defined works. Barring individual licensing there are two main approaches to providing a legal basis for online use by libraries. One approach entails introducing further limitations and exceptions for the benefit of libraries, the other entails promoting collective licensing with legislative support, such as extended collective licences. Both options are looked at in the research. However, given the impact of online use even just within Europe, the view is taken that licensing is a more appropriate and flexible tool than exceptions for online use of in-copyright works. Thus the main emphasis of the research is devoted to assessing whether collective licencing with legislative support, such as the system of extended collective licenses, could provide the necessary flexibility and legal security to facilitate the online use of in-copyright works by digital libraries without geographical restriction within Europe. The conclusion is that national extended collective licences are well suited to facilitating cross-border online use within Europe provided certain safeguard measures are in place. However, to provide more legal certainty for such a solution for cross-border use EU legislation would be preferable. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Unconventional gas {{development}} {{provides a}} fascinating opportunity for better understanding how {{the intersection of}} local social structure and external industrial pressures shape rural landscapes. Previous research on social responses to unconventional gas development (UGD) explores motivations for supporting or opposing industry development. Research has revealed differing perceptions {{in areas where the}} UGD industry emerged early versus later on (or not at all). We take up the question of why systematic differences may exist between regions at different stages of development, integrating social representations theory with the concept of social licence to operate to explain differences in attitudes to UGD. Born to social psychology, social representations theory describes how communities characterise concepts, ideas, or objects. Social representations underpin the development of community views, opinions, attitudes and behaviours, and are useful for understanding how communities respond to novel industrial developments (Deaux & Philogène, 2001; Evensen and Stedman, 2016; Moscovici, 2001). Social representations are collectively generated characterisations of an issue that are then internalised to various extents by <b>individuals.</b> ‘Social <b>licence</b> to operate’ is also a community-level attribute that has a mix of societal-level and individual-level antecedents. The concept of social licence to operate provides a frame for understanding community responses to industrial developments, upon which a spectrum of community views, opinions, attitudes and behaviours can be placed (Dare, Schirmer, & Vanclay, 2014; Luke, Lloyd, Boyd, & den Exter, 2014 b; Thomson & Boutilier, 2011). Social representations could include portrayals of both the effects of UGD and of the UGD industry, each potentially shaping assessment {{of the extent to which}} social licence may exist or not...|$|R

AARTO was promulgated in order to, amongst other things; assist with the streamlining of the traffic offence administration and the collection of payable fines for traffic infringements. Very little has been written with regard to the implications of AARTO on the employment relationship. The purpose of this dissertation is to unpack the mechanics of AARTO, and further to provide the writer’s view on its impact, problems and possible solutions, of the employment relationship within the South African Labour law framework. The writer will attempt to reconcile the Labour Relations Act and AARTO insofar as it impacts on the employment relationship, more especially the termination thereof. Writer will set out the provisions of AARTO and the sections pertaining to the allocation of demerit points on an <b>individual</b> driver’s <b>licence.</b> Unfortunately for the sake of completeness the writer will deal with the majority of sections in AARTO to provide {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms envisaged by the Act to bring about the demerit points.

40|$|According to {{a survey}} carried out in Ireland among the {{environment}} departments of all Local Authorities, closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems are {{the most widely used}} technology for monitoring and prosecuting illegal environmental activities. Despite the fact that new technologies have been proposed in recent years, CCTV remains the preferred option. However, commercial CCTV systems are not specifically designed to tackle environmental enforcement issues. From the survey analysis the main limitations of commercial CCTV equipment deployed to date for environmental enforcement are: night time monitoring, monitoring of high risk or hostile areas, and battery powered CCTV systems for short term or remote deployments. The objective for the research was to identify solutions to the CCTV issues raised in the survey. It focused on the adaptation, installation and testing of commercial CCTV equipment for environmental enforcement scenarios. For each scenario several technologies with different configurations were evaluated. Equipment employed in this work included: digital video cameras, infra red illuminators, analogue cameras with long range optical zoom and low power consumption cameras. The effectiveness of each solution was assessed on its ability to detect and record with accuracy <b>individuals,</b> or vehicle <b>licence</b> plates, and the offences committed in a cost effective manner. In conclusion, this research provided solutions for the three CCTV challenges raised in the survey by Irish Local Authorities. Consequently, new approaches to environmental monitoring are available to Local Authorities for future environmental enforcement in Ireland...|$|R
40|$|Both {{the rapid}} speed {{of change and}} the changes in society due to the {{information}} revolution in general, poses special challenges for forecasting the future of e-business and assessing its impacts. The traditional processes of collecting information over time, describing a base case and projecting of future trends, or assessing change scenarios, encounters problems in all stages. These challenges apply to studies of impacts on the economy in general but are greater in studies of impacts in specific industries, such as transport. More detailed information is required and more detailed outputs are expected. Almost always such studies are looking for sufficiently detailed insights on future conditions to allow plans {{to be put in}} place. This requires predictions to be linked closely to time frames and specifics of localities. Network data adds connectivity, type of link and link capacity information to geographic mapping data of roads and railway lines. The road authorities in each state hold complete network data for their states often augmented by road condition data. Linking capacity and linking condition may be particularly relevant to assessment of the future ability of the road or rail system to accommodate future e-commerce. This might be applied to consideration of capacity of local roads for urban freight in cities or to measure highway or railway capacity for inter-urban freight movements. In common with workplace and industrial locations, commodity flows are likely to change with a rise in e-commerce. It is possible these changes may occur within a five-year framework. Examples of available data for tracking activities, which may change rapidly within a five- year period, have been divided for convenience into those relating to personal activity and those relating to business activity. Both types of data are discussed in section three of this Working Paper. Vehicle registration and licensing databases show locations and numbers of registered vehicle types by location. While they provide information on the passenger fleet they are of particular value in the e-business context in tracking changes in numbers and types of commercial vehicle and also in holders of commercial vehicle <b>licences.</b> <b>Individual</b> states and territories hold these databases. In addition, the ABS also collects the data to report on an Australia wide basis. Consideration of changes in the urban freight task is particularly important in estimating the impacts of e-business on the road system and vice versa. For example, will e-commerce add to congestion and equally what will be the impacts of congestion on e-commerce? Until recently transport planners concentrated on commuter travel. Estimates of future demands were modelled on passenger transport needs and the extra demands of freight were simply ‘loaded onto the network’...|$|R
40|$|German arms export {{policies}} {{have proved to}} be an eternally emotive issue in political and social debate. Although the controversy does not, in the long run, illuminate, the vehemence with which it is time and again conducted indicates that all is not well. In a democracy based on the rule of law, should we not be able to assume that the apparent collisions between accepted norms and vested interests are governed by the law in a way that political and administrative actions do not produce any fundamental contradictions in terms? To meet this objective, the law must be universally valid and achievable, to ensure the maintenance of peace under the law. In reality, a glance at the system of legal norms and procedures that shape current German arms export politics leaves an impression of “extraordinary complexity” and reflects “an extremely unclear and interlocked structure of legal rulings with numerous origins” candidly admits a legal commentator. This judgement is confirmed when these legal foundations, as they appear in their German sources, are considered {{in the context of the}} European Union and in view of the general global situation. Therefore, it is not surprising that the German political and administrative handling of arms exports gets tangled in inconsistencies that feed the controversy. In view of this awkwardness, the situation should be reviewed from the perspective that maintenance of the peace nationally also demonstrates the state’s ability to maintain peace at an international level, particularly if that state is a democracy. Difficulties already start with the effort to define, in detail, what is meant by the phrase “arms exports. ” Currently, a distinction is drawn between the cross-border transfer of arms, defence equipment, goods that promote war and dual-use goods. Most recently, the term “military equipment” has been used to summarise all these different categories of items. As a consequence, the Arms Control Law (Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz) and the law ruling commercial relations with other states (Law for Foreign Trade, Außenwirtschaftsgesetz), including their detailed administrative regulations, apply. However, intervention is repeatedly required to ensure harmony between administrative acts and the changing parameters of political actions. This is demonstrated by the various editions of the “Principles of Government Policy in Relation to Arms Export,” the most recent of which was published in January 2000. German law only applies, however, where it has not been superseded or complemented by EU regulations. This is true for the treatment of dual-use goods and for the growing consolidation of cooperation in arms manufacture within Europe. While decisions about arms export issues in the context of the EU still fall under the ultimate sovereignty of individual states, the EU member states agreed, in 1998, to a code of conduct concerning arms transfers. This agreement contains criteria to be applied to the decision making process of the individual member states. Special emphasis is given to the human rights standards, social and economic aspects of development and the regional and domestic stability of the receiver states. Also, the code of conduct commits EU member states to present a report annually on the previous year’s arms export activities to the European parliament and requires the member states to provide each other with information about their arms trade. II The EU code of conduct incorporates aims, formulated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the beginning of the nineties, that also relate to the adjustment of export policies of Central and Eastern European states. The idea of agreeing to a code of conduct, when legally binding arrangements do not seem possible, also formed the basis of an agreement between the EU and the USA in December 2000, the goal of which was the realisation of a global code of conduct. In this context, the EU and the USA can make reference to similar initiatives of other regional alliances, in particular the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and some groups of states in South Asia. All these initiates demonstrate that the international arms trade has become part of arms control politics. In addition to being influenced by regulations within individual states and newly agreed political understandings, arms export politics takes into consideration informal consultation and coordination mechanisms, which are treated as “gentlemen’s agreements”. The best known of these is the 1994 / 5 ”Wassenar Arrangement,” which followed the earlier Coordination Committee for Multilateral Exports Controls (COCOM). It aims to regulate the export of conventional arms and equipment, sensitive dual-use goods and plant. The arrangement has more than thirty participant states, including Russia and other states that formerly belonged to the Warsaw Pact. Despite the informal nature of this agreement, the resulting regime has a strong influence on national and European export controls. The legal and political situation can, thus, be summarised as consisting of a “hard” core surrounded by “soft” regulations, instructions and procedures that together form the basis of decisions and are open to interpretation. Decisions are often made in an inconsistent manner, as political recommendations are influenced by conflicting economic and technological interests, not to mention cases of political opportunism with regard to the granting or refusal of <b>individual</b> arms export <b>licences.</b> Different levels of law, national, international and trans-national, are entwined, often leaving legislative loopholes and creating contradictions in terms. While lawyers might be used to dealing with different levels of law, politicians and the public find it much more difficult to cope with the resulting dilemmas. Exaggeratedly, the situation in Germany can be characterised as follows: 1. the prohibition versus the allowance of cross-border trade in defence equipment; 2. qualitative criteria for the decision making process versus lists of countries; 3. national versus international or trans-national restrictions; 4. governmental agreements versus cooperation in the private sector; 5. secrecy versus transparency. The current state of affairs casts doubt on whether the general validity, clarity and enactment of present laws can be sufficiently guaranteed. This rocks the foundations of the legitimacy and legality of arms export politics – a situation or constellation that calls for a fundamental examination and reorientation of arms export politics, down to its very roots. III The plea for a revision of the foundations of the arms export politics and for a search for alternatives, aims to reconcile the legal norms and procedures with the political requirements and central trends of the social debate, which could remedy the deficits that can, in the long run, damage a democracy based on the rule of law. This should also include changes in the global arms market that have occurred in the meantime. This market can be divided into different segments: The first segment relates to the predominantly uncontrolled distribution of the means of mass destruction, in the form of a multitude of so-called small arms. These can be characterised as being easy to transport, easy to handle without previous knowledge, low cost and long-lived. They are produced in many places and are available on open, grey and black markets. The second segment relates to the transfer of technologically advanced and very expensive weapons systems, the purchase and deployment of which is only sensible in cooperation with modern, highly qualified forces. In between these two segments exists a third segment that relates to the trade of weapons and defence equipment that are considered outdated by industrial states but which still have high value as status symbols or as part of the military politics of less demanding prospective buyers. A German contribution to the first segment of the global arms market exists in form of German licences, which are openly used to produce and distribute weapons in an uncontrolled way, not to mention the transfer of plant of German origin that can be used to produce those weapons or their ammunition. Conventional legal instruments have become virtually ineffective for monitoring, as this segment is becoming more and more mixed up with cross-border criminal acts, international drugs trade and money laundering. Therefore, national as well as international measures are required to put an end to illegal deals. Also, in order to decrease demand for these weapons, it is imperative to strengthen international criminal law, cooperation between police and customs and initiatives in development policy regarding violent conflict-zones in the Third World. As a consequence of the increasing integration of the foreign and security policies of the European Union, of the restructuring of the armed forces in many countries and the increasing cooperation or even merger of European defence industries, it will not be possible to control the second and third segment except in a European context. The six most important arms producing states in the European Union settled on a skeleton agreement in July 2000 that creates the basic conditions for such a European endeavour. It would be anachronistic if arms export politics continued as a remnant of national sovereignty, rather than becoming a component of this political and economical process. It would be consistent to restrict the transfer of weapons and defence equipment to the circle of states that are part of these developments. Also, the norms and qualitative criteria that are valid here should govern decisions about transfer of surplus weapons to countries that are not part of military or security alliances. If it were possible to reconcile the procedures involved in political direction setting with decisions about arms export, then the law would no longer have to serve as workshop, repairing the faults caused by political omissions and failures. IV Although all options so far discussed assume that some form of arms export will continue to be carried out, the alternative of living without such deals should also be considered. This would place considerable emphasis on the proclaimed aim of a democracy to be recognised as a ‘civil power’ (Zivilmacht), including in their behaviour to other states. However, the most important suppliers of arms are still democracies that provide arms to the rest of the world. Without the supply of weapons and other defence equipment, the intensity with which brute force is used in the violent conflicts in which democracies are involved, would decrease. Thus, the costs of such a sudden change in policy need to be weighed against the burdens imposed by the current situation. This comparison might also reveal connections that would cast a different light on the pros and cons of arms transfer and might even convince current advocates of arms trade. One example of such a process is the successful campaign, 150 years ago, for the abolition of slavery. If democracy, law and peace are to go hand in hand, then the rejection of arms export is a good example to test this cause and a global advertisement for it...|$|R
