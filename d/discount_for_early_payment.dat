50|$|An {{example of}} a common payment term is Net 30 days, which means that payment is due {{at the end of}} 30 days from the date of invoice. The debtor is free to pay before the due date; {{businesses}} can offer a <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> <b>early</b> <b>payment.</b> Other common payment terms include Net 45, Net 60 and 30 days end of month. The creditor may be able to charge late fees or interest if the amount is not paid by the due date.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} why dynamic {{discounting}} is beneficial to buyers is as follows. If a buyer receives a 2 per cent <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> of an invoice—for example paying a 30-day-net invoice after 10 days. Therefore, instead of earning interest on the cash held in an account, it is “invested” for 20 days to get a 2 per cent return, This represents the equivalent of an over 36 per cent annual return on capital. While the early payment of the invoice {{would lead to a}} reduction in interest on the cash, the return for early payment far outweighs the loss of interest. That early payment may also be very valuable to the supplier who values cash flow more than high margins.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and freely negotiable.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is intended to}} identify factors that affect the achievement of gross profit, ROI, and CFROI of each Operational Division and services rendered. Besides, the analysis is also done to identify how large is the opportunity cost that occur due to delay in receipt of trade receivables. Data collection for the research was done at PT TJE's Head Office between August and September 2004. Analysis techniques used are time series and cross section, whereas analysis tools used are gross profit, ROI, and CFROI. The analysis {{result is that the}} financial performance of Operational Division One and Three succeed to make the realization of gross profit was higher than target, but Operational Division Two and Four failed to realize gross profit as target due to inefficiency in performance of project. Operational Division Two and Three succeed in realizing higher ROI and CFROI than its investment cost but Operational Division One and Four failed to realize ROI and CFROI as target, due to failure to minimize project cost, that create inefficiency and less optimal utilization of investment from corporate. Construction service in Operational Division One and Three, maintenance service in Operational Division Two and Three, and EPC service in Operational Division One and Three produced higher gross profit than target. Construction service in Operational Division Two and Four, maintenance service in Operational Division One, and Fabrication service in Operational Division Four produced lower gross profit than target, since these divisions failed to minimize project cost that incurred. Construction service in Operational Division One, Two, and Three; Maintenance service in Operational Division Two and Three produced higher ROI and CFROI than targeted cost of capital. Construction service in Operational Division Four, Maintenance service in Operational Division One, EPC service in Operational Division One and Three, and Fabrication service in Operational Division Four produced lower ROI and CFROI than the investment cost, because the investment value from corporate was unable to utilize optimally. CFROI produced by the entire operational divisions were lower than ROI. The result suggested that maintain Operational Division Three, One and Two, by improving the efficiency of project cost, change management of Operational Division Four.

In contrast, this result does not hold for Black-owned firms. The neighborhood survey results suggest the idea of looking for ethnic differences in the effects of relationships at the national level as well. Although good supplier-level measures of relationships are not available in the NSSBF, we use census data to construct MSA-level measures of the prevalence of minority-owned businesses. We then explore how location in an MSA with a higher proportion of businesses of the same ethnicity is associated with the use of trade credit by minority owners relative to White-owned firms. We find that a higher MSA share for Hispanic-owned businesses is generally associated with a reduction in differences in the use of trade credit by Hispanic owners relative to White owners. No clear association is apparent between the MSA share for Black-owned businesses and their use of trade credit. Thus, the ethnic differences in the effects of relationships evident in the neighborhood surveys seem to be consistent with the results from the national surveySmall business; Trade; Credit...|$|R
50|$|The {{opportunity}} to earn <b>discounts</b> in exchange <b>for</b> <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> in business-to-business commerce {{has been limited}} historically by {{the length of time}} necessary for accounts payable's to receive and approve paper invoices. An invoice that takes 20 days to be approved, for example, cannot be paid in time to qualify <b>for</b> a <b>discount</b> available from a supplier for payment on day 10. With the advent of electronic invoicing and Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) automation enabled by the Internet, buying organizations are increasingly able to approve invoices faster and take advantage of available discounts. Dynamic discounting methods were first invented and patented by Xign Corporation in the early 2000s to help businesses take advantage of these trends and establish <b>early</b> <b>payment</b> terms with suppliers. Since then software enabling dynamic discounts has become a common feature of procure-to-pay automation products. More recently, dynamic discount methods are being implemented via auction sites that enable buyers and suppliers to negotiate payment terms and discounts across large amounts of their spend.|$|R
