The anodophilic biofilm that developed on the graphite tissue anode could detect acetate as the model AOC to concentrations as low as 5 [*]µM (120 [*]µg/L of AOC), which is sufficiently sensitive as an online biofouling risk sensor. Although the sensor was operated at a higher (+ 200 [*]±[*] 10 [*]mV) than the usual (- 300 [*]mV) anodic potential, the presence of oxygen completely suppressed the electrical signal. In order to overcome this outcompeting effect of oxygen over the anode as electron acceptor by the bacteria, hexacyanoferrate (HCF(III)) was found to enable the development of an adapted biofilm that transferred electrons to HCF(III) rather than oxygen. As the resultant of the reduced HCF(II) could readily transfer electrons to the anode while being re-oxidised to HCF(III), the marine MFC biosensor developed could be demonstrated to work in the presence of oxygen unlike traditional MFC. The possibility of operating the marine MFC in batch or continuous (<b>in-line)</b> <b>mode</b> has been explored by using coulombic or potentiometric interpretation of the signal. Biotechnol.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the possibility of}} using an <b>in-line</b> <b>mode</b> flocculation–ultrafiltration system for the purification of backwash water from flushing the beds of pressure filters used in the indoor swimming pool water treatment circulation. The effect of flocculation operational conditions (the flocculant dose in the range from 16 to 240 mg/dm 3 and the process temperature of 8 – 30 °C) on the transport-separation properties of ultrafiltration membranes has been examined. To establish the effectiveness of the conducted processes, the contaminant retention coefficients, among others, were determined (based on the measurements of turbidity and UV 254 ultraviolet absorbance). A significant influence of the flocculation process operational parameters on the performance of ultrafiltration was noted. With increasing flocculant dose, the efficiency of contaminant removal in the ultrafiltration process increased simultaneously. Moreover, the change in the temperature conditions of the flocculation process had a fundamental effect on the transport properties of the ultrafiltration membranes. The most advantageous temperature for conducting the processes was considered to be 21 °C. Under those conditions, all flocculant doses contributed to a significant improvement in the transport properties of the ultrafiltration membranes. High values of the contamination retention coefficients and the permeate volumetric flux were obtained already at a flocculant dose of 80, 160 and 240 mg/dm 3...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} is to adopt, apply and test developed in-house algorithms for volumetric breast reconstructions from projection images, obtained in in-line phase-contrast mode. Four angular sets, each consisting of 17 projection images obtained from four physical phantoms, were acquired at beamline ID 17, European Synchroton Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The tomosynthesis arc was ± 32 °. The physical phantoms differed in complexity of texture and introduced features of interest. Three of the used phantoms were in-house developed, and made of epoxy resin, polymethyl-methacrylate and paraffin wax, while the fourth phantom was the CIRS BR 3 D. The projection images had a pixel size of 47 μm × 47 μm. Tomosynthesis images were reconstructed with standard shift-and-add (SAA) and filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithms. It {{was found that the}} edge enhancement observed in planar x-ray images is preserved in tomosynthesis images from both phantoms with homogeneous and highly heterogeneous backgrounds. In case of BR 3 D, it was found that features not visible in the planar case were well outlined in the tomosynthesis slices. In addition, the edge enhancement index calculated for features of interest was found to be much higher in tomosynthesis images reconstructed with FBP than in planar images and tomosynthesis images reconstructed with SAA. The comparison between images reconstructed by the two reconstruction algorithms shows an advantage for the FBP method in terms of better edge enhancement.

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{of three}} low-mode number, flexible cylinders in uniform-flow is investigated to determine effects of structural mode shape on vortex-induced vibrations. Experiments are {{performed in a}} re-circulating flow channel and in a small flow visualization tank using object tracking and digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to measure the excitation of the cylinder, to estimate forces acting on the structure, and to observe {{the wake of the}} structure under the observed body motions. Previous research has focused on understanding the effect of in-line to cross-flow natural frequency ratio on the excitation of the structure in an attempt to model the excitation of multiple structural modes on long, flexible bodies. The current research investigates the impact of structural mode shape on this relationship by holding the in-line to cross-flow natural frequency constant and attempting to excite a specific structural mode shape. Understanding the effects of mode excitation will improve the ability to predict fatigue life in structures which may exhibit combined irregular and regular oscillations by understanding how mode shape affects the vibrating response. In this series of experiments, three cylinders are tested. The in-line to cross-flow natural frequency is kept constant with a ratio of 2 : 1, while the modes associated with these frequencies are varied: first mode inline to first mode cross-flow, second mode in-line to first mode cross-flow, and third mode in-line to first mode cross-flow. ^ It is found {{that it is difficult to}} isolate the effect of mode shape on the vibration of the structure as the cylinder can easily be excited with different combinations of modes. It is shown that for the low-mode number beams tested, there are three primary responses possible for the cylinder when trying to excite the first mode in the cross-flow direction and first mode in the in-line direction (cylinder 1), the first mode in the cross-flow direction and the second mode in the in-line direction (cylinder 2); and the first mode in the cross-flow direction and third mode in the in-line direction (cylinder 3). ^ Cylinder 1 response consists of an expected excitation of the first mode cross-flow with an excitation of the first mode frequency in in-line direction. Regular and periodic cylinder oscillations obtained along the length of the cylinder. Cylinder 2 response consists of an expected excitation of the first mode cross-flow with an excitation of the second mode frequency in in-line direction; however, the structural shape resembles the first mode shape. This response is attributed to the structural mode being an insufficient description of the phenomenon as the wake must be included as part of the mode shape. This response is characteristic of a figure eight response of the cylinder. In cylinder 3 experiments, two different responses as crescent and figure eight patterns were obtained. In this case, higher flow speeds could not be reached so third mode shape in the in-line direction could not be obtained. ^ The wake is observed using DPIV on a rigid cylinder with forced motions equivalent to the flexible body. A case of mode switching is also observed where the even <b>in-line</b> <b>mode</b> exhibits an excitation at twice the cross-flow frequency; however, the spatial mode shape in-line appears similar to the first structural mode shape. It is hypothesized that this situation is possible due to variation in the effective added mass along the length of the cylinder. Odd mode shapes in both in-line and cross-flow directions show similar motions to those observed for rigid cylinders. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of phycobiliproteins, e. g. blue C-phycocyanin, as natural water-soluble food colourants is emerging. The chromophore of these proteins comprises {{a number of}} tetrapyrroles (or phycocyanobilins), which have an extensive conjugated system, vulnerable to autoxidation. To assess the autoxidation products, a simplified model system was used in which the free tetrapyrrole biliverdin, instead of phycobiliprotein, was subjected to light-accelerated autoxidation. Degradation products of biliverdin were subsequently annotated by reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with a photo diode array and positive <b>mode</b> <b>in-line</b> electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. To facilitate the analysis of degradation products, autoxidation of the three methine bridges in biliverdin was mimicked in silico. It was found that both the peripheral and central methine bridges of biliverdin were susceptible to light-accelerated autoxidation. Scission products tentatively annotated with MS 2 and MS 3 were propionic acid-containing pyrroles. From this, it can be speculated that tetrapyrroles attached to phycobiliproteins are susceptible to autoxidative degradation...|$|R

40|$|A new {{fiber optic}} sensing {{technology}} for measuring in-cylinder pressure in automotive engines was investigated. The optic sensing element consists of two mirrors in an <b>in-line</b> single <b>mode</b> fiber that are separated by some distance. To withstand the harsh conditions inside an engine, the Fiber Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FFPI) element was coated with gold and copper. The metal-protected fiber sensor was embedded into a small cut in the metal casing of the spark plug. At first, the sensing element was dipped in liquid gold and cured. Then the gold-coated fiber sensor was electroplated with copper. Finally, the metal-coated fiber sensor was embedded in the spark plug. The spark-plug-embedded FFPI sensor was monitored using a signal conditioning unit. Field tests were carried out in a 3 -cylinder automotive engine with a piezoelectric pressure sensor as a reference transducer up to about 3500 rpm. The fiber optic sensor data generally matched those measured by the piezoelectric reference sensor. The use of a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) diode as a light source in an FFPI optic sensor system was investigated. Reflected light from the FFPI sensing element {{was used to measure}} the optical path difference. With a 1550 nm VCSEL as the light source in a 12 mm cavity length Fiber Fabry-Perot Interferometer, spectral characteristics were examined to determine the proper combination of dc bias current, modulation current amplitude and modulation frequency. Single VCSEL operation and regular fringe patterns were achieved. The laser tuning was - 41. 2 GHz/mA and was determined from measurements of the shift in the spectral peak of the VCSEL diode output as a function of dc bias current. By testing the fringe movement as the FFPI sensor was heated, the temperature tuning coefficient for the optical length was determined to be 11 x 10 - 6 ????C. The results of these experiments indicate that the use of VCSEL diode as a light source for the FFPI sensor offers a viable alternative to the use of Distributed Feedback (DFB) laser diodes for monitoring at a lower bias current and modulating current amplitude...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and Quality by Design (QbD) concepts by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the pharmaceutical industry is thriving towards improved process understanding. Subsequently, the pharmaceutical industry shifted {{the focus on the}} implementation of new technologies for real-time process control of various unit operations. Enhanced process understanding will result in a robust process and eventually enable quality by design into the product. Inline with this PAT concept of improving process understanding and enhancing manufacturing efficiency, the objectives of this research work were to introduce and implement novel technologies of dynamic image analysis (DIA). The novel DIA approaches would allow for real-time (on-line) particle size and shape monitoring in a pharmaceutical dry milling unit operation and subsequently flowability characterization (at-line) of the milled material for pharmaceutical powders and granules. For the first objective we employed a pilot-scale conical mill and investigated two DIA sensors, one as on-line mode and the other as <b>in-line</b> <b>mode,</b> for real-time particle size and shape monitoring. We selected different pharmaceutical excipients and placebo granulates, spanning a wide range of particle characteristics, for milling. Various mill parameters such as feeder speed, impeller speed, and screen sizes were considered. The particle size distribution results obtained from both the on-line and in-line modes were compared with a commercially available DIA instrument, which served as an at-line reference. Additionally, the data was also compared with the traditional sieve analysis. The results from the on-line, in-line and at-line DIA measurement modes showed similar particle size distributions for the various materials studied. However, few differences among the different DIA modes were observed that were mainly attributed to sampling and particle dispersion. A high correlation of 0. 975 (p< 0. 001) was observed between on-line d 50 and at-line d 50 when compared to 0. 917 (p< 0. 001) between in-line d 50 and at-line d 50. Finally, the on-line sensor was chosen as it provided robust results. A novel concept of time evolving size and shape analysis (TESSA) was successfully proposed {{for the first time in}} dry milling. The TESSA approach was found to be useful in detecting changes in milling conditions including the successful detection of a damaged screen when intentionally introduced in the milling process. In the second objective we introduced a modern instrument, which combines powder avalanching with DIA to enable a comprehensive understanding of the flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powder formulations. The flow characterization of such formulations is essential as they can pose a challenge for upstream solid dosage manufacturing such as tabletting (die filling) and capsulation (weight variation). A commercial powder avalanching instrument existed earlier, but it lacked dynamic image analysis and further provided very few avalanching parameters such as mean time to avalanche and scatter values. The novel instrument used in this study provides image analysis of the motion of a powder inside a rotating drum and results in several parameters associated with powder avalanching such as avalanche time, avalanche angle, and avalanche power in addition to several other parameters. We initially tested the suitability of this modern instrument for flow characterization of binary blends, comprising of a coarse excipient and fine drug particles, and further introduced the concept of critical flow concentrations (CFCs). At least three drug concentrations were identified for which the flow behaviour, of the binary blends, essentially changed. Accordingly, different flow regions were identified, which were explained on the basis of changed particle packing configurations. A theoretical model successfully provided a first estimate of the initial two CFCs. The novel avalanche testing instrument used in this work provided complementary information to conventional flowability methodologies such as flow through an orifice. A thorough assessment of pharmaceutical blends is needed to avoid CFCs in view of a robust formulation development and hence with respect to building quality into the design of the solid dosage forms. Later, we used the powder avalanching instrument for characterizing the flow behaviour of the milled materials produced from the conical mill. In the third objective we implemented the on-line DIA sensor in the conical mill and further tested the feasibility of the avalanching instrument as a potential at-line PAT tool for powder flow characterization. We conducted a response surface design in combination with robustness testing (Taguchi design). Both of these designs employed the conical mill, together with the on-line DIA sensor and the powder avalanching instrument. The mill process parameters, namely impeller speed and screen sizes significantly affected the particle size distribution and flow rate of the milled placebo granules. Feeder speed did not affect the particle size, but displayed a statistically significant influence on the flow responses. Robustness testing was able to capture the effect of assigned noise factors (different placebo lots and temperature conditions) on the responses and showed clear differences between different lots of the placebo granulates in addition to temperature-dependent changes in flow behaviour. Eventually, the powder avalanching instrument was proved to be a successful at-line PAT tool. The dynamic image analysis PAT tools investigated in this research work provided a novel source of understanding the particle characteristics (size and shape) and flow behaviour of pharmaceutical powders and dry milled granules. Adequate characterization of particle size as well as shape and flowability is essential for upstream solid dosage form manufacturing. Thus, on-line particle size monitoring and at-line flowability characterization using the presented novel DIA techniques together, as complementary process analytical tools, provides valuable information for industrial characterization of pharmaceutical dry particulate systems, namely powders and granules...|$|E
40|$|Since CE was {{developed}} {{in the beginning of the}} 80 s with significant advantage over slab gel electrophoresis, it has been actively applied in DNA sequencing with capillary array electrophoresis. With the development of different separation modes of CE, this technique has been used as an alternative tool for HPLC in the analytical field due to its high efficiency, high speed and low cost. The applications include the analysis of charged analytes, inorganic ions, peptides and proteins. The simple setup of CE makes it easy to couple with various detectors including UV, fluorescence and MS. CE with UV detection has been used in routine quality control of biopharmaceutical products in the pharmaceutical industry. The highly sensitive fluorescence detection allows to detect low level analytes in body fluids. The successful coupling of CE and MS extends the potential of CE to more profoundly understand human threatening diseases. As we all know, enzymes are not only major drug targets in drug discovery processes in the pharmaceutical industry, but also play an important role in clinical research as well as in diagnosis. Therefore measurement of enzymatic activity is clearly important for future diagnostics and for the development of therapeutic products. CE offers unique advantages in enzyme assay and inhibitor screening due to its short analysis time, low reagent cost and minimal sample requirement. The capillary can not only serve as a separation tool, but also as a reaction vessel. The in-capillary reaction of enzyme and substrate can be triggered either by electrophoresis or pressure which is referred to as electrophoretically mediated microanalysis (EMMA) and pressure mediated microanalysis (PMMA), respectively. The sample throughput could be greatly enhanced by using a capillary array format for in-capillary based enzyme assay. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been considered as prognostic factors in various types of cancer as well as promising targets for cancer therapy. Therefore, the development of an assay method is extremely important for MMP activity and for its inhibitor screening. Firstly, EMMA combined with fluorescence detection {{was developed}} for the assay of MMP- 2 / 9 activity and the screening of their inhibitors. A fluorogenic substrate was used to measure the increase in fluorescence after hydrolysis by MMP. A short-end injection was employed to shorten the analysis time. The reactants were injected in the sequence enzyme, substrate with or without inhibitor and enzyme from the outlet of the capillary. They were mixed by switching the polarity every 5 s for in total 20 s. The whole in-line reaction, separation and quantification were achieved in about 1 min. The developed EMMA based approach was applied to estimate the inhibitory mechanism and to determine the IC 50 values for two natural inhibitors, namely epigallocatechin gallate and oleic acid. A few other natural compounds such as resveratrol, quercetin, caffeic acid, as well as glucosamineand doxycycline were also tested for their inhibitory potency. The Km and IC 50 values obtained were comparable with those obtained by off-line enzyme assay. The ranking order for inhibition potency of natural products was consistent with a parallel off-line study. CE-MS has been considered as a unique tool for microscale enzyme assay and inhibitor screening. In this part of work, MMP- 9 was selected as target enzyme due to its important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. In order to define the optimal MS parameters, a two level half fraction factorial experimental design was performed. A background electrolyte consisting of 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6. 8) and a sheath liquid of water-methanol (50 : 50, v/v) containing 0. 05 % formic acid at a flow rate of 4 &# 956;L/min were selected. This system was operated in the positive ion mode with a detection limit of 10 nM for the MMP reaction product and provided 60 fold enhancement of sensitivity by using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) detection compared with MS full scan mode, which significantly increased the detectability of the system and therefore reduced the enzyme reaction time in both off-line and <b>in-line</b> <b>mode.</b> In combination with powerful SRM detection, EMMA was achieved in a single electrophoretic step by integrating in-line mixing, reaction and separation without zero potential amplification. The proposed pressure assisted EMMA approach decreased the analysis time around 2 fold without losing resolution by applying 0. 5 psi pressure at the capillary inlet during the electrophoretic separation. Both EMMA and PMMA with MS detection were investigated for MMP inhibitor screening. Good repeatability (RSD of peak area and migration time were less than 5. 0 %) and linearity (R 2 > 0. 996) were obtained for both in-capillary approaches. Several tetracycline antibiotics and natural products were selected to test the system. The results indicated an agreement on the ranking of inhibitory potency for both in-capillary approaches. EMMA/MS allows screening of MMP inhibitors using relatively low drug concentration (10 &# 956;M) by premixing of enzyme and inhibitor. PMMA/MS is expected to be applied as a universal tool for enzyme inhibitor screening with automation and miniaturization. Analysis of nitrite and nitrate, the indicator of nitric oxide (NO) generation in vivo, provides a useful tool to study NO synthesis in vivo. A simple method for simultaneous determination of nitrite and nitrate in human plasma was developed using CZE with minimal sample preparation. Field amplified sample stacking (FASS) was used to achieve submicromolar detection by dilution of the plasma sample with deionized water. In CZE, the separation of nitrite and nitrate was achieved within 10 min without adding EOF modifier. The optimal condition was achieved with 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 9. 3. The 9 -fold diluted plasma samples were injected hydrodynamically for 40 s into a 60 cm × 75 &# 956;m i. d. uncoated fused-silica capillary. The separation voltage was 20 kV (negative potential) and UV detection was performed at 214 nm. The linearity curves for nitrite and nitrate were obtained with the standard addition method. The estimated LODs for nitrite and nitrate in 9 -fold diluted plasma sample were 0. 05 and 0. 07 &# 956;M, respectively. The LODs for nitrite and nitrate in original plasma samples were 0. 45 and 0. 63 &# 956;M. The intra- and inter-day precision for both analytes were less than 2. 6 % and the recovery ranged between 92. 3 and 113. 3 %. It was found that nitrite was more stable than nitrate in the prepared plasma sample. This proposed method was applied to a number of human plasma samples and the measured nitrite and nitrate concentrations in human plasma were consistent with the literature ranges. In order to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of nitrite determination, a fast and sensitive fluorometric CE method was developed for the determination of nitrite in human plasma through its derivatization with 2, 3 -diaminonaphthalene (DAN). Nitrite in human plasma was easily reacted with DAN under acid conditions to yield the highly fluorescent 2, 3 -naphthotriazole (NAT). Fluorescence detection was optimized to achieve subnanomolar detection which allows a direct analysis of plasma samples without using sample stacking. Acetonitrile was used to remove the protein. Short-end injection and a high voltage (- 30 kV) were applied to shorten the analysis time. A good separation was achieved with 20 mM borate buffer at pH 9. 23. The separation of NAT was obtained within 1. 4 min. The deproteinized plasma sample was injected at - 50 mbar for 5 s into a 60 cm × 75 &# 956;m i. d. uncoated fused-silica capillary. The excitation wavelength was selected with a broad-band filter (240 - 400 nm), and the emitted light was measured at 418 nm by use of a cutoff filter. A good linearity (R 2 = 0. 9975) was obtained in the range from 2 to 500 nM. The detection limit of nitrite was 0. 6 nM in original plasma samples, which is 750 times lower than the CE-UV method mentioned above. The developed fluorometric CE method offers the advantages of a more simple system and lower cost compared with the current fluorometric HPLC methods, without losing sensitivity. The mean nitrite concentration detected in human plasma by this method was consistent with the most frequently reported values from 100 to 200 nM. Interestingly, it is well known that nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signal molecule in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and an increased NO level can inhibit platelet aggregation. It is also known that the plasma MMP- 9 level has been associated with CVD. It is reported that an inverse relationship exists between NO and MMP- 9 in healthy subjects. It is also found that NO down regulates MMP- 9 expression. Due to the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, NO can be produced from dietary nitrate which is particularly abundant in vegetables like beetroot. The NO level can be determined by its markers namely nitrite and nitrate concentration. Therefore, in this study, the effect of increased NO concentrationin the body on plasma MMP- 9 was investigated in subjects taking beetroot juice compared with taking a placebo drink. The results revealed a 3. 5 fold increase of plasma nitrate and 40 % increase of nitrite levels in subjects receiving beetroot juice after 6 days compared with subjects taking placebo. The corresponding plasma MMP- 9 level in each subject was quantitatively measured by ELISA based fluorometry and CE/MS methods. The inhibitory effect of increasing NO concentration on plasma MMP- 9 was observed in four of the eight subjects. The results indicated that short-term dietary nitrate supplementation is associated with a decrease in plasma MMP- 9 concentrations in some of the healthy men. status: publishe...|$|E

(2) The middleware service will support a variety of image compression modes. Currently, many of the network adaptation protocols for video have been developed with DCT-based compression algorithms like H. 261, MPEG- 1, or MPEG- 2 in mind. It is expected that with advanced scientific computing applications that the lossy compression of the image data will be unacceptable in certain instances. The middleware service will support several <b>in-line</b> lossless compression <b>modes</b> for error-sensitive scientific visualization data. (3) The middleware service will support {{two different types of}} streaming video modes: one for interactive collaboration of scientists and a stored video streaming mode for viewing prerecorded animations. The use of two different streaming types will allow the quality of the video delivered to the user to be maximized. Most importantly, this service will happen transparently to the user (with some basic controls exported to the user for domain specific tweaking). In the spirit of layered network protocols (like ISO and TCP/IP), application writers should not have to know a large amount about lower level network details. Currently, many example video streaming players have their congestion management techniques tightly integrated into the video player itself and are, for the most part, ''one-off'' applications. As more networked multimedia and video applications are written in the future, a larger percentage of these programmers and scientist will most likely know little about the underlying networking layer. By providing a simple, powerful, and semi-transparent middleware layer, the successful completion of this project will help serve as a catalyst to support future video-based applications, particularly those of advanced scientific computing applications...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{research}} on amorphous and crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is described. Probably {{the most important}} feature of SHJ solar cells is a thin intrinsic amorphous silicion (a‑Si:H) layer that is deposited before depositing the doped emitter and back surface field. The passivation properties of such intrinsic layers made by three different chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques have been investigated. For layers deposited at 130 °C, all techniques show a strong reduction in surface recombination velocity (SRV) after annealing. Modelling indicates that dangling bond saturation by atomic hydrogen is the predominant mechanism. We obtain outstanding carrier lifetimes of 10. 3 ms, corresponding to SRVs of 0. 56 cm/s. For a‑Si:H films made at 250 °C, an as-deposited minority carrier lifetime of 2. 0 ms is observed. In contrast to a‑Si:H films fabricated at 130 °C, however, no change in passivation quality upon thermal annealing is observed. These films were fabricated {{for the first time}} using a continuous <b>in-line</b> HWCVD <b>mode.</b> Wafer cleaning before a‑Si:H deposition is a crucial step for c‑Si surface passivation. We tested the influence of an atomic hydrogen treatment before a‑Si:H deposition on the c‑Si surface. The treatments were performed in a new virgin chamber to exclude Si deposition from the chamber walls. Subsequently, we deposited a-Si:H layers onto the c-Si wafers and measured the lifetime for different H treatment times. We found that increasing hydrogen treatment times led to lower effective lifetimes. Modelling of the measured minority carrier lifetime data shows that the decreased passivation quality is caused by an increased defect density at the amorphous-crystalline interface. Furtheremore, the passivation of different a‑Si:H containing layers have been tested. For intrinsic films and intrinsic/n-type stacks, an improvement in passivation up to 255 °C and 270 °C is observed. This improvement is attributed to dangling bond saturation by H, whereas the decrease at higher temperatures is caused by H effusion. For intrinsic/n-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a record minority carrier lifetime of 13. 3 ms is obtained. In contrast, for intrinsic/p-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a deterioration in passivation is observed over the whole temperature range, due to the asymmetric Fermi-level dependent defect formation enthalpy in n- and p-type a‑Si:H. Comparing the lifetime values and trends for the different layer stacks to the performance of the corresponding cells, it is observed that the intrinsic/p-layer stack is limiting device performance. Based on these findings, the solar cells were prepared in a modified order, reaching an efficiency of 16. 7 % (VOC = 681 mV), versus 15. 8 % (VOC = 659 mV) in the ‘standard’ order. Finally, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers are studied for application into solar cells. It is observed that both types of TCO deposition have no significant influence on the passivation properties of standard a‑Si:H layer stacks forming the emitter structure in the used SHJ cells. On flat wafers, a conversion efficiency of 16. 7 % has been obtained when ITO is used as TCO, versus an efficiency of 16. 3 % for ZnO:Al; slightly lower due to increased electrical losses...|$|R
