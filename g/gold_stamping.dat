"And {{she could}} wear it thus," [...] he said, {{speaking}} to himself--"could wear {{it in her}} very bosom--could wear it next to her heart--even when---- But complain avails not," [...] he said, dashing from his eye the tear which had gathered in it, and resuming the stern composure of his manner. He strode to the chimney, and threw into the fire the paper and piece of <b>gold,</b> <b>stamping</b> upon the coals {{with the heel of}} his boot, as if to ensure their destruction. [...] "I will be no longer," [...] he then said, [...] "an intruder here. Your evil wishes, and your worse offices, Lady Ashton, I will only return by hoping these will be your last machinations against your daughter's honour and happiness. And to you, madam," [...] he said, addressing Lucy, [...] "I have nothing farther to say, except to pray to God that you may not become a world's wonder for this act of wilful and deliberate perjury."

5000|$|She {{began her}} career as a {{designer}} in the 1880s, working initially for A.C. McClurg and later for other publishers as well. She designed more than 270 book covers and book bindings, about half of which were for Scribner’s. She worked in the Art Nouveau style and favored plant-related motifs, bold colors, <b>gold</b> <b>stamping,</b> and often slightly asymmetrical designs—an unusual combination that helped to distinguish her among her peers. Authors for whom she designed several covers include Frances Hodgson Burnett, Florence L. Barclay, George Washington Cable, Charles Dickens, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Robert Louis Stevenson, Henry van Dyke, and Myrtle Reed. She has been called [...] "the most productive and accomplished American book designer of the 1890s and early 1900s", and her work is often compared to that of her contemporary Alice Cordelia Morse.|$|E
50|$|Metalworking {{picked up}} {{quickly in the}} Late Chimú periods. Some Chimú {{artisans}} worked in metal workshops divided into sections for each specialized treatment of metals: plating, <b>gold,</b> <b>stamping,</b> lost-wax, pearl, the watermark, and embossing wooden molds. These techniques produced large variety of objects, such as cups, knives, containers, figurines, bracelets, pins, crowns, etc. They used arsenic to harden the metals after they were cast. Large-scale smelting {{took place in a}} cluster of workshops at Cerro de los Cemetarios. The process starts with ore extracted from mines or a river, which is heated to very high temperatures and then cooled. The result is a group of prills (small round sections of copper, for example) in a mass of slag (other materials which are not useful for metallurgy). The prills are then extracted by crushing the slag, and then melted together to form ingots, which were fashioned into various items.|$|E
5000|$|The {{works in}} an album, {{typically}} of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an Islamic book-cover {{that might be}} highly decorated with lacquered paint, <b>gold</b> <b>stamping</b> on leather, or other techniques. Other muraqqa might be bound in a special concertina-like form. Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler. [...] Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show {{the development of a}} style. The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced. The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers. For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the [...] "bread and butter" [...] source of income, using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or ghazal lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the Qur'an, perhaps given the place of honour {{at the start of the}} album. Album pages often have areas of decorated illumination (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.|$|E
