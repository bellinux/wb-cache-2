500|$|According to Steven Curtis Chapman, {{the idea}} for [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] {{came out of a}} song he had written called [...] "Find Me", which did not end up being {{included}} on This Moment.

500|$|In February 2014, Paul {{joined the}} Tea Party-affiliated {{conservative}} advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit {{charging that the}} federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata {{is a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, [...] "I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to a judge, have an individual's name and [...] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says." [...] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political [...] "stunt". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use. On the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Drawing from synth-pop music, [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{incorporates}} minimalist production elements. with styles commonly seen in {{new wave}} music. Distinguished as the [...] "poppiest" [...] track from Night Time, My Time, its lyrics see Ferreira accepting that her behavior {{contributes to the}} public image she is given by the media; during the chorus, she states [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> realize I blame myself for my reputation." [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] was assumed to {{have been inspired by}} the [...] "anthemic pop fizz" [...] from her breakthrough single [...] "Everything Is Embarrassing" [...] from her second extended play Ghost (2012). Jenn Pelly from Pitchfork Media implied that [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] referenced the struggles Ferreira faced while creating her long-delayed debut studio album; Pelly suggested that the track was inspired by her frequent conflicts with her record label during production of the project, and added that it [...] "lays out the emotional core" [...] of her process. Jillian Mapes from the same publication assumed that Ferreira crafted the song in response to being labeled a [...] "socialite [...] Forever 21 model" [...] and receiving criticism after her drug arrest in September 2013, which she expected would highlight that her side projects [...] "have {{nothing to do with the}} kind of songs Ferreira writes these days". [...] "I Blame Myself", in addition to the tracks [...] "24 Hours" [...] and [...] "Love in Stereo", blend [...] "tenderized vocal hooks [...] chiming synth melodies", which reminded Lauren Martin from Fact of 1980s music. With his similar observation, Dan Keenan from Impact noted that the [...] "chiming synths" [...] that Martin recognized developed into the [...] "undeniably cathartic" [...] refrain.|$|E

500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech.

2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E

They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum.
