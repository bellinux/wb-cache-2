50|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s, {{telephones}} were redesigned {{with the numbers}} and letters on a ring outside the <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> to provide better visibility.|$|E
50|$|By 1955, all color 500s were {{produced}} with clear finger wheels, while black sets retained the metal <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> until about 1964, {{when a new}} dial design was released.|$|E
50|$|All early {{telephone}} sets had dials {{with metal}} <b>finger</b> <b>wheels,</b> while starting in 1941 the colored thermoplastic units featured clear plastic <b>finger</b> <b>wheels.</b> Dial number plates {{were made from}} steel with a white vitreous enamel face. Black 302 telephone sets were equipped from the factory with straight brown textile-covered cords until 1952, when synthetic rubber (Neoprene) jacketed cords became standard equipment. Optional retractile coiled cords were available both in textile and rubber jackets since the early 1940s.|$|R

50|$|The iPod {{click wheel}} is the {{navigation}} component of several iPod models. It uses {{a combination of}} touch technology and traditional buttons, involving the technology of capacitive sensing, which senses the capacitance of the user's <b>fingers.</b> The <b>wheel</b> allows a user to find music, videos, photos and play games on the device. The wheel is flush {{on the face of}} the iPod and is located below the screen.|$|R
50|$|On {{the rotary}} dial, the digits are {{arranged}} in a circular layout so that a <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> may be rotated with one finger from the position of each digit to a fixed stop position, implemented by the finger stop, which is a mechanical barrier to prevent further rotation.|$|E
50|$|The {{most complex}} {{internal}} part was the rotary dial mechanism, an assembly of gears, cams, springs, and electrical contacts which mechanically generated a timed train of line loop-break pulses when the dial <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> was released after rotation. During {{the period of}} dial rotation, the receiver was shunted to avoid hearing the dialing pulses.|$|E
50|$|The {{first patent}} for a rotary dial was granted to Almon Brown Strowger (November 29, 1892) as , but the {{commonly}} known form with {{holes in the}} <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> was not introduced until ca. 1904. While used in telephone systems of the independent telephone companies, rotary dial service in the Bell System in the United States was not common until {{the introduction of the}} Western Electric model 50AL in 1919.|$|E
60|$|Brooding {{over this}} plan, {{resolved}} when the hour should come, to propose, and insist upon its accomplishment, secure of his consent, {{the heart of}} Perdita was lightened, or rather exalted. Her cheek was flushed by the expectation of struggle; her eyes sparkled {{with the hope of}} triumph. Having cast her fate upon a die, and feeling secure of winning, she, whom I have named as bearing the stamp of queen of nations on her noble brow, now rose superior to humanity, and seemed in calm power, to arrest with her <b>finger,</b> the <b>wheel</b> of destiny. She had never before looked so supremely lovely.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} U.K. on Decca credited Faithfull as a co-writer, {{but when}} London Records issued the single was issued in the U.S., {{her name was}} omitted, as {{it was from the}} credit on 'Sticky Fingers'. [...] After a legal battle Faithfull retained her rights as a co-author, acknowledged by the 1994 Virgin Records reissue of the Stones' album catalogue from Sticky <b>Fingers</b> through Steel <b>Wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|A rotary dial {{typically}} {{features a}} circular construction. The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism {{is driven by}} the <b>finger</b> <b>wheel,</b> a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference. The <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate, or number plate below, either in whole, or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole. The faceplate is printed with numbers, and sometimes letters, corresponding to each finger hole. The 1 is normally set at approximately 60 degrees clockwise from the uppermost point of the dial, or approximately at the 2 o'clock position, and then the numbers progress counterclockwise, with the 0 being at about 5 o'clock. A curved device called a finger stop sits above the dial at approximately the 4 o'clock position. The physical nature of the dialing mechanism on rotary phones allowed the use of physical locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use. The lock could be integral to the phone itself or a separate device inserted through the finger hole nearest the finger stop to prevent the dial from rotating.|$|E
50|$|The handle {{was fitted}} in size {{according}} to the dimensions of an average face, which had been taken {{as the starting point}} of the design process. In the completed product, the distance between the transmitter (mouth piece) and the receiver (ear phone) was noticeably shorter than earlier models. The handle was made as light as possible to minimize the stress inflicted upon the wrist and blood veins of the speaker during long calls. The weight of the base unit was also minimized especially due to logistic and packaging reasons. The dial <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> and face plate consisted of several parts and was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} replace with a set of buttons in a later version of the phone.|$|E
50|$|For {{the initial}} years, from 1950 to 1953, the 500 was {{available}} only in black with a metal <b>finger</b> <b>wheel.</b> In 1954, color telephone sets were available in ivory, green, dark gray, red, brown, beige, yellow, and blue. Gray, blue, yellow, and red sets were initially assembled with black dials, until the colored parts became available by 1955. So called two-tone color varieties were available, which consisted of a black set having the housing substituted with a color plastic part. They were offered as an attractive color combination for a reduced fee from {{the price of a}} full color telephone. In 1957, gray, blue, beige, and brown sets were replaced with lighter pastel hues in light gray, aqua blue, light beige, white, and pink colors. Issuance of brown sets, however, continued for multi-line business sets for several years. Turquoise sets were added in 1964, and several colors, including pink and light gray, were discontinued in the late 1960s.|$|E
60|$|Sir George stepped in. The Vicomte, {{in whose}} <b>fingers</b> the <b>wheel</b> seemed {{scarcely}} to rest, so light and apparently careless was his touch, touched a lever by his side, released the clutch, and swung the great car {{round the corner}} at a speed which made Duncombe grasp the sides. At a pace which seemed to him most ridiculous, they dashed into the Rue de Rivoli, and with another sharp turn pulled up before Maxim's. The Vicomte rose with a yawn {{as though he had}} just awoke from a refreshing dream. His servant slipped off his fur coat, and he descended to the pavement faultlessly dressed and quite unruffled. The commissionaire preceded them, hat in hand, to the door. A couple of waiters ushered them to the table which the Vicomte intimated by a gesture.|$|R
50|$|When {{released}} at the <b>finger</b> stop, the <b>wheel</b> returns to its home position by spring action {{at a speed}} regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line (local loop) a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit. Each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses so the method is sometimes called decadic dialling.|$|R
5000|$|A rotating-wheel Braille display was {{developed}} in 2000 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and another at the Leuven University in Belgium. Both wheels {{are still in the}} process of commercialization. In these units, braille dots are put on the edge of a spinning wheel, which allows the user to read continuously with a stationary <b>finger</b> while the <b>wheel</b> spins at a selected speed. The braille dots are set in a simple scanning-style fashion as the dots on the wheel spin past a stationary actuator that sets the braille characters. As a result, manufacturing complexity is greatly reduced and rotating-wheel braille displays, when in actual production, should be less expensive than traditional braille displays.|$|R
50|$|Strowger also {{filed the}} first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the finger stop {{starting}} {{at a different}} position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by accumulation in digit registers.|$|E
50|$|The phone {{consisted}} of a rotary dial, a handset cradle, switch hook, and a handset (sometimes called the receiver) wired to the base, and was constructed of a molded plastic housing covering a steel chassis. The user interface {{consisted of}} only the dial and switch hook buttons. No other components, switches, or controls were necessary, {{with the exception of}} a loudness control for the ringer, which was accessible on the bottom of the phone. The handset cradle was a molded part of the housing, formed of two U-shaped chairs which cradled the handle of the handset between the receiver and the transmitter cups. Each side of the cradle had a round plastic plunger positioned above a pair of levers connected in a spring-loaded yoke that operated the hook switch; pressing the plungers down ended the call and placed the phone on-hook. The plastic face of the dial under and surrounding the <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> was an integral part of the dial assembly and was exposed through a large circular opening in the housing. On the bottom, the flat steel plate of the chassis was exposed. The handset cord exited from the left side of the housing at the base, and the line cord emerged from the rear at the base.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Navigating through online {{documents}} {{has become}} an increasingly common Human Computer Interaction (HCI) task. This paper investigates alternative methods to improve user performance for browsing World Wide Web and other documents. In a task that involved both scrolling and pointing, we compared three input methods against the status-quo. The results showed that a mouse with a <b>finger</b> <b>wheel</b> did not improve user’s performance; two other methods, namely a mouse with an isometric rate-control joystick operated by the same hand and a two handed system that put a mouse on the dominant hand and a joystick on the other, both signifi-cantly improved users ’ performance. A human factors analysis {{on each of the}} three input methods is presented...|$|E
60|$|The countrymen, {{instead of}} fleeing for their lives, came running at full speed, and laid {{hold of the}} topsy-turvy coach. I, also, though a small-sized man, went to work like a son of Anak. The coachman, too, with the blood still {{streaming}} from his nose, tugged and toiled most manfully, dreading, doubtless, that the next blow might break his head. And yet, bemauled as the poor fellow had been, he seemed to glance at me with an eye of pity, as if my case were more deplorable than his. But I cherished a hope that all would turn out a dream, and seized the opportunity, as we raised the coach, to jam two of my <b>fingers</b> under the <b>wheel,</b> trusting that the pain would awaken me.|$|R

60|$|For {{a moment}} the light {{streamed}} unbrokenly through the wood. And then it could be seen that the yellow mass of undergrowth HAD moved {{with the passage of}} another figure than his own. For ever since he had entered the shade, a woman, shawled in a vague, shapeless fashion, had watched him wonderingly, eagerly, excitedly, gliding from tree to tree as he advanced, or else dropping breathlessly below the fronds of fern whence she gazed at him as between parted <b>fingers.</b> When he <b>wheeled</b> she had run openly to the west, albeit with hidden face and still clinging shawl, and taken a last look at his retreating figure. And then, with a faint but lingering sigh, she drew back into the shadow of the wood again and vanished also.|$|R
30|$|Equal {{number of}} {{comparator}} implants (size 3.5  mm[*]×[*] 8  mm) were {{inserted in the}} other tibia/femur head of the animals after doing the osteotomy according to the manufacturer’s protocol as follows. After mobilizing the mucoperiosteal flap, the 3 -mm center punch was used to register a guide for the twist drill. The twist drill was used to establish the axial alignment of the implant and {{to assist in the}} guidance of the depth drill. The depth drills were sequentially used to create osteotomy to the subcrestal axial depth of 0.5  mm. The conical reamer was used to develop the conical shape of the implant body and to check the osteotomy depth. A counter-clockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used for dense bone to create the threads in the osteotomy. The thread cutter’s diameter corresponds to the implant diameter. To engage the implant into the implant placement tool, the square faces on the implant fixture mount were aligned with those on the implant placement tool, then pushed together. Using the handle (<b>finger</b> <b>wheel),</b> the implant was pulled out of inner vial and the plastic collar was discarded. The implant placement assembly was transferred to the osteotomy and the implant was secured into the osteotomy site. The implant placement was started with the handle and finally placed using the hand-ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was rinsed out and the depth was checked by retapping. To disengage fixture mount from implant, the open-ended spanner was used to break the retention force of the fixture mount retention screw. The knurled top of the implant placement tool was turned by hand to fully disengage the fixture mount with the implant. Pushing down on the knurled top of the implant placement tool disengaged the fixture mount.|$|E
40|$|A part {{device is}} used for {{gripping}} (1) and pre-adjustment is carried out of a part device for dismantling (13) and of the part device for gripping to the actual angle position in the space {{and the location of}} the wheel to be processed by a manipulator or an industrial robot (38). Before the commencement of a processing of a wheel (2) an automatically evolving measurement of all data necessary for the processing of the wheel is carried out with sensor devices together with processing for the formulation of control commands. The part device for gripping (1) of <b>wheels</b> has gripper <b>fingers</b> (3) so formed that between them a free space is formed. USE - The processing device may dismantle fitted wheels on a vehicle. ADVANTAGE - Dismantling is made possible without alignment of the wheel axle and independently of the different space angles of the fitted wheel on the vehicle. The force of the gripping <b>fingers</b> on the <b>wheels</b> is minimised...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "brain" [...] {{behind the}} click-wheel is the {{conductive}} membrane behind the plastic covering. This membrane has [...] "channels" [...] that when connected, create {{a set of}} coordinates. These channels are conductors, which when connected to another conductor (a finger in this case), try to send a current through the user's finger, but are blocked by the plastic covering the click-wheel. So instead of passing through the plastic, the current creates a charge at the closest location to the finger, which {{is also known as}} capacitance. The component that detects this change in capacitance is the controller. Whenever the controller senses a change, it sends a signal to the microprocessor, which performs the desired action. The faster a finger moves around the wheel, the more concentrated the stream of signals it sends out. The moment the <b>finger</b> leaves the <b>wheel,</b> however, is when the controller stops detecting change in capacitance, therefore stopping the current process.|$|R
