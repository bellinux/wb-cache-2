Policies put {{in place in the}} UK and Europe have promoted bioenergy and the growth of <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Despite the various policy support mechanisms the cultivation of perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> has proceeded at a low rate. This study rigorously analyses some of the key UK bioenergy policies since 1990 to assess why perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> have not fulfilled their potential. The UK <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> market is scrutinised and shows the industry is still nascent compared to Government aspirations. Case studies of both successful and unsuccessful projects are evaluated to reveal how effective different policies have been in establishing UK perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> This original review shows significantly that none of the projects, initiatives or schemes described can be viewed as an absolute success. The main obstacles that have hindered progress include: the lack of long term supportive <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> policy, the failure of headline projects and organisations, the lack of competitiveness of long term perennial crop options compared to annual crops, bureaucracy of schemes, over-ambitious projects, and large-scale support schemes tending to favour imported biomass rather than support domestic supply. 25 years of failed <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> policy suggests {{there needs to be a}} long term strategy. Future support for the sector must join up policy between different Government departments to recognise multi-functional benefits of perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Support mechanisms could aim to provide a competitive advantage for local supply and use, and improve management of cashflows during establishment. The risk burden should be shared between suppliers and end-users. Smaller-scale projects using established technologies are required with <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> introduced in a phased manner.

Assessment was supported by qualitative analysis aimed to highlight the stakeholders’ perspectives in understanding environmental effects and in promoting <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> local development. Perspectives were evaluated through a stakeholders’ involvement approach. We found that environmental impacts are not among the priority motivations that lead farmers to practice these <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Afterwards, some farmers’ profiles were estimated through the Multiple Correspondence Analysis. We found that perspectives on positive environmental effects caused by <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> are strongly related to positive expectations on their introduction into local cropping systems. Finally, we focused attention on assessing the environmental sustainability associated to substitution of some traditional <b>crops</b> with <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> in Sardinia.

Findings suggest that replacement of traditional <b>crops</b> with <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> might produce controversial benefits in terms of environmental sustainability variation.

40|$|Poland holds great {{potential}} for bioenergy. However, biomass production from dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> has not developed {{at a pace that}} was hoped. Clearly, there are barriers hindering farmers. The aim of this research was to directly explore the farmers’ perspective on barriers to growing dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> in Poland. During the on-the-ground research conducted in Poland the perceptions regarding the main barriers for willow cultivation for farmers in the Grudziądz region were investigated. Over 30 interviews were conducted with farmers and local actors. The bottom-line for not engaging in willow cultivation is that so far willow has not been perceived as being competitive with other traditional crops. The 4 most often mentioned barriers by farmers are as follows: financial, knowledge, equipment and market. Financial Barriers: In Poland, dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> appear to remain uncompetitive compared to other traditional crops. The relatively high establishment costs for switching to <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> is a major barrier for farmers, and the level of support offered for <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> is considered too low by farmers. Knowledge Barriers: A lack of information, tradition and experience with a novel crop such as willow is perceived as a factor hindering the development of <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Farmers often expressed the need for a demonstration project that would among other things also prove the yield level of willow. Equipment Barriers: The equipment for cultivating willow, especially harvesting equipment, is a problem. It is expensive, especially for farmers who have small farms, and there is no sense in purchasing the equipment individually. In the interviews, farmers suggested that collective ownership is needed. Market Barriers: Market related issues also came forward in the interviews. Farmers need to feel secure {{that there will be a}} market once it is time to sell the harvest and that they will get a reasonable price for their product.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} process produces biomethane as a {{renewable energy}} source. To optimize the <b>energy</b> production, <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> {{with a high}} biomethane yield per hectare should be identified. A large number of samples of maize, tall fescue, sorghum, spelt, miscanthus, immature rye, switchgrass, sunflower and hemp was cropped. The fresh biomass yield per hectare, the volatile solid (VS) content, the biochemical composition and the biochemical methane potential (BMP) were measured. Maize (annual plant) was shown {{to be the best}} methane yielding plant per hectare. Green miscanthus (perennial plant) appeared as a promising alternative to maize thanks to methane yields similar to maize. For the various <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> tested, the biomethane yield per hectare was significantly more influenced by the biomass yield per hectare, especially on a VS basis, than by the BMP. The BMP on a crude matter basis was mainly influenced by the VS content. The BMP measurement is essential for the assessment of the biomethane yield per hectare of <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> However, it is a time-consuming assay and requires dedicated scientific instruments. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was assessed as a tool to quickly predict the BMP of <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> The near infrared (NIR) spectra of wet silages and of dried and ground silages were measured on the harvested <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Both spectra types were used as predictors of the BMP of wet silages. For all <b>energy</b> <b>crops,</b> models based on NIR spectra of wet silages were able to predict the BMP on a crude matter basis. Specific prediction models were also developed for maize silages. The BMP on a volatile solids basis of crude wet silages was not well predicted. NIRS is a non-destructive and fast analytical technique to estimate the anaerobic digestibility of biomass. Methods based on NIRS could facilitate and fasten the selection of <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> dedicated to anaerobic digestion.
