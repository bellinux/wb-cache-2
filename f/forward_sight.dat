6000|$|Two-faced Janus,[1] god of Time! Be my Phoebus while I rhyme; To oblige your crony Swift, Bring our dame a new year's gift; She has got {{but half}} a face; Janus, since thou hast a brace, To my lady once be kind; Give her half thy face behind. [...] God of Time, if you be wise, Look not with your future eyes; What imports thy <b>forward</b> <b>sight?</b> Well, {{if you could}} lose it quite. Can you take delight in viewing This poor Isle's[2] {{approaching}} ruin, When thy retrospection vast Sees the glorious ages past? Happy nation, were we blind, Or had only eyes behind! [...] Drown your morals, madam cries, I'll have none but forward eyes; Prudes decay'd about may tack, Strain their necks with looking back. Give me time when coming on; Who regards him when he's gone? By the Dean though gravely told, New-years help to make me old; Yet I find a new-year's lace Burnishes an old-year's face. Give me velvet and quadrille, I'll have youth and beauty still.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of the}} tri-oval {{shape for}} {{automobile}} racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans {{to look back and}} forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to [...] "lean" [...] to see oncoming cars, and creates more <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> lines.|$|E
5000|$|Upper {{and lower}} {{receiver}}s: The lower receiver {{is a standard}} M4A1 lower receiver sometimes modified {{with the addition of}} a CQD RSM sling adapter plate. However, many CQBR rifles also use surplus M16A1 lower receivers. Internally, the CQBR also takes advantage of a larger gas port and modified bolt carrier and buffer assembly. The gas port has been opened to 0.070 in (1.8 mm). A number of Lewis Machine & Tool 10.5" [...] (266.7 mm) upper receivers have also been reported to have been purchased for the CQBR program. These upper receivers feature a gas system optimized for short barrel use. The Mod 1 makes use of a <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> delete and full-length handguard to provide more rail space for the user.|$|E

50|$|The {{weapon is}} aimed using iron sights that consist of an {{adjustable}} rear notch and fixed <b>forward</b> blade. The <b>sights</b> have aiming inserts for improved visibility and target acquisition.|$|R
5000|$|The tri-oval is {{the common}} shape of the ovals from the {{construction}} booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans {{to look back and}} forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to [...] "lean" [...] to see oncoming cars, and creates more <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as cookie cutters because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.|$|E
5000|$|The Rk 62 is {{considered}} a high quality AK-47 variant. The biggest single improvement, apart from the metallurgical quality of the receiver and {{the overall quality of}} the barrel, are the sights - most AK variants have the rear sight mounted on top of the gas piston housing on top of the receiver. In the Rk62 the rear sight is mounted on the rear of the receiver cover with tritium illuminated night-sights. The sight radius is doubled enhancing the accuracy along with the hammer-forged match CM barrel. Aperture rear sight on a sliding tangent with flip tritium night sight, forward hooded post, 470 mm sight radius. This is apparent especially in its accuracy, as it can frequently achieve less than one minute of arc. The rifle uses a [...] "peep" [...] diopter sight, which is flipped over to reveal the open tritium enhanced rear night sight. The <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> has also a mode for night operation.|$|E
50|$|The strait also {{experiences}} {{significant amounts}} of international commercial shipping traffic by freighters and tankers. Between its northern limits at Rumeli Feneri and Anadolu Feneri and its southern ones at Ahırkapı Feneri and Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri, there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between Kandilli Point and Aşiyan requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach 7 to 8 kn. To the south, at Yeniköy, the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. Compounding these difficult changes in trajectory, the rear and <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> lines at Kandilli and Yeniköy are also completely blocked prior to and during the course alteration, {{making it impossible for}} ships approaching from the opposite direction to see around these bends. The risks posed by geography are further multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city. As such, all the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane.|$|E
5000|$|Sources {{disagree}} {{on what happened}} next. One source states that Zumalacárregui sent Ituralde's advanced guard, which had not yet seen action, to counter this rearguard action. [...] Another states that Ituralde, [...] "urged by an inconsiderate ardour which overcame his judgment, brought <b>forward</b> into <b>sight</b> his four battalions." [...] These battalions, forming the left wing, had been concealed from view by the hill beneath which they were stationed.|$|R

60|$|Prothero {{started in}} pursuit. He glimpsed the dog-cart turning into Bridge Street. He had an {{impression}} that Benham used the whip at the corner, and that the dog-cart went <b>forward</b> out of <b>sight</b> with a startled jerk. Prothero quickened his pace.|$|R
5000|$|The T68 core is {{a design}} similar in action to the Spyder markers. Primary systems (Barrel, Air System, Feed System & Trigger) {{attach to the}} core. Additional {{external}} components add to the overall M-4 look. These include a carry handle (fixed or removable with RIS weaver rail), T-charging (cocking) handle (Gen 3 upwards), pistol grip with trigger guard, faux clip housing with working magazine release, fake magazine with hollow interior (for storage), M-4 handguard assembly with interchangeable front handguards, M-4 <b>forward</b> <b>sight</b> with bayonet lug and sling loop, and either 3-position M4 Carbine or fixed M-16A2 style stock. Various barrel lengths and styles are available, from 1" [...] through 20", with interchangeable muzzle flash suppressors or faux silencers. The barrels use Spyder threads, so aftermarket barrels are also capable of being used. Made from machined aircraft aluminum, the marker is mechanical, with no electronic parts in its factory form. A screw is provided under the stock for adjustment of the shooting velocity, and a simple push-safe safety is situated {{just ahead of the}} trigger on the core.|$|E
60|$|The seagreen Pontiff takes a torch, Painter David handing it; mouths {{some other}} froth-rant of vocables, which happily one cannot hear; strides resolutely <b>forward,</b> in <b>sight</b> of {{expectant}} France; sets his torch to Atheism and Company, which are but made of pasteboard steeped in turpentine. They burn up rapidly; and, from within, there rises 'by machinery' an incombustible Statue of Wisdom, which, by ill hap, gets besmoked a little; but does stand there visible in as serene attitude as it can.|$|R

50|$|However, Bol's other {{basketball}} {{skills were}} very limited, and his rail-thin physique {{made it difficult}} for him to establish position against the league's bulkier centers and power <b>forwards.</b> The <b>sight</b> of the tall, gangly Bol spotting up for a three-pointer during blow-outs became a fan favorite. Off the court, he established a reputation as a practical joker; Charles Barkley, a frequent victim of his pranks, attested to Bol's sense of humor. Bol also developed a close friendship with Warriors teammate Chris Mullin and named one of his sons after him.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heavy cruiser}} Prinz Eugen sailed at about 21:00 on 18 May 1941 from Gotenhafen (now Gdynia, Poland), {{followed}} at 2:00 am, 19 May, by Bismarck. Both ships proceeded under escort, separately and rendezvoused off Cape Arkona on Rügen Island {{in the western}} Baltic. They then proceeded through the Danish Islands into the Kattegat. Entering the Kattegat on 20 May Bismarck and Prinz Eugen sailed north toward the Skagerrak, the strait between Jutland and Southern Norway where they were sighted by the Swedish aircraft-carrying cruiser [...] on around 1:00 pm. Gotland <b>forwarded</b> the <b>sighting</b> in a routine report.|$|R
60|$|I dimly {{remember}} that as she {{backed away from}} me until her shoulders touched the wall, that as she stood so, all white and lovely as any snare that Satan ever devised for man's ruin, staring at me with mutely pleading eyes, I staggered <b>forward,</b> avoiding the <b>sight</b> of that dreadful huddle on the floor, over which Busio was weeping foolishly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Caryll stepped <b>forward</b> quickly. The <b>sight</b> {{of those}} tears, {{springing}} from that dried-up heart--withered by God alone knew what blight--washing {{their way down}} those poor bedaubed cheeks, moved him to a keener pity than anything he had ever looked upon. He took her hands, and pressed them a moment, giving way for once to an impulse he could not master.|$|R
60|$|Pan rode {{a mile to}} the left, {{somewhat}} up {{hill and}} also <b>forward.</b> He caught <b>sight</b> of his father, and two other riders, rather far ahead, riding, shooting either behind or {{in front of a}} waving pall of dust. The ground down there was dry, and though covered with grass and sage, it had equally as much bare surface, from which the plunging hoofs kicked up the yellow smoke.|$|R
25|$|Barn funnel weavers {{are active}} and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and {{movement}} speed {{as well as}} web mechanisms. Their eye configuration, with six out of eight <b>sighting</b> <b>forward,</b> allows them to distinguish even the smallest movement {{in front of them}} and either follow it, or retreat, if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be photosensitive, i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations.|$|R
6000|$|Uriel. Not unobserved thou goest, whoe'er thou art; Whether some spirit on holy purpose bent, Or some fallen angel {{from below}} broke loose, Who com'st, with envious eyes and curst intent, To view {{this world and}} its created lord: Here will I watch, and, while my orb rolls on, Pursue from hence thy much {{suspected}} flight, And, if disguised, pierce through with beams of light. [...] [The Chariot drives <b>forward</b> out of <b>sight.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Scout Squad is an M1A marketed toward law {{enforcement}} users. It has an 18-inch barrel, a <b>forward</b> mounted optical <b>sight</b> base, and a proprietary muzzle stabilizer.

It is available in both wood stocked and synthetic furniture options with different colours of wood and synthetic stocks.|$|R
6000|$|At a {{sign from}} Heyst, Wang {{hammered}} at the brass {{tap on the}} wharf, then stood behind Number One, crowbar in hand, motionless as before. Ricardo was perhaps not so certain of Pedro's toughness as he affirmed; for he stooped, peering under the wharf, then moved <b>forward</b> out of <b>sight.</b> The gush of water ceasing suddenly, made a silence which became complete when the after-trickle stopped. Afar, the sun {{was reduced to a}} red spark, glowing very low in the breathless immensity of twilight. Purple gleams lingered on the water all round the boat. The spectral figure in the stern-sheets spoke in a languid tone: ...|$|R
50|$|The MRO-A is {{a smaller}} {{development}} of the RPO-series with caliber reduced to 72.5 mm, similar to the RShG-2. It is self-contained, disposable, single-shot recoilless launcher with an overall length of 900 mm, weight of 4.7 kg, and has a folding <b>forward</b> grip. The <b>sights</b> are RPO-based, with a fixed front and folding ladder-type diopter rear, giving an effective range of 90 m and maximum range of 450 m. The MRO-series includes different versions, again based on RPO versions: MRO-A thermobaric; MRO-D white phosphorus smoke; and MRO-Z incendiary. It {{was adopted by the}} Russian Army around 2002 and issued to chemical troops to supplement the larger RPO-A.|$|R
60|$|Razumov started <b>forward,</b> but the <b>sight</b> of Haldin's raised hand checked {{him before}} he could get away from the table. He leaned on it heavily, {{listening}} to the faint sounds of some town clock tolling the hour. Haldin, already at the door, tall and straight as an arrow, with his pale face and a hand raised attentively, might have posed for the statue of a daring youth listening to an inner voice. Razumov mechanically glanced down at his watch. When he looked towards the door again Haldin had vanished. There was a faint rustling in the outer room, the feeble click of a bolt drawn back lightly. He was gone--almost as noiseless as a vision.|$|R
60|$|But, lo! a {{black line}} creeps up the western horizon. Tom, gesticulating, swears {{that he sees}} 'a billow break.' True: there they come; the great white horses, that 'champ and chafe, and toss in the spray.' That long-becalmed trawler to seaward fills, and heels over, and begins to tug and leap impatiently at {{the weight of her}} heavy trawl. Five minutes more, and the breeze will be down upon us. The young men whistle openly to woo it; the old father thinks such a superstition {{somewhat}} beneath both his years and his religion, but cannot help pursing up his lips into a sly 'whe-eugh' when he has got well <b>forward</b> out of <b>sight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The weapon's {{introduction}} was {{not without}} criticism. Soldiers complained about switching from the simple, more streamlined M203 to one with more sophisticated attachments (although this could be attributed simply to the change from a long-standing [...] "tried and true" [...] system to a new one). Complaints ranged from the <b>forward</b> grip and <b>sighting</b> system, the pistol grip handle catching on things, and the side loading mechanism. They even criticized its ability {{to act as a}} stand-alone launcher, a feature included in response to troops re-acquiring Vietnam-era M79 grenade launchers that supposedly gave better accuracy when fired from the shoulder than if slung under a rifle, although the collapsible stock is somewhat short for the task.|$|R
25|$|The {{sights on}} the Jarmann M1884, as first issued, were {{graduated}} from 200 m to 1600 m. There was an additional sidemounted volley sight, intended for indirect volley fire over long distances, from 1600 m to 2400 m. To be effective, an entire company would have to fire at the same time, which would ensure {{that at least some}} of the bullets found their targets. During production, the sights were modified, and M1884s with serial numbers higher than 4330 also had a battle sight fitted to the backside of the sight leaf, which could be revealed by folding the leaf fully <b>forward.</b> The battle <b>sight</b> was set to a fixed range of about 430 m (470 yd), close to the maximum point-blank range of the weapon.|$|R
