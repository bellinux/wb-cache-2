25|$|If {{the person}} has kidney failure or {{cutaneous}} vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. On rare occasions, thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammation</b> (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are {{the main reason for}} the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. However, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.|$|E

40|$|Central {{diabetes}} insipidus (DI) {{can be the}} outcome of a number of diseases that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis. The causes of the condition can be classified as traumatic, inflammatory, or neoplastic. Traumatic causes include postoperative sella or transection of the pituitary stalk, while infectious or inflammatory causes include meningitis, lymphocytic hypophysitis, and <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> such as sarcoidosis and Wegener’s granulomatosis. Various neoplastic conditions such as germinoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, metastasis, leukemic infiltration, lymphoma, teratoma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, Rathke cleft cyst, hypothalamic glioma, and meningioma are also causes of central DI. In affected patients, careful analysis of these MR imaging features and correlation with the clinical manifestations can allow a more specific diagnosis, which is essential for treatment.

In rare cases, the clinical presentation and the intraoperative findings may mimic those of advanced stage ovarian cancers. Two cases of ruptured mature cystic teratomas mimick-ing malignancy are reported in 50 - and 53 -year-old patients. Both presented with abdominal distension and weight loss. Elevation of serum CA- 125 (233 unit/ml) was detected in one case. Intraoperatively, nodular thickening of the omentum with marked peritoneal adhesion was observed in both cases.

40|$|In hepatosplenic {{schistosomiasis}} mansoni, the pathological {{effects can}} be largely attributed to the T lymphocyte-mediated granulomatous host response (1, 2). The chronic <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> terminate in reparative fibrosis, {{which can lead to}} portal hypertension, esophageal varices, bleeding, and death (3). Andrade and Warren (4, 5) first showed, that mice with chronic schistosomiasis at the late stage of the infection displayed a spontaneous diminution in granuloma size, with a corresponding improvement in the clinico-pathological parameters of the disease. Periodic injection of eggs has shown that whereas at 8 wk of the infection mice mounted large pulmonary granulomatous reactions, beyond 16 wk granuloma formation decreased significantly, thus indicating a desensitization process (6). Further analysis showed that this process entailed complex changes in the humoral and cell-mediated eggspecific immune responses as well as the lymphocyte dynamics of the infected mice. Thus, passive hemagglutination and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis tests showed an increase in the level of circulating anti-soluble egg antigen (SEA) 1 antibodies. In contrast, delayed footpad reaction of infected mice was abrogated, and no migratio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> in {{schistosomiasis}} mansoni are {{the result}} of T-cell-mediated reactions to soluble egg antigens (SEA) secreted by parasite ova. To study TDH effector cell function, a granuloma T-cell line was established from collagenase-digested liver granulomas of acutely infected CBA/J mice. Dispersed nonadherent granuloma cells were cultured with feeder layer cells and SEA or with feeder layer cells alone in alternate cycles for 32 weeks. The granuloma T-cell line was L 3 T 4 + Lyt- 1 +. In vitro, the SEA-stimulated T cells showed proliferation and interleukin 2 production. One million T cells adoptively transferred SEA-specific footpad swelling, and 7. 5 X 10 (6) T cells adoptively transferred granulomatous hypersensitivity to injected ova or SEA-coated beads. Anti-L 3 T 4 monoclonal antibody blocked the SEA-specific cell proliferation. Depletion of L 3 T 4 + cells abrogated, while that of Lyt- 1 + cells diminished the adoptive transfer of SEA-specific footpad swelling. These experiments demonstrate that the granuloma T-lymphocyte population contains TDH-type effector cells. Establishment of an SEA-specific granuloma T-cell line will allow the study of the effector functions of the hitherto uncharacterized intralesional granuloma T lymphocyte...|$|R

40|$|Background: In our {{clinical}} set up transbonchial needle aspiration of {{lymph node}} and parenchymal lesions is an underutilized technique.

Methods: Thirty procedures were performed on patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy or parenchymal lung lesions in this study from October, 2006 to April, 2007. Patients with an easily accessible peripheral lymph node, bleeding diathesis and an already confirmed diagnosis {{were excluded from the}} study as were patients with a well visualized biopsiable endobronchial lesion. Results: Nineteen patients (63. 3 %) on whom transbonchial needle aspirations were performed had intrathoracic lymphadenopathy while 11 (36. 6 %) had parenchymal lesions without endobronchial lesions which could be biopsied. Adequate samples were obtained in 23 patients (76. 6 %) chronic <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> which was diagnosed as tuberculosis in corroboration with other clinical and laboratory evidence was seen in 3 cases (10 %).

40|$|In sheep scrapie, {{pathological}} {{prion protein}} (PrP(Sc)) deposition {{occurs in the}} lymphoreticular and central nervous systems. We investigated PrP(Sc) distribution in scrapie-affected sheep showing simultaneous evidence of chronic lymphofollicular, lymphoproliferative/non-lymphofollicular, and/or <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> in their mammary gland, lung, and ileum. To do this, PrP(Sc) detection was carried out via immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting techniques, {{as well as through}} inflammatory cell immunophenotyping. Expression studies of gene coding for biological factors modulating the host's inflammatory response were also carried out. We demonstrated that ectopic PrP(Sc) deposition occurs exclusively in the context of lymphofollicular inflammatory sites, inside newly formed and well-organized lymphoid follicles harboring follicular dendritic cells. On the contrary, no PrP(Sc) deposition was detected in granulomas, even when they were closely located to newly formed lymphoid follicles. A significantly more consistent expression of lymphotoxin α and β mRNA was detected in lymphofollicular inflammation compared to the other two types, with lymphotoxin α and β signaling new lymphoid follicles' formation and, likely, the occurrence of ectopic PrP(Sc) deposition inside them. Our findings suggest that, in sheep co-affected by scrapie and chronic inflammatory conditions, only newly formed lymphoid follicles provide a suitable micro-environment that supports the scrapie agent's replication in inflammatory sites, with an increased risk of prion shedding through body secretions/excretions...|$|R
40|$|Two {{closely related}} {{bacterial}} species, Segniliparus rotundus and Segniliparus rugosus, {{have emerged as}} important human pathogens, but {{little is known about}} the immune responses they elicit or their comparative pathophysiologies. To determine the virulence and immune responses of the two species, we compared their abilities to grow in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Both species maintained non-replicating states within A 549 epithelial cells. S. rugosus persisted longer and multiplied more rapidly inside murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), induced more pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induced higher levels of macrophage necrosis. Activation of BMDMs by both species was mediated by toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2), followed by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling pathways, indicating a critical role for TLR 2 in Segniliparus-induced macrophage activation. S. rugosus triggered faster and stronger activation of MAPK signaling and IkB degradation, indicating that S. rugosus induces more pro-inflammatory cytokines than S. rotundus. Multifocal <b>granulomatous</b> <b>inflammations</b> in the liver and lung were observed in mice infected with S. rugosus, but S. rotundus was rapidly cleared from all organs tested within 15 days post-infection. Furthermore, S. rugosus induced faster infiltration of innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages to the lung than S. rotundus...|$|R
