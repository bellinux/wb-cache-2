5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different <b>each</b> <b>time</b> it is played.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{verification of}} safety properties for parameterized systems of timed processes, so called timed networks. A timed network {{consists of a}} finite state process, called a controller, and an arbitrary set of identical timed processes. In a previous work, we showed that checking safety properties is decidable in the case where <b>each</b> <b>timed</b> process {{is equipped with a}} single real-valued clock. It was left open whether the result could be extended to multi-clock timed networks. We show that the problem becomes undecidable when <b>each</b> <b>timed</b> process has two clocks. On the other hand, we show that the problem is decidable when clocks range over a discrete time domain. This decidability result holds when processes have any finite number of clocks. ...|$|R

5|$|In August 1868 Parry and {{his family}} arrived in England, where he began a three-year study at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry {{appeared}} before Queen Victoria three times, <b>each</b> <b>time</b> by her special request. The Queen made another request of Parry <b>each</b> <b>time</b> he appeared: that he perform only works he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his Bachelor's degree, Parry {{and his family}} returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music {{for the next three}} years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, becoming the university's first Professor of Music.|$|E

The average lifespan of C.mutica in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E

5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at <b>each</b> <b>time</b> step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at <b>each</b> <b>time</b> step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
