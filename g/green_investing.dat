40|$|Sustainability {{thinking}} is rapidly gaining traction. It o­ffers an inspiring {{vision for the}} future of the world and provides significant business and investment opportunities. Based on insights from over 300 empirical studies, this book explores the possibilities in the field of renewable energy finance, carbon trading, and sustainable investing. In addition, it describes innovative finance mechanisms - such as green bonds and peer-to-peer lending - that may further spur environmental and social sustainability. By taking an empirical, fact-based approach, this book aims to provide investors, business executives, and policymakers with a more thorough understanding of how sustainable finance can create value for business and society.

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>investing,</b> or {{socially}} responsible investing (SRI), which refers to making investment decisions according to both financial and ethical criteria, has become in-creasingly popular in recent years. This paper explores the effects of ethical screening on the investment decisions of firms that fail the screen (’polluting ’ firms) and on their decisions to reform so as to pass the screen. The paper also analyzes the impact that short selling polluting firms by green investors would have on these firms. These issues are examined in an equilibrium setting with endogenous investment decisions and endogenous future outputs. We find that green investors can induce polluting firms to reform and that screening results in under-investing by polluting firms and over-investing by clean firms. We also find that short selling polluting firms by green investors can significantly increase polluting firms ’ cost of capital and that it can lever-age the effect on polluting firms ’ decisions to reform. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, MIT’s Peter Senge et al. {{wrote that}} the Industrial Age bubble was ending and that, {{especially}} due to climate change, a “Necessary Revolution” was needed to create a sustainable flourishing world in the decades ahead. Since then, many business organizations have moved toward sustainability to some degree, and many other organizations have emerged, mostly non-profits, to help business and/or prod them to pursue ethical strategies. This report explains how the revolution is unfolding, by briefly mapping some 150 organizations that are driving the greening of capitalism, and grouping them in several meaningful categories: Business-Led Groups, Ethical Groups, Broadened Accounting Groups, Certifying Organizations, <b>Green</b> <b>Investing</b> Groups, Sustainability Consultants, and Green Business Publishing. Each of these groups is important in facilitating the revolution, especially those promoting corporate social responsibility, broader accounting practices, certification, and <b>green</b> <b>investing.</b> Among groups that list their beginning, the median start-up date was 2003 —thus a doubling in 13 years. This revolution certainly appears to be well underway, leading to a contest between 21 st Century Green (or Sustainable) Capitalism, valuing the triple bottom line of People/Planet/Profit to some degree vs. 20 th Century Industrial Era Capitalism that adheres to a single bottom line and narrow accounting measures. But the revolution is a quiet one that is underappreciated, due to fragmentation and lack of leadership. Hopefully, if well-publicized and widely discussed, the January 2017 Better Business, Better World report of the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, making a strong all-win business case for pursuing the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, could provide a large boost to the necessary revolution. In turn, this could energize the larger system of more than 1500 sustainability-related organizations that are identified in the 329 -page April 2017 Interim Draft of The Security & Sustainability Guide. We are not yet winning the struggle for sustainability in our era of great and intensifying uncertainty and danger. But with cities and responsible business taking the lead, and with more horizontal thinking that includes broad consideration of security issues, the necessary revolution can become more visible and thus accelerate...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to compare the investment performance of green and non-green stocks across four investment styles. Recent literature suggests a lack of consensus among researchers in respect {{of the performance of}} <b>green</b> <b>investing,</b> Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues, or Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) relative to more traditional forms of investing. Previous research has focused predominantly on the performance of funds thereby taking into account the skills of fund managers in selecting stocks. Additionally, the existing literature’s focus has been on SRI relative to traditional investing or green relative to SRI investing. This research therefore contributes to closing a gap in the literature by investigating the performance of green stocks versus non-green stocks in the market. Monthly investment returns of green portfolios for four investment styles were compared to their non-green equivalent, over four different time periods. Time weighted returns and Sharpe ratios, to measure risk-adjusted returns, were also computed for further analysis. The research indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} between the monthly returns of green portfolios versus non-green portfolios in the four investments styles over all periods investigated. Time weighted returns showed that green portfolios outperformed non-green portfolios in 14 of the 16 style/periods investigated. The Sharpe ratios showed risk-adjusted returns were consistent with the findings of the time-weighted returns. However, the non-green value/mid-cap portfolio was the only portfolio to have positive returns and Sharpe ratio for the 2008 - 2009 crisis period. The importance of the research is to discover performance trends of green and non-green stocks within different investment styles, irrespective of fund manager skill, which may be informative and helpful for investors when choosing which stocks to invest in...|$|E

50|$|Green {{sturgeon}} fertilization and hatching {{rates are}} 41.2% and 28.0%, compared with 95.4% and 82.1% {{for the white}} sturgeon (Deng et al. 2002). However, the survival of green sturgeon larvae is very high (93.3%) (Deng et al. 2002). Female <b>green</b> sturgeon <b>invest</b> a greater amount of their reproductive resources into maternal yolk for nourishment of the embryo, which results in larger larvae (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Five-day-old green sturgeon larvae have almost twice the weight of white sturgeon larvae (65 versus 34 milligrams (mg)) (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). This greater reserve of maternal yolk and larger larvae could provide an advantage in larval feeding and survival (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Compared with other acipenserids, green sturgeon larvae appear more robust and easier to rear (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Juveniles continue to grow rapidly, reaching 300 mm in 1 year and over 600 mm within 2-3 years for the Klamath River (USFWS 1995). Juveniles spend from 1-4 years in fresh and estuarine waters and disperse into salt water at lengths of 300-750 mm (USFWS 1995).|$|R

We build a model encompassing a late and early investment stage, a clean (green) and dirty (brown) technologies, and a single transmission bottleneck and compare dynamic efficiency of several market designs. Allocating network access on a short-term competitive basis distorts investment decisions as brown firms will pre-empt <b>green</b> competitors by <b>investing</b> early. Compensating early investors for future network congestion, as for instance in the E. U., only exacerbates this problem. Dynamic efficiency is restored with long-term transmission rights that can be traded on a secondary market (iusvendendi). As early investment lowers the resale value of the transmission rights, brown firms will invest optimally. We show that dynamic efficiency does not require the existence of physical rights for accessing the transmission line (ius utendi), but financial rights on receiving the scarcity revenues generated by the transmission line (ius fructendi) suffice...|$|R
