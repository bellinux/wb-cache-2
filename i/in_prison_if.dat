25|$|On , 2016, Slager {{was indicted}} on federal charges of violating Scott’s {{civil rights and}} unlawfully using a weapon during the {{commission}} of a crime. In addition, {{he was charged with}} obstruction of justice {{as a result of his}} statement to state investigators that Scott was moving toward him with the Taser when he shot him. Slager pled not guilty in the case, and a trial was scheduled to begin in May 2017. Slager faced up to life <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 2010, Espada and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, {{were indicted}} on six federal counts of {{embezzlement}} and theft. The indictment was by U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch, and also announced by New York State Attorney General and Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo.

They faced up to 55 years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted of all charges.|$|E
25|$|Under German {{criminal}} code (§90a Strafgesetzbuch (StGB)) {{it is illegal}} to revile or damage the German federal flag as well as any flags of its states in public. Offenders can be fined or sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison, or fined or sentenced to a maximum of five years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> the act was intentionally used to support the eradication of the Federal Republic of Germany or to violate constitutional rights. Actual convictions because of a violation of the {{criminal code}} need to be balanced against the constitutional right of the freedom of expression, as ruled multiple times by Germany's constitutional court.|$|E

5|$|If {{someone is}} {{found guilty of}} an attempt, they are sentenced under section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with the same period <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> as <b>if</b> they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced {{to a maximum of}} seven years.|$|R

25|$|On 4 August 2002, Whiting was {{attacked}} {{with a razor}} by another prisoner while fetching hot water at Wakefield Prison. Convicted killer Rickie Tregaskis (serving life imprisonment with a 25-year recommended minimum for the 1997 murder of a disabled man in Cornwall) {{was found guilty of}} carrying out the slashing which left Whiting with a six-inch scar on his right cheek. Tregaskis received a six-year sentence (to run concurrently alongside his life sentence) after being found guilty on a wounding charge relating to the attack on Roy Whiting. This will not mean that he will have to serve any extra time <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> the Parole Board decides that he can be freed on life licence.|$|E
25|$|If a {{plaintiff}} was successful before the court, the plaintiff could obtain a warrant of execution against the defendant's goods and chattels (called fieri facias). This in effect allowed the Provost Marshal {{to seize the}} defendant’s goods and sell them, subsequently paying the proceeds to the plaintiff. Alternatively, the defendant could be imprisoned until the debt and costs were satisfied. As in English law, the plaintiff was required to maintain the debtor in prison by paying what was called groats. The defendant could say on oath {{that he had no}} means of maintaining himself <b>in</b> <b>prison.</b> <b>If</b> this occurred, the plaintiff had to provide maintenance for him in prison according to the order of the Court. If the amount ordered by the court was not paid for one week, the debtor could be discharged from prison and also discharged from the debt.|$|E
25|$|AAS {{are banned}} by all major sports bodies {{including}} Association of Tennis Professionals, Major League Baseball, Fédération Internationale de Football Association the Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains {{the list of}} performance-enhancing substances used by many major sports bodies and includes all anabolic agents, which includes all AAS and precursors {{as well as all}} hormones and related substances. Spain has passed an anti-doping law creating a national anti-doping agency. Italy passed a law in 2000 where penalties range up to three years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> an athlete has tested positive for banned substances. In 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law ratification of the International Convention Against Doping in Sport which would encourage cooperation with WADA. Many other countries have similar legislation prohibiting AAS in sports including Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.|$|E

It was reported that Archbishop Leo Cushley was supportive of this project.|$|R
50|$|Informants {{are often}} {{regarded}} as traitors by their former criminal associates. Whatever {{the nature of}} a group, it is likely to feel strong hostility toward any known informers, regard them as threats and inflict punishments ranging from social ostracism through physical abuse and/or death. Informers are therefore generally protected, either by being segregated while <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> or, <b>if</b> they are not incarcerated, relocated under a new identity.|$|R

Shell's in charge - and wherever Rachel goes she'll always be watching over her like a [...] "GUARDIAN ANGEL".|$|R
25|$|Rains argued {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing that Mehserle lacked the malice necessary for a murder charge and {{that he intended to}} tase Grant. A BART officer testified, saying that Grant and his friends had yelled profanities and did not obey her orders to sit down moments before Mehserle fired at Grant. She said she was fearful when she heard taunts coming from Grant, his friends, and passengers on the train. After the seven days of testimony, Judge C. Don Clay concluded that Mehserle had not mistakenly used his service pistol instead of his stun gun. The judge based this on Mehserle's statements to other officers that he thought Grant had a gun. He also noted that Mehserle had held his weapon with both hands, but he was trained to use just his left if he was firing a Taser. Mehserle faced up to life <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted of first-degree murder.|$|E
25|$|However, Tenpenny {{decides to}} get more use out of CJ. Instead of {{throwing}} CJ in prison, Tenpenny drives him into the rural country outside Los Santos, and threatens to arrange Sweet's death <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> CJ doesn't cooperate. Exiled in the countryside, CJ is forced to carry out favors for C.R.A.S.H, under threat of Sweet being transferred to a cell block where Ballas affiliates are housed. He also works with Cesar's cousin Catalina to make money by carrying out several heists in the area. He also befriends a hippie named The Truth and a blind Chinese-American Triad leader named Wu Zi Mu. After winning the deed to a garage in San Fierro in a race against Catalina and her new boyfriend, CJ goes there with The Truth, Cesar and Kendl to get it up and running {{so they can make}} a living. While in San Fierro, CJ crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Big Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. CJ infiltrates the organization and identifies its leader, Mike Toreno. CJ kills Ryder and the other Loco Syndicate leaders, Jizzy B and T-Bone Mendez, and shoots down Toreno's helicopter. CJ then destroys the Syndicate's drug factory.|$|E
500|$|All three {{suspects}} were arraigned {{and charged with}} aggravated first degree murder for the killing of Timoshenko, and other charges related to the wounding of Yan, including attempted murder and aggravated assault on a police officer. [...] They faced life <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted of the first degree murder charges. The city's police union and other parties asked federal prosecutors {{to take over the}} case so that the three suspects could face the death penalty, but the case was tried by the Brooklyn district attorney on November 10, 2008, after federal officials refused to prosecute the case. [...] Although the three defendants were being prosecuted simultaneously, there was a rare separate jury assigned to each of them.|$|E

Noriega was convicted in absentia, but French law requires a new trial after the subject of an in absentia sentence is apprehended. He faced up to 10 years <b>in</b> French <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted. France had previously made Noriega a Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur in 1987.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, as a {{consequence}} of the FBI investigation, former Travel Office Director Billy Dale was indicted by a federal grand jury on December 7, 1994, on two counts of embezzlement and criminal conversion, charged with wrongfully depositing into his own bank account $68,000 in checks from media organizations traveling with the president during the period between 1988 and 1991. [...] He faced up to 20years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> convicted. [...] Dale's attorneys conceded that funds had been co-mingled, but stated that Dale had not stolen anything but rather used the monies for the substantial tips and off-the-book payments that the job required, especially in foreign countries, and that anything left over was used as a discount against future trips.|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less you want them in your community." ...|$|E
500|$|He was {{in charge}} for the first game at the Walkers Stadium. Despite a good start to their campaign, the club fell into the relegation zone in the new year. Adams was clearly resentful of lucrative long term {{contracts}} dealt out to his less talented players by previous managers, which restricted his ability to bring in fresh faces to boost their campaign. Leicester slipped back down again in 2003–04 to 18th place, bracketed together with the two other relegated sides — Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers — whose goal difference was inferior to Leicester's. The [...] "Foxes" [...] were becoming a [...] "yo-yo club" [...] and Adams blamed this on a lack of investment. During March 2004 nine Leicester players were arrested for various offences related to a drunken outing that ended with an alleged sexual assault on three German tourists, with three players being charged: Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie. The three faced up to fourteen years <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> <b>if</b> found guilty of rape, and the trio's bail totalled £196,500. The club had already been rocked by various incidents on overseas tours over years, with Stan Collymore arrested for setting off a fire extinguisher in 2000, and Dennis Wise breaking Callum Davidson's jaw in a row over a card game in 2002. Adams had previously initiated a crackdown in club discipline, {{going so far as}} to enforce random breathalyser tests. Adams said that [...] "in a lot of people's eyes, the players are guilty before they have had a fair trial – which is not the case". The incident also cast doubt over Adams' future at the club, as reports surfaced that he planned to quit the club. He did in fact offer his resignation, which was rejected by the club. However, he kept faith in his players' innocence, and claimed [...] "if they are guilty of anything it is of being unprofessional – of being drunk to excess". His faith was later vindicated when it transpired that all allegations against the players were false.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{material}} that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey.
