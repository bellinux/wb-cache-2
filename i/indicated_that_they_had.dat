As recorded in the 2013 census, about 49percent of the population identified themselves as Christians, although regular church attendance is estimated at 15percent. Another 41.9percent <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no religion (up from 34.7percent in 2006) and around 6percent affiliated with other religions.|$|E

5|$|The Engineering Department had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders, which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E

5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

25|$|There were 15,890 Roman Catholics in {{the area}} at census time.

Non-Irish nationals accounted for 15.8 per cent {{of the population of}} Sligo compared with a national average figure of 12.0 per cent.

25|$|While Cork {{saw some}} Jewish {{immigration}} from Eastern Europe in the 19th century, with second-generation immigrants like Gerald Goldberg holding public office, the community subsequently declined and the synagogue closed. Later immigrant communities retain their places of worship. In the 2011 and 2016 censuses, Roman Catholicism {{was the most}} common religion in the city overall, followed by Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, and Islam. As of the 2016 census, an increasing number of residents (15%) <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no religion - a higher rate of increase and a higher overall percentage than the national average (10%).|$|E
25|$|The USAF's Project Blue Book files {{indicate}} that approximately 1% of all unknown reports came from amateur and professional astronomers or other users of telescopes (such as missile trackers or surveyors). In 1952, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, then {{a consultant to}} Blue Book, conducted a small survey of 45 fellow professional astronomers. Five reported UFO sightings (about 11%). In the 1970s, astrophysicist Peter A. Sturrock conducted two large surveys of the AIAA and American Astronomical Society (AAS). About 5% of the members polled <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> had UFO sightings.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} number of people eliminated however appeared to be during the Viet Cong retreat from the city. They were usually shot and buried in well-concealed mass graves that were eventually to yield some 2,800 corpses. Lack of visible wounds on some bodies, including 2 Catholic priests, <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been buried alive. The 2,800 bodies in Hue {{were part of a}} larger group of some 5,800 civilians in the city targeted in Viet Cong attacks for liquidation or abduction.

He also claimed that his findings supported the World Ice Theory, which claimed that the universe originated from a cataclysmic clash between gigantic balls of ice and glowing mass. Arthur Posnansky had been studying a local site called Tiwanaku, which he also believed supported the theory.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{investigation}} into the Jamison family's disappearance <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> probably not vanished of their own accord.

The Jamisons' bodies were not found, but their dog was still in the truck. The dog was malnourished after days of going without food or water. Police also discovered the Jamisons' IDs, wallets, mobile phones, a GPS system, and about $32,000 in cash. The Jamisons were known for carrying large amounts of cash with them.|$|E
