5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black or black-and-white birds, with long wings and deeply forked tails.

Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft {{for more than a}} week.|$|E
40|$|The idea {{of fabric}} <b>inflatables</b> {{has been around}} for many years and the {{applications}} for them are numerous. <b>Inflatables</b> ranging from hot air balloons and air ships to structural air beams and space suits, all present interesting design challenges.

North Carolina requires amusements rides, including <b>inflatables,</b> to be inspected annually by the North Carolina Department of Labor (NCDOL). [...] For <b>inflatables</b> to pass inspection, operators in North Carolina are required to have all training records, a current certificate of insurance, and device manuals. <b>Inflatables</b> that are damaged and not safe will not pass inspection until they are repaired.|$|R

5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and <b>inflatable</b> boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E

50|$|Since series 5, {{physical}} games {{featuring a}} quiz were scrapped, so general knowledge was only {{tested in the}} quiz rounds (i.e. games that did not involve <b>inflatables).</b> The games involved larger and more complex <b>inflatables</b> and other equipment.|$|R
5|$|Also in 2003, The Rolling Stones {{performed}} in Singapore {{as part of}} their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two <b>inflatable</b> dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organizer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{helicopters}} {{were not}} used in Mozambique {{to the same extent}} as they were in Vietnam, the Alouette III was the most widely used, although the Puma was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for air support the T6 and the Fiat G.91 were used; for reconnaissance, the Dornier Do 27. In the transport role, the Portuguese Air Force used mainly the Nord Noratlas and the C-47. The Portuguese Navy also made extensive use of patrol boats, landing crafts, and <b>inflatable</b> Zodiacs.|$|E
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of <b>inflatable</b> soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E

The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large <b>inflatable</b> marks are used of open events.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an <b>inflatable</b> lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced with conventional suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E

5|$|In the People's Republic of China, {{members of}} the People's Liberation Army {{assisted}} in search and rescue operations. Officials called for about 100,000 citizens in Shanghai for work in disaster control and distribution of relief aid, with some providing relief supplies to flooded areas by <b>inflatable</b> rafts. Within a month, Typhoons Talim and Khanun also affected the same area, further compounding the effects of Matsa. During the 38th Session of the World Meteorological Organization in Hanoi, Vietnam, the name Matsa was retired; during the next session, the name Pakhar was nominated as its replacement. It was first used in the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Surgical implants, {{either of}} {{flexible}} rods or <b>inflatable</b> tubes, {{are reserved for}} when other methods fail {{because of the potential}} for serious complications, which occur in as many as 10% of cases. They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue (breaking through the skin). Although satisfaction among men who use them is high, if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|TISM {{have used}} a variety of methods to conceal their identities.

Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava, but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose, including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper, silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder, giant foam paintings worn on the head, large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle, fat 'businessman' suits, and eight-foot-high <b>inflatable</b> headpieces among others.|$|E

5|$|The Senior Prom {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to be expendable; however, it was modified to be reusable before testing commenced, with a ballistic parachute and <b>inflatable</b> landing bag located under the fuselage. The aircraft {{is believed to have been}} fitted with folding wings to facilicate carriage by the launching aircraft, and was powered by a single turbofan engine, with the air intake and exhaust being configured in such a manner that the airframe would shield them from the ground, reducing the aircraft's radar and infrared signatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in duckbills, {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been <b>inflatable</b> air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866.

The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an <b>inflatable</b> D Class.|$|E
