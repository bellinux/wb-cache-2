These dumps require environmental stabilization/restoration, through proper revegetation. To achieve this aim, a study was conducted to find the efficacy of Mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), an economically important leguminous crop plant, for re-vegetation. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of different soil amendments such as chemical fertilizer, biocompost, vermicompost, bio-fertilizer and fly-ash in appropriate combination to support vegetation. The physicochemical parameters of the overburden soil sample at the time of experiment and after the harvesting have been analyzed. Plant growth in terms of different parameters was measured. The experimental results indicated that all the combinations were significantly increase plant growth and soil fertility. No significant differences were observed among the combinations. The appropriate combinations would be conducive for greater nutrient uptake by the crop and also would improve the soil health and soil fertility status. According to the finding of this research and regarding economic matters and <b>environmental</b> <b>anxieties,</b> it may be recommended that the appropriate proportion of chemical fertilizer, organic fertilizer, vermicompost, bio-fertilizer and fly ash can be used as a soil amendment and Mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) can be used in revegetation of coal mine dumps.

40|$|Abstract Fast {{food has}} been {{extensively}} criticised for its link to health and environments problems and for its tendency to undermine traditional food cultures. Notwithstanding these aspects, this study questioned the assumption that fast food by definition has negative impact on health, environment and traditional food cultures for three main reasons. Firstly, fast-food restaurants are spreading quickly in the Accra Metropolitan Area (AMA) of Ghana and have become {{an important source of}} urban food. Secondly, fast food in Ghana is undergoing various changes, such as the introduction of healthier food options, use of environmentally friendly packaging and the incorporation of local cultural features. Thirdly, there has been ambiguity in the definition of fast food in existing literature, which is often exclusively built upon practices in Western, modernised countries and hence has determined how fast food is normatively evaluated. Moreover, evidence shows that some of the characteristics of fast food used in these definitions are changing, as well as being perceived differently in various regions or sociocultural settings. Against this background, this thesis sought to clarify what constitutes fast food in Ghanaian restaurants, assess its prevalence and explore its characteristics and relevance for urban food provisioning, health improvement and tourism development. An interdisciplinary and a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to gather data for a restaurant study to assess the availability and characteristics of fast food in the AMA using the cuisine concept as an analytical framework. The same approaches were used to gather data for a consumer study to explain how (i) convenience influences fast-food consumption, (ii) identity influences fast-food consumption and (iii) personal responsibility influences fast-food purchase, consumption and waste disposal decisions. Findings indicated that the core food items present in fast-food restaurants are menu items such as foods generally recognised as fast food (FGRAFF), including fried rice, fried chicken, burgers, pizzas and French fries, as well as common Ghanaian foods such as banku and kelewele. Interestingly, the FGRAFFs have been transformed in several ways mainly by the incorporation of aspects of the Ghanaian food culture. Most people eat fast food because of their desire to save time, mental and physical effort, as well as because of the inherent convenience attributes of fast food. Findings also showed that people consume fast food because of its role in identity formation and expression whereby eating in a fast-food restaurant is a way to be connected with what is new and unique, pleasurable and associated with social interaction and sensory and health values. Strikingly, findings showed that fast-food consumers do not only eat fast food for convenience and identity expression, but that they are also reflective about the health and <b>environmental</b> <b>anxieties</b> that might come along with the social practice of consumption. Therefore, consumers may adopt loyalty or exit strategies as a way of reducing the effects of the health and <b>environmental</b> <b>anxieties</b> on themselves and society as a whole. This study has shown that some consumers would prefer to adopt loyalty strategies, implying that fast food provides some major material, social, cultural and behavioural benefits for these consumers and so they may not choose to curtail their fast-food consumption. Therefore, for nutrition and health intervention programmes to be effective, there is a clear need to adopt more holistic approaches by incorporating material, social, cultural and behavioural aspects of food into formal programmes.  ...|$|R

The Bromyard Team provided comprehensive parenting assessments in care proceedings and safeguarding matters. This research is partly derived from the author‟s own experience and makes use of ethnographic and psychoanalytically informed observations of ordinary day to day work processes in the professional team. The study aims to identify, understand and conceptualize the variety of emotional forces and relationship dynamics that impact on first line managers in social work and social care settings in order to deepen and extend understanding of these demands, and the stresses and conflicts managed by professionals in these roles. The author undertook Management Consultative Interviews (MCIs) with the managers of this service, {{in which they were}} afforded space to think about their roles and detailed field logs of researcher/observer experiences were used to gather data. The emergent data identified four emergent episodes, these were analyzed using aspects of thematic analysis informed by psychoanalytic theory. The overall findings of the study are that the first line manager often finds themselves assailed from all sides: task related anxieties that filter through the front line workers, organisational anxieties and projections that trickle down from above, wider <b>environmental</b> <b>anxieties</b> that rock the stability of services and also impact on more senior staff, personal anxieties and projections that invade the professional space and organisational/systemic anxieties arising from inter-group, cross-boundary role tensions.

As dogs age different behavioural issues occur and in some cases dogs may be relinquished or removed from their working service. Here we analyse a dataset on working guide dogs that were removed from their service between 1994 and 2013. We use the withdrawal reasons as a proxy for the manifestation of undesirable behaviour. More than 7, 500 dogs were in the dataset used, 83 % of which were retired (due to old age) and 17 % were withdrawn for behavioural issues. We found that the main reasons for behaviour withdrawal were <b>environmental</b> <b>anxiety,</b> training, and fear/aggression. Breed and sex had an effect on the odds of dogs being withdrawn under the different reasons. The age at withdrawal for the different withdrawal reasons suggested that dogs were more likely to develop fear/aggression related issues early on, whilst issues related to training could develop at almost any age.

40|$|Five {{studies were}} carried out around {{hazardous}} waste sites in California in which the main route of exposure was to low-level parts per billion concentrations of either gaseous emissions or airborne dust particles. Although there was no evidence suggesting excesses in cancer or birth defects, the total number and the prevalence of many of subjective symptoms were higher in areas near the site than in control neighborhoods. We discuss a number of causal processes that could explain these results. We conclude that a classical toxicological response and mass psychogenic illness are not valid explanations. Recall bias may explain part of the pattern. We present data from situations where stress alone from <b>environmental</b> <b>anxiety</b> has produced a similar magnitude of excess symptoms in populations. The fact that excess symptoms in waste site neighbors is found primarily in those who complain of odors or who are worried about environmental chemicals suggests the possibility that autonomic, stress-mediated mechanisms or behavioral sensitization are active in the genesis of these symptoms. A variety of confounders were controlled for. The hypothesis that chemically "acquired immune deficiency" can cause subtle symptomatology as a prodrome to subsequent serious disease has been raised in testimony at several toxic tort trials about waste sites. Although this hypothesis seems unlikely, particularly at sites such as the ones we studied with low airborne exposures, if true it would have profound regulatory implications...|$|E
40|$|The oceans of {{the world}} are {{regularly}} depicted as under threat from human exploitation with the problem portrayed as being of 2 ̆ 7 global 2 ̆ 7 concern. In a world market characterised by the division of labour, many of those who eat fish do so without directly experiencing the ocean as a domain of productive utility. Rather, their encounters are with representations that depict the 2 ̆ 7 natural 2 ̆ 7 world as an aesthetic object of contemplation, and environmentalist discourses that identify human activities as 2 ̆ 7 threatening marine ecosystems. So prevalent is this experience that tangible institutions, such as state fisheries management bodies, have emerged, acting to reinforce the ontology of this 2 ̆ 7 contemplated 2 ̆ 7 ocean, giving weight to the illusion that humans can, and should, appreciate it only from afar.

40|$|Objective: Concerns about {{environmental}} and technological changes affecting health {{have been shown}} to be associated with symptom reports in cross-sectional studies. We aimed to investigate how worries about modernity affecting health, negative affectivity, and prior symptom complaints influence health complaints after environmental spraying in a prospective study. Methods: Two hundred ninety-two residents of West Auckland completed questionnaires measuring recent symptoms, negative affect, and concerns about the effects of modernity on health before aerial spraying of their neighborhood with Foray 48 B. After spraying, 181 residents (62 %) returned a follow-up questionnaire measuring symptoms, spray-avoidance behavior, and the perceived effect of the spray program on health. Results: The number of symptoms reported after the spray was most closely related to the number of symptoms reported at baseline (0. 40, p. 0001). Higher levels of modern health worries (0. 23, p. 001) and baseline symptoms (0. 17, p. 05) were associated with a higher number of symptoms being attributed to the spray program. Modern health worries also predicted avoidance behavior during the spraying times (0. 32, p. 001) and the belief that the health of participants and the health of their children and pets was affected by the spray (all p. 01).

In the vadose zone, air-water interfaces play key roles in colloid mobilization and transport, but knowledge as to how exactly these interfaces affect colloid transport behavior is still inadequate. This dissertation reports on theoretical and experimental studies of colloid interactions with a moving air-water interface in porous media. The specific objectives of this dissertation were to (1) quantify the effect of advancing and receding air-water interfaces on detachment of colloidal particles from a solid surface, (2) quantify the effect of particle shape on particle detachment from a solid surface by a moving air-water interface, and (3) determine the effect of capillary fringe fluctuations on the behavior of colloidal particles. The major results of this work showed that air-water interfaces play a dominant role in colloid detachment surfaces. Advancing interfaces are more important in removing colloids from a stationary surface than are receding interfaces. Colloid shape affects how air-water interfaces can get pinned and angular particles are significantly better removed by moving air-water interfaces than spherical, smooth particles. These findings also apply to porous media, i. e., capillary fringe phenomena. Department of Soil Science, Washington State Universit...|$|E

40|$|This review {{poses the}} question, is it {{possible}} to prevent the development of anxiety disorders through selective interventions? The article begins with a review of the major psychosocial risk factors for anxiety disorders. Evidence is reviewed to support the role of inhibited temperament, parent <b>anxiety,</b> <b>environmental</b> support of avoidant coping, and vicarious and instructional learning of avoidance as risks for anxiety. It is argued that the central focus of these risks is an inhibited temperament and that the other risk factors are likely to be both moderated and mediated by this temperamental style. Thus, a clear option for prevention would be to modify early inhibition. Some preliminary data are presented from the Macquarie University Preschool Intervention Project, a longitudinal study of a brief parent education program for the reduction of inhibited temperament in preschool children.

The present trial aimed to examine whether fluoxetine added to standard therapy for Crohn’s disease [CD] maintained remission, improved quality of life [QoL] and/or mental health in people with CD as compared to placebo. Methods: A parallel randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted. Participants with clinically established CD, with quiescent or only mild disease, were randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine 20 mg daily or placebo, and followed for 12 months. Participants provided blood and stool samples and completed mental health and QoL questionnaires. Immune functions were assessed by stimulated cytokine secretion [CD 3 /CD 28 stimulation] and flow cytometry for cell type. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare groups. Results: Of the 26 participants, 14 were randomized to receive fluoxetine and 12 to placebo. Overall, 14 [54 %] participants were male. The mean age was 37. 4 [SD= 13. 2] years. Fluoxetine had no effect on inflammatory bowel disease activity measured using either the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [F(3, 27. 5) = 0. 064, p= 0. 978] or faecal calprotectin [F(3, 32. 5) = 1. 08, p= 0. 371], but did have modest effects on immune function.

The survey was designed using a three-stage cluster sampling plan; 4026 households were randomly selected. Selected households were visited, and residents were given an initial eligibility screening questionnaire. Eligible participants were asked to schedule an appointment at an NYC-HANES 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cdedicated health center to complete the NYC HANES. A completed survey was defined as completion of a demographic interview and at least one examination component. Health conditions examined included cholesterol levels, diabetes status, blood pressure, <b>environmental</b> biomarkers, depression, <b>anxiety,</b> and antibodies to infectious diseases. ResultsOf the 4026 households approached, eligibility screening questionnaires were completed for 3388 (84...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{explored}} psychosocial and 2 ̆ 2 environmental 2 ̆ 2 {{correlates of}} childhood anxiety disorders. The study examined relationships among parental psychiatric symptomatology, perceived family environment, temperament, and self-competence {{in children with}} a DSM-III-R anxiety disorder. METHOD: A community sample of third through sixth graders was screened initially for symptoms of test anxiety. Those with high and low scores were administered the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children. Three groups (childhood anxiety disorder, test-anxious only, and normal controls) were identified and compared on the psychosocial variables. RESULTS: Children with an anxiety disorder had greater impairment on the indices of perceived self-competence and temperamental flexibility than controls, with the test-anxious children showing intermediate, yet significant, levels of disturbance. There was a trend for children with an anxiety disorder to describe their families as less promoting of independence than the other groups. Finally, measures of parental psychiatric symptomatology revealed more obsessive-compulsive symptoms for the fathers of both the anxiety disorder and test-anxious children compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Results are consistent with previous findings suggesting the familial transmission of anxiety disorders and recent speculations regarding a relationship between behavioral inhibition, <b>environmental</b> control, and <b>anxiety.</b> Further research may isolate psychosocial and family environmental factors as instrumental treatment targets {{in the management of}} childhood anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Cognitive {{impairment}} and anxiety disorders {{are the two}} most common psychiatric disorders in later life. These problems commonly co-occur and are associated with a range of negative outcomes such as increased functional impairment, greater healthcare utilization, and elevated risk of nursing home placement. Little research has examined the stability of genetic influences on anxiety symptoms in older adults. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of the relationship between cognitive performance and anxiety as well as the extent to which shared genetic factors explain this association is unclear. The specific goals of this dissertation were to (1) explore the stability of genetic and <b>environmental</b> influences on <b>anxiety</b> in older adulthood, (2) explore the extent to which genetic factors influencing anxiety are also influencing cognitive performance, (3) determine the temporal dynamics of this phenotypic association, and (4) examine the extent to which genetic and environmental factors were driving this association over time. Design : We examined data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). Between the years 1984 - 2007, 2, 018 participants aged 31 - 98 years completed as many as 7 assessments which included measures of anxiety and cognitive performance. For aim 1, genetic simplex models were fit to examine the stability of genetic and <b>environmental</b> influences on <b>anxiety</b> later in life. For the second aim bivariate Cholesky decompositions were conducted to examine the extent to which shared genetic influences explained the association between anxiety and cognitive performance. For aim 3 we examined the temporal dynamics of the association between anxiety and cognitive performance by fitting bivariate dual change score models (DCSM). For the last aim biometric DCSM models were estimated to examine the temporal dynamics of genetic and environmental contributions. Results : New genetic contributions to the etiology of anxiety were found beginning at the ages 60 - 64. New significant unique environmental factors contributed to anxiety symptoms starting after age 70. For aim 2, in males anxiety was associated with worse nonverbal memory, attention, working memory, and aspects of spatial performance. Anxiety was only associated with worse visuospatial performance and picture memory in females. For males, shared genetic factors were mostly explaining this association. For females unique environmental factors were explaining this association. When examining this association over time, across all cognitive tests worse cognitive performance was a leading indicator of change in anxiety. Anxiety was not associated with subsequent changes in cognitive performance. The biometric models suggested that genetic factors contributing to variance in processing speed and attention were driving variation in anxiety over time. Unique environmental contributions to spatial abilities were driving subsequent variation in anxiety. Conclusions : The findings from these four studies deepen our understanding of the etiology of late life anxiety and its association with cognitive performance. This information can help to identify older adults at risk for the development of anxiety. The findings from this study also may inform intervention and prevention efforts for older adults experiencing cognitive decline and anxiet...|$|R
40|$|Background: Anxieties, such as shyness, noise phobia and {{separation}} anxiety, are common but poorly understood behavioural problems in domestic dogs, Canis familiaris. Although {{studies have demonstrated}} genetic and <b>environmental</b> contributions to <b>anxiety</b> pathogenesis, {{better understanding of the}} molecular underpinnings is needed to improve diagnostics, management and treatment plans. As a part of our ongoing canine anxiety genetics efforts, this study aimed to pilot a metabolomics approach in fearful and non-fearful dogs to identify candidate biomarkers for more objective phenotyping purposes and to refer to potential underlying biological problem. Methods: We collected whole blood samples from 10 fearful and 10 non-fearful Great Danes and performed a liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) -based non-targeted metabolite profiling. Results: Non-targeted metabolomics analysis detected six 932 metabolite entities in four analytical modes [RP and HILIC; ESI(-) and ESI(+) ], of which 239 differed statistically between the test groups. We identified changes in 13 metabolites (fold change ranging from 1. 28 to 2. 85) between fearful and non-fearful dogs, including hypoxanthine, indoxylsulfate and several phospholipids. These molecules are involved in oxidative stress, tryptophan and lipid metabolisms. Conclusions: We identified significant alterations in the metabolism of fearful dogs, and some of these changes appear relevant to anxiety also in other species. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the non-targeted metabolomics and warrants a larger replication study to confirm the role of the identified biomarkers and pathways in canine anxiety...|$|R
40|$|The {{coevolution}} {{of microorganisms}} and their hosts {{have resulted in}} the formation of symbiotic relationships between both organisms. These formed associations have in turn benefited larger animals by enhancing their adaption towards external environments and protecting against pathogens. Recent studies have further highlighted the importance of microbial interactions by analyzing their role in proper immune regulation and their effect on behavior and health. Faulty immunoregulatory circuits have been implicated in the rapid rise of chronic inflammatory diseases and considered a risk factor for psychiatric diseases. Although studies have begun to understand the link between microbes and stress-related behaviors, few studies have focused on the potential influence of <b>environmental</b> bacteria on <b>anxiety</b> related disorders. In this study we show that rats that were subcutaneously immunized with heat–killed M. vaccae, a non-pathogenic environmental bacterium, expressed reduced levels of anxiety-related behaviors when tested in the elevated T-maze. As compared to the control group, M. vaccae-treated rats expressed significantly lower latencies when measuring inhibitory avoidance, a behavior related to generalized-anxiety. During the escape task, a behavior associated with panic behavior, M. vaccae treated rats had larger latencies to leave the open arm, but the differences between groups were not significant. The results of our studies suggest a beneficial effect of heat-killed M. vaccae on anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated T-maze. Our study supports the on-going hypothesis regarding the beneficial role of immunoregulatory environmental microbes in control of emotional behavior and emotional states...|$|R
40|$|Math anxiety {{has been}} defined by Richardson and Suinn (1972) as “unpleasant feelings, specifically, those of tension and anxiety that impede an individual’s ability to {{manipulate}} numbers and solve math problems {{in a variety of}} situations (pg. 551). ” Although previous research has investigated the situational factors (e. g., language and symbols used in math) of math anxiety, little research has examined dispositional and environmental factors. The current study assessed both dispositional (i. e., the Big Five Personality traits) and environmental factors (i. e., different kinds of math experiences) associated with math anxiety. A total of 131 undergraduate students (34 males and 96 females; Mage = 20. 81) completed paper and pencil measures of math anxiety, a personality measure of the Big Five Personality traits, a new measure specifically designed to explore different kinds of math experiences, and measures of general anxiety and test anxiety. Results showed a significant positive relationship between math anxiety and neuroticism, but this relationship became non-significant after controlling for general anxiety and test <b>anxiety.</b> <b>Environmental</b> factors including support in high school, the manner by which math is taught (e. g., giving students plenty of examples), and doing well at math (e. g., having good marks in math) were significantly related to the level of math anxiety experienced by students even after controlling for general and test anxiety. The implications of these findings for better understanding which individuals may be at risk for developing math anxiety are discussed, in addition to the creation of programs and tutorials to decrease math anxiety...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the last}} two decades Bogota, Colombia has seen a massive influx of {{internally}} displaced people (IDP) settling in its periphery where residents face the worst living, social, and economic conditions despite the 2011 passing of The Victims Law entitling IDP victims access to free shelter, food, education, and healthcare. Objective: To understand the circumstances and health care needs of Colombian IDPs, determine trends of health perceptions among IDPs and assess and quality of health services among IDPs in Bogota. Methods: Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 professionals who work with IDPs and 36 IDPs. Interviews explored opinions of common health conditions and barriers to access health services in IDP communities. The EQ- 5 D survey about perceptions of health was administered measuring mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain, and depression/anxiety. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded for analysis. Results: Most IDPs did not indicate suffering with mobility, self-care, and ability to conduct daily activities. Seventy-five percent of participants indicated moderate to severe pain and 86. 85 % expressed feeling some form of depression or <b>anxiety.</b> <b>Environmental</b> factors are common contributors to poor health conditions. Individual and societal factors surfaced as detriments to accessing health services. The process to be included in The Victims Law registry is arduous. Although the Victims Law allows IDPs to access health services, many missing links in the system thwart quality health care delivery and discourage IDPs to utilize the health care system. Conclusion: Despite efforts to mitigate the struggles IPDs suffer there remain much needed health services and organizational improvements for the IDP community in Bogota...|$|R
40|$|Anhedonia {{associated}} with a dysphoric state is an important feature of amphetamine withdrawal in humans. We aimed to investigate the effects of amphetamine withdrawal on two motivation-related behaviors in mice: novelty seeking and <b>environmental</b> habituation. Because <b>anxiety</b> can interfere with the behavioral outcome of other tasks, amphetamine-withdrawn mice were also evaluated in the elevated plus maze. Swiss male mice (three months old) were treated with 2. 0 mg/kg amphetamine for 13 days, every other day, in their home cages (a total of seven injections). Twenty-four hours after withdrawal from drug treatment, mice were tested in a free-choice novelty apparatus containing one familiar and one novel compartment or in the elevated plus maze. Novelty-seeking behavior was assessed by comparing the {{time spent in the}} novel compartment vs. the familiar compartment, whereas environmental habituation was concomitantly evaluated by the time-response curve of total locomotion (novel + familiar). Novelty seeking was decreased during amphetamine withdrawal, and this result was not {{associated with}} changes in the anxiety-like behavior of mice. Additionally, amphetamine withdrawal enhanced environmental habituation. the concomitant decrease in novelty seeking and the increase in environmental habituation seem to be related to amphetamine withdrawal-induced anhedonia. Thus, the model proposed here {{could be used as a}} tool for the study of mechanisms and potential treatment of the anhedonic behavioral consequences of psychostimulant withdrawal.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that genetic factors {{play an important role}} in anxiety disorders. In support, human genome-wide association studies have implicated several novel candidate genes. However, illumination of such genetic factors involved in anxiety disorders has not resulted in novel drugs over the past decades. A complicating factor is the heterogeneous classification of anxiety disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) and diverging operationalization of anxiety used in preclinical and clinical studies. Currently, there is an increasing focus on the gene-environment interaction in anxiety as genes do not operate in isolation and environmental factors have been found to significantly contribute to the development of anxiety disorders in at-risk individuals. Nevertheless, extensive research on gene-environment mechanisms in anxiety has not resulted in major breakthroughs in drug discovery. Modification of individual genes in rodent models has enabled the specific study of anxiety in preclinical studies. In this context, two extensively studied neurotransmitters involved in anxiety are the GABA and 5 -HT system. In this review, we illustrate the complex interplay between genes and environment in anxiety processes by reviewing preclinical and clinical studies on the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT), 5 -HT 1 A receptor, 5 -HT 2 receptor and GABAA receptor. Even though targets from the serotonin and GABA system have yielded drugs with known anxiolytic efficacy, the relation between the genetic background of these targets and anxiety symptoms and development of anxiety disorders is largely unknown. The aim of this review is to show the vast complexity of genetic and <b>environmental</b> factors in <b>anxiety</b> disorders. In light of the difficulty with which common genetic variants are identified in anxiety disorders, animal models with translational validity may aid in elucidating the neurobiological background of these genes and their possible...|$|R
