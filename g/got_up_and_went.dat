25|$|One {{day during}} our lunch {{hour in the}} last week of filming, the craft service man handed out slices of {{watermelon}} to each of us. Richard, the whole camera crew, and I sat together in a big sound studio eating a number of watermelon slices, talking and joking. As a gag, some members of the crew used a piece of watermelon as a Frisbee, and tossed it back and forth to each other. One piece of watermelon landed at Richard's feet. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> home. Filming stopped. The next day, Richard announced that he knew very well what the significance of watermelon was. He said that he was quitting show business and would not return to this film. The day after that, Richard walked in, all smiles. I wasn't privy to all the negotiations that went on between Columbia and Richard's lawyers, but the camera operator who had thrown that errant piece of watermelon had been fired that day. I assume now that Richard was using drugs during Stir Crazy.|$|E
500|$|Henderson, who {{had fallen}} behind the net, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{to the front of}} the net where he was uncovered. Henderson {{recovered}} the rebound of Esposito's shot, shot the puck and was stopped, but recovered the rebound. With Tretiak down, he put the puck past Tretiak with only 34 seconds to play. Foster Hewitt's voice rose in excitement as he called the winning goal: ...|$|E
2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. Then {{he thought that the}} people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If you'd talked {{that way}} last night, Mrs. Lecks," [...] exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "I'd never slept till after sun-up, <b>and</b> then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> huntin' round among them frocks and {{petticoats}} to find somethin' {{that would fit}} me, with the quiet pulse I did have, Mrs. Lecks!" ...|$|R
60|$|My mother <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>and</b> kissed Lettie fervently.|$|R
2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, whistled and drummed, then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|E
60|$|Martin, meanwhile, {{having been}} {{thoroughly}} aroused, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> towards the fire.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 2012, entitled My GetUp has <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> journalist Ben Birchall postulates as to why GetUp! campaigns have not [...] "resonated" [...] for him and concludes, [...] "GetUp's arrival was {{a breath of fresh air}} on the political landscape. It might be our fault, but it seems to have gone stale".|$|R
60|$|Budd {{showed a}} surly disregard, {{but the other}} two bandits <b>got</b> <b>up</b> willingly <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|R
60|$|Lord St. Maurice made {{no sign of}} recognition. On the contrary, {{he turned}} his head away, preferring not to be seen. His nerves were already highly strung, and there seemed to him to be {{something}} ominous in this second meeting with the Sicilian. If he could have been sure of being able to do so unnoticed, he would have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> into the hotel.|$|R
60|$|A {{second man}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and {{drinking}} near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out.|$|E
60|$|Nelson <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{to where}} the boatâ€™s crew were sitting after having {{finished}} their meal.|$|E
60|$|Peterson nodded. Two {{more men}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out. The Captain drank some water and sighed.|$|E
60|$|Lord Valleys also <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>went</b> out together, leaving Barbara, who had risen, looking doubtfully at the door.|$|R
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the window. And {{when she}} turned to him again, it was with {{something}} of the old bravado.|$|R
6000|$|... "Asked him!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "You don't mean to {{say that}} you <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early <b>and</b> <b>went</b> around asking people if they were Mohicans!" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the table, {{and felt}} inside the {{pie-dish}} {{again with a}} spoon.|$|E
60|$|Jethro <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} window, {{where he}} stood with his back toward her.|$|E
60|$|John <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} window; he, too, {{had been}} {{affected}} by her face.|$|E
60|$|Next day Mrs Davidson {{was pale}} and tired. She complained of headache, and she looked old and wizened. She told Mrs Macphail that the missionary had not slept at all; he had passed {{the night in a}} state of frightful {{agitation}} and at five had <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> out. A glass of beer had been thrown over him and his clothes were stained and stinking. But a sombre fire glowed in Mrs Davidson's eyes when she spoke of Miss Thompson.|$|R
60|$|My cousin {{fell into}} {{profound}} musings. Then he started, looked about him, saw {{the time by}} his Rathbone clock, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> suddenly <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to bed.|$|R
60|$|Our third boy, again {{coming to}} the rescue, {{explained}} that it roared when it fell down among the rocks. I think some of us had a vague idea {{that it must have}} been a cowardly torrent to make such a noise about a little thing like this; a pluckier torrent, we felt, would have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> on, saying nothing about it. A torrent that roared every time it fell upon a rock we deemed a poor spirited torrent; but the Professor seemed quite content with it.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{suddenly}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to peer at the stranger, poking {{his face}} close to Aaron's face.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Flanders <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{over to the}} fender {{and stroked}} Topaz on the neck behind the ears.|$|E
60|$|So {{before the}} sun rose he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{to the house of}} the Gruagach, who was sitting outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, that is true. If I {{could have}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> to church, I don't know how often I {{should have been}} a bridesmaid. But, if I could have done that, some girls in love might have been jealous of me, and, as it is, no girl is jealous of me. And my pillow would not have been half as ready to put the piece of cake under, as I always find it," [...] she added, turning her face on it with a light sigh, and a smile at her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's {{much more}} than a mere rumour,' remarked the officer. But he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> submissively <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out. The lady turned to Tomassov and said: 'You may stay With me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Sally peered sharply at Willard Stanley, {{first through}} her gold-rimmed glasses {{and then over}} them. Willard {{continued}} to look very innocent. Joyce <b>got</b> <b>up</b> abruptly <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out of the room.|$|R
60|$|Dr Thorne {{had nothing}} more to say, so he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to his patient in the next room.|$|E
60|$|Harry <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the boats, and {{returned}} directly with a joint of meat. Tom {{looked up in}} surprise.|$|E
60|$|Wally <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to the window. Jill could smile safely now, and she did, but {{her voice}} was still grave.|$|E
60|$|Whilst {{they were}} talking Mr. Morris was looking {{steadily}} at the window, <b>and</b> he now <b>got</b> <b>up</b> quietly, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> out of the room. There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on.|$|R
60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> when he <b>went</b> {{down the}} long arcade Adam looked at Kit with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Davenant <b>got</b> <b>up</b> again <b>and</b> <b>went</b> to her; {{drawing off}} her glove {{she felt her}} cheek {{with the back of}} her hand. 'You are ill, you are in a fever. I'm sure that {{whatever}} you said it was very charming.' ...|$|R
