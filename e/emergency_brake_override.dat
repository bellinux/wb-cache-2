Hence, the third car will receive multiple <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning messages. We will show the first car and second car <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning individually in the user interface (Figure  8), because our system uses the vehicle list to identify the car information.|$|R

50|$|On whether braking alone {{may fail}} to stop {{affected}} vehicles, a driver account in the Los Angeles Times claimed that the attempt to stop a 2005 Camry was unsuccessful with both the <b>brake</b> and <b>emergency</b> <b>brake.</b> However, tests of the Camry by Car and Driver in 2009, attempting to use the brakes to stop acceleration of a purposely stuck throttle at 70, 100, and 120 mph, found that the test driver was able to reduce speed to 10 mph in all instances, and in the 70 and 100 mph tests, stop the car completely. The Camry's braking distances with a purposely stuck accelerator were also shorter {{than that of the}} Ford Taurus' regular stopping distance. Car and Driver concluded that, based on their emergency stopping tests, the Camry's brakes could overcome the accelerator in all cases even without a <b>brake</b> <b>override,</b> and that stopping distances with a wide-open throttle were largely indiscernible from regular braking.|$|R
30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning while the front vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes.</b> Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> warning system. Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R

50|$|On February 17, 2010, Neistat {{uploaded}} a video about when, {{and when}} not, {{to use the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> cord on train cars in the New York City Subway. Neistat criticised {{the way that the}} MTA did not make it clear when the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> cord should be pulled. According to the video, one should only use the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> system when the motion of the train poses an imminent threat to life or limb.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety {{announced}} {{the manufacturers of}} 99% of U.S. automobiles had agreed to include automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> systems as a standard feature on virtually all new cars sold in the U.S. by 2022. [...] In Europe there was a related agreement about advanced <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system (AEBS) or autonomous <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> (AEB) in 2012. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has announced {{that this kind of}} system will become mandatory for new heavy vehicles starting in 2015. NHTSA projected that the ensuing acceleration of the rollout of automatic <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> would prevent an estimated 28,000 collisions and 12,000 injuries.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 December 2010, seven {{tourists}} were injured when a train driver triggered the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system by mistake on the Ocean Express tunnel railway at the park.

2500|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel <b>emergency</b> <b>brakes</b> when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> mechanics may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|R

50|$|During the 17 to 26 {{months that}} the <b>emergency</b> <b>braking</b> system was not operating, {{the braking system}} was tested daily, but since the service <b>brake</b> and <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> were tested simultaneously, {{there was no way}} to tell if the <b>emergency</b> <b>brake</b> was {{functioning}} without looking at the brake pads or hydraulic pressure gauges during the test. The test was always performed with the Sinai car traveling uphill, which meant that when the power was cut and the brakes applied (as part of the test), Sinai’s momentum caused the car to continue moving uphill a short distance (slackening the cable) and then to roll back from gravity, jerking the cable tight.|$|R
