40|$|With a {{preliminary}} liquid <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> <b>generator</b> a tension of 70 kV at a current of 0. 1 μA has been reached. The measurements on the streaming current {{have been carried}} out by means of a simple compensation method which allows us to detect currents up from 3 × 10 − 13 A. It is possible to distinguish the contributions of the pure streaming current and the exchange of charge between liquid and tube wall. Measurements have been performed with refined gasoline flowing through a number of brass capillaries varying in length from 15 to 60 mm, in diameter from 0. 5 to 3 mm, and of different cross-section shape, entrance disturbance and wall roughness. It appeared from introductory measurements that a stationary situation may not be reached until after some minutes...|$|E

40|$|The film <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> (2005) is {{a complex}} and powerfully {{threatening}} portrait of queer monstrosity and negativity. Upon its release, the film 2 ̆ 7 s twist ending garnered widespread derision, {{but there is a}} mad method, so to speak, in its insistence on purposeful irreconcilability. This thesis aims to tease out the nuances of <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> 2 ̆ 7 s subversive twist. It examines the makeup and history of the slasher sub-genre of horror, as well as relevant 2 ̆ 7 criticism in the field, in order to locate <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> 2 ̆ 7 s specific contribution. The film presents an image of queer monstrosity that performs what Michael Moon calls sexual disorientation, as well as a profoundly queer disidentification. In its final scenes, the film portrays a vibrant and violent queer sexuality, one that threatens beyond the screen. <b>High</b> <b>Tension</b> figures the terrifying manifestation of queer negativity, proffering a radical threat to the social itself...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The {{objective}} {{of our work}} {{was to determine whether}} there is a difference in fMRI activation between patients with <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (HTG) and those with normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Method. The sample consisted of eight patients with different stages of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (3 females aged 41 – 65 and 5 males aged 40 – 73 years) and eight patients, also with different stages of normal tension glaucoma (6 females aged 53 – 70 and 2 males aged 40 – 52 years). The control group consisted of eight healthy subjects (3 females aged 23 – 46 and 5 males aged 23 – 65 years). All underwent complete ophthalmological examination, including visual field, colour vision, and electrophysiological functions. The results were compared with fMRI images after stimulation with black/white (BW) and blue/yellow (BY) checkerboard and then statistically processed. Results. The authors analyzed the results of published studies on <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> versus normal tension glaucoma in the images obtained by fMRI. They concluded on the basis of electrophysiological examinations that in <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma, damage of the whole visual pathway occurs, starting from retinal ganglion cells up to the visual cortex. In normal tension glaucoma the response of ganglion cells is relatively normal. The pathology is found mainly in the visual pathway. For this reason, the authors carried out fMRI examinations in <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma patients and patients with normal tension glaucoma. They found that advancing stages of <b>high</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma cause progression of fMRI activity decrease. These relations were not observed in normal tension glaucoma cases.
