Under the later systems, the 4DOS/NDOS command processor supports this features as well. Interestingly, floating drives are implemented in the BDOS kernel, not in the command line shell, thus this feature can also be used from within DOS applications when entering directory paths for as long as the application does not parse and split the dirspec for further processing.|$|E

40|$|A warm gas {{thrust vector}} control system was studied to {{optimize}} the injection geometry for a specific engine configuration, and an injection valve was designed capable of meeting the base line requirements. To optimize injection geometry, studies were made to determine the performance effects of varying injection location, angle, port size, and port configuration. Having minimized the injection flow rate required, a warm gas valve was designed to handle the required flow. A direct drive hydraulic servovalve capable of operating with highly contaminated hydraulic fluid was designed. The valve is sized to flow 15 gpm at 3000 psia and the direct <b>drive</b> <b>feature</b> is capable of applying a spool force of 200 pounds. The baseline requirements are the development of 6 deg of {{thrust vector control}} utilizing 2000 F (total temperature) gas for 180 seconds on a 1. 37 million pound thrust engine burning LOX and RP- 1 at a chamber pressure of 250 psia with a 155 inch long conical nozzle having a 68 inch diameter throat and a 153 inch diameter exit...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of {{tracking}} objects in a complex, dynamic scene. The objects are non-rigid and difficult to model geometrically. Their motion is erratic and they change shape rapidly between frames sampled at 30 frames per second. The objects have low spatial resolution, and the video used for tracking was taken with a panning and zooming camera. Finally, the objects are tracked in sequences up to eight seconds long while moving over a complex background. We suggest that conventional tracking methods are unlikely to perform well at tracking small objects in complex environments because they do not use contextual information to <b>drive</b> <b>feature</b> selection. We propose using "closed-world " analysis to incorporate contextual knowledge into low-level tracking. A closed-world is a space-time region of an image where contextual information like the number and type of objects within the region is assumed to be known. Given that knowledge, the region can be analyzed locally using image processing algorithms and "context-specific " features can be selected for tracking. A context-specific feature is one that has been chosen based upon the context to maximize the chance o...|$|E
40|$|So {{far we have}} {{discussed}} interest points and descriptors, but we haven’t really touched upon how they {{will be used to}} retrieve images. For a moment, pretend that we are writing a search engine for text documents. The difference is that with this search engine you enter in an entire document that is like the one you want, and the engine goes through its database looking for matches. How would this engine work? Well, it would pick out particular words from the document you gave it, probably a subset of distinctive nouns and verbs, and look for other documents which had those words. The document which had the most matching words would then be chosen. heart monitor food processor processor monitor memory drive computer processor monitor memory drive memory loss car <b>drive</b> <b>Feature</b> Extraction 3 Matching words Initially, it seems like matching words is simple. Aside from verbs, which have various conjugations, nouns should be easy to match. This isn’t the case, unfortunately. Take, for example, different members of the same class. “dalmation ” and “poodle” are very similar words, as they are both dogs, but don’t look anything alike. Only by looking at their definitions can we match them properly. Thus, both the words from a document and their definitions can be used to find documents from the database which match. It ends up that this simple idea of matching documents based on the words they contain and their definitions carries over remarkably well into the problem of searching images. We are going to use the same technique to match images to images in a database. Interest points will be used as visual words with descriptors as their definitions. What remains is a need of a way to find the synonyms o...|$|E
