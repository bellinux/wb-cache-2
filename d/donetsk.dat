5|$|The Cabinet {{originally}} {{consisted of}} 29 ministers, four {{more than the}} previous government, but has since been trimmed down. At the time of installation the Cabinet contained {{the highest number of}} ministers in Europe, and ranked second in Europe {{in terms of the number}} of its vice premiers. 8 out of the original 29 Cabinet members were born in <b>Donetsk</b> and the <b>Donetsk</b> Oblast.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July 2014, two Su-25s {{were shot}} down in the <b>Donetsk</b> region of Ukraine. A {{spokesperson}} for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine said the aircraft {{were shot down}} by missiles fired from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Two {{roads in}} Sheffield {{have been named}} after sister cities; {{a section of the}} A6102 in Norton is named Bochum Parkway, and a road in Hackenthorpe is named <b>Donetsk</b> Way. Likewise in Bochum, Germany there is a major road called the Sheffield-Ring.|$|E
5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the Donbass were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of Ukraine. A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic autonomy for Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 consultative referendum on various constitutional questions in <b>Donetsk</b> and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, whether Russian should be the language of administration in <b>Donetsk</b> and Luhansk oblasts, whether Ukraine should federalise, and whether Ukraine should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E
5|$|As {{winners of}} the 2008–09 Champions League, Barcelona later played against 2008–09 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> in the 2009 UEFA Super Cup, and they {{represented}} UEFA at the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup. Despite winning the Champions League final, Barcelona won €8million less prize money from the tournament than Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's UEFA {{coefficient}} {{placed them}} in the top eight seeds for the draw, meaning that they would avoid having to play against Internazionale, Liverpool, Chelsea or holders and their semi-final opponents from 2007–08, Manchester United. However, they could still draw Bayern Munich, Roma or Juventus. In the end, Barcelona were drawn into Group C against Sporting CP, Basel and Shakhtar <b>Donetsk.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dortmund {{started off}} their {{campaign}} in the third qualifying of the Champions League round defeating Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> 5–1 over two legs. Borussia needed to win their last group game against Liverpool to have any chance of {{making it to the}} second group stage, but they lost 2–0 and were eliminated from Group B on goal difference, after finishing on the same points as Boavista.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Sergei Khrushchev {{moved to}} the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now <b>Donetsk,</b> Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita {{followed}} later that year, while Ksenia Khrushcheva and her daughter came after. Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and <b>Donetsk</b> in 1961, {{was at the heart}} of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire. After the boy worked briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found him a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory. He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields Massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Rutchenkovo, where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of Pravda. He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to receiving almost €31million in prize money, as {{winners of the}} UEFA Champions League, Barcelona competed in the 2009 UEFA Super Cup, in which they beat 2008–09 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> 1–0 at Stade Louis II in Monaco on 28 August 2009, and in the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, where they beat Estudiantes of Argentina in the final.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{went on to}} win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao, and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> {{becoming}} the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup, thus {{becoming the}} first team ever to accomplish the sextuple. In May 2010, Barcelona won La Liga for the second consecutive time with a record Spanish league tally of 99 points out of 114 possible. In August, Barcelona won their ninth Supercup, beating the previous record of eight, which they shared with Real Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Buffon was {{nominated}} for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or and the 2012 UEFA Team of the Year following his performances throughout the calendar year. He obtained his first Champions League clean sheet, against Nordsjælland, on 7 November, a match which Juve won 4–0 at Juventus Stadium. He also kept clean sheets as Juventus beat defending champions Chelsea 3–0 at home, and Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> 1–0 away from home, on Buffon's 100th club appearance in European competitions. Juventus topped their group undefeated, and advanced to the knockout stages for first time since 2008–09.|$|E
5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona {{on top of their}} group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they could still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia {{have been}} offered by both the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union to join their {{integration}} unions. All three countries opted for the European Union by signing association agreements on 21 March 2014. However, break-away regions of Moldova (Transnistria), Ukraine (<b>Donetsk</b> and Lugansk) and Georgia (South Ossetia and Abkhazia) have {{expressed a desire to}} join the Eurasian Customs Union and integrate into the Eurasian Economic Union.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 2015, in his 100th Champions League appearance, Alonso was sent-off for {{a second}} bookable offense in a 0–0 draw against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk.</b> Alonso was {{suspended}} for the return leg of the fixture, which Bayern won 7–0. Alonso {{would go on to}} record his fourth goal, another free kick, against Porto in the Champions League quarter-final. Bayern would go on to win 6–1, advancing to the semi-finals for a fourth-straight season on aggregate, 7–4.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 2015, Nani joined Turkish club Fenerbahçe, {{signing a}} three-year deal for a £4.25million {{transfer}} fee. He {{and his former}} United teammate Robin van Persie debuted 22 days later in a goalless home draw against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> in the third qualifying round of the season's Champions League, with Nani starting. He scored two goals including the winner, a free-kick in second-half stoppage time, against Antalyaspor on 30 August.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco scored {{his first}} career UEFA Champions League goal against FC Nordsjælland on 7 November, a match which Juventus won 4–0 at Juventus Stadium. He scored the third goal as Juventus beat {{defending}} champions Chelsea 3–0 at home, and {{also contributed to}} Juventus' 1–0 away win against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> which allowed Juventus to top their group undefeated and advance to the knockout stages for {{first time since the}} 2008–09 tournament. On 1 December, Giovinco scored his fifth league goal of the season in the Derby della Mole against Torino, also recording an assist on one of Claudio Marchisio's two goals in a 3–0 victory at home.|$|E
5|$|O'Dea {{began his}} career on the youth team of Celtic, with whom he played from 2006 to 2012. During his time on Celtic, he was loaned to Reading, Ipswich Town and Leeds United. While playing for Leeds, O'Dea won the Ireland Young International Player of the Year Award. For more first-team {{opportunities}} he switched clubs and countries, joining Toronto FC of Major League Soccer for a year until 2013. The following season, he represented FC Metalurh <b>Donetsk</b> in Ukraine. O'Dea's stint was cut short due to the Ukrainian political situation, and he returned to England with Blackpool. In July 2015, he signed with Indian Super League club Mumbai City FC.|$|E
5|$|Pogba's first {{competitive}} appearance with Juventus {{came in the}} Serie A {{match against}} Chievo on 22 September 2012, where he played the full 90 minutes. On 2 October, Pogba made his first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 home draw against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> and on 20 October, Pogba scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Napoli. On 31 October, he started against Bologna and scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 victory. Pogba {{also contributed to the}} opening goal scored by Fabio Quagliarella. The midfielder was subsequently praised for his performance in the match by several Italian media outlets such as la Repubblica, Il Messaggero and La Gazzetta dello Sport.|$|E
5|$|Sevilla {{holds the}} record for the most victories, having won the {{competition}} five times since its inception. Real Madrid (winners in 1985 and 1986) and Sevilla (winners in 2006 and 2007; and in 2014, 2015, and 2016) are the only teams to have retained their title. Teams from Spain have won the competition the most times, with ten winners coming from the country. The last champions before the UEFA Cup was renamed to UEFA Europa League were Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> who beat Werder Bremen 2–1 after extra time in the 2009 final. Benfica have lost the most finals, with three losses in the competition. The current champions are Manchester United, who defeated Ajax 2–0 in the 2017 final.|$|E
5|$|Spurred on by this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series of {{follow-up}} offensives in January and February 1943 intended to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of the}} remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of <b>Donetsk.</b> Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. To deal with this threat, Army Group Don, Army Group B, and parts of Army Group A were united as Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{was sent}} off for {{receiving}} two yellow cards against Manchester United on 28 October 2012, the second for diving, leaving Chelsea with nine men after teammate Branislav Ivanović was also sent off; the team {{went on to}} lose 3–2. Torres scored his first goal in the Champions League for the season after deflecting Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov's clearance into goal, as Chelsea needed a 94th-minute winner from Victor Moses to secure a 3–2 victory on 7 November 2012. On 21 November 2012, Roberto Di Matteo was replaced as Chelsea manager by Rafael Benítez, who had previously coached Torres at Liverpool. It was reported that one reason for Benítez's appointment was to help Torres return to his best form.|$|E
5|$|After the 2013–14 season, Müller {{signed a}} new {{contract}} keeping him at Bayern until 2019 and rejected a contract offer from Manchester United. Müller played in the DFL-Supercup, which was Bayern's first match in the 2014–15 season. Bayern lost the match 2–0. His first goal of the season was against Preußen Münster in the DFB-Pokal on 17 August 2014. Then in the opening match of the Bundesliga, on 22 August 2014, Müller scored the opening goal of Bayern's Bundesliga season against VfL Wolfsburg. Bayern {{went on to win}} the match 2–1. On 11 March 2015, Müller scored two goals against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> in a 7–0 win to draw level with former teammate Mario Gómez as the top-scoring German player in UEFA Champions League history. He subsequently became the leader when he scored in a 6–1 win against Porto on 21 April 2015. He finished the season with 13 goals in 32 league matches, a goal in five DFB-Pokal matches, and seven goals in ten Champions League matches.|$|E
5|$|Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, {{winning the}} {{competition}} for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions. Barça finished the season by beating the previous year's Champions League winners Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team {{went on to win}} the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup. Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.|$|E
5|$|Nasri {{continued}} his fine form as season wore on. In the club's Champions League group stage tie against Serbian club Partizan, he assisted on a Sébastien Squillaci {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 victory. In October 2010, Nasri went on a streak in which he scored goals in three-straight matches. He started the streak by converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. In the club's following match, against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> Nasri scored on a left-footed volley in a 5–1 victory. He also assisted on a goal in the match. Against Manchester City five days later, he scored the first goal {{and set up the}} third in a 3–0 victory.

5|$|On 21 August 2010, Chamakh scored {{his first}} Premier League goal with a header against Blackpool. In the same match, {{he won a}} penalty when he was fouled by Ian Evatt, which Andrey Arshavin {{subsequently}} converted in a 6–0 win for Arsenal. In his third start in four games, Chamakh scored the team's second goal against Bolton Wanderers in a 4–1 victory. On 15 September, in his first Champions League match for the club, he scored the third goal in a 6–0 win against Portuguese club Braga. Two weeks later, Chamakh scored his second Champions League goal for Arsenal against Serbian outfit Partizan. The goal was his seventh goal in eight Champions League matches.

The previous record was held by Thierry Henry, who scored a goal after 58seconds for Arsenal against Reading on 22 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} {{game in which}} Atlético participated was against Yale for the 1915 Campeonato Mineiro, which the team won 5–0. The biggest victory ever recorded by Galo was 13–0, against Calafate in the 1927 Campeonato Mineiro. In the national league, the biggest win came against Desportiva Ferroviária — 7–1 in the 1982 season. Atlético's biggest win in the Copa do Brasil, 11–0 against Caiçara in 1991, is also the competition's record victory.

The record attendance in official matches is 113,749, achieved in a match against Santos for the 1983 Brasileirão. Atlético holds the Brazilian record for longest unbeaten run at home, with 54 matches from 2011 to 2013. The signing of André from Dynamo Kyiv in 2012 is the club's most expensive purchase, costing around €8 million, while the record sale is the transfer of Bernard to Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> in 2013, which cost the Ukrainian club €25 million.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a {{guaranteed}} starter for the B team, playing 17 games {{throughout the campaign}} and scoring on six occasions. Since his debut the previous November, {{he had not been}} called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute player, he played only 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar <b>Donetsk.</b> He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league {{for the first time in}} six years.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Donetsk</b> is the {{administrative}} {{centre of the}} <b>Donetsk</b> Oblast (province), the city is {{the capital of the}} <b>Donetsk</b> City Municipality. However, <b>Donetsk</b> is a city of oblast subordinance, thus being subject directly to the oblast authorities rather to the <b>Donetsk</b> City Municipality housed in the city itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Donetsk</b> is home {{to about}} 140 museums. Among them, two large {{regional}} museums – <b>Donetsk</b> Region History Museum and <b>Donetsk</b> Regional Art Museum.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>Donetsk</b> Oblast is an {{important}} transport hub in Ukraine, so is its centre <b>Donetsk.</b> The <b>Donetsk</b> Railways, based in <b>Donetsk,</b> {{is one of the}} largest railway divisions in the country. It serves the farming and industrial businesses of the area, and the populations of the <b>Donetsk</b> and Luhansk oblasts and parts of the Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Kharkiv oblasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} sport in <b>Donetsk</b> is football. <b>Donetsk</b> {{is the home}} to three major {{professional}} football clubs: Shakhtar <b>Donetsk,</b> which plays at the Donbass Arena (previously at the Shakhtar Stadium and the RSC Olimpiyskiy), Metalurh <b>Donetsk,</b> which plays at the Metalurh Stadium, and FC Olimpik <b>Donetsk.</b> All three play in the Ukraine Premier League. Shakhtar <b>Donetsk</b> won the Ukrainian Championship and Ukrainian Cup multiple times, and in 2009 they became the second team from Ukraine (after FC Dynamo Kyiv) to win a European competition, the UEFA Cup. <b>Donetsk</b> {{is also home to}} the women's football club WFC Donchanka, {{one of the most successful}} clubs in the history of the Ukrainian Women's League.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1936, the <b>Donetsk</b> Opera and Ballet Theatre, is a gem of a theatre with {{an elegant}} {{exterior}} and world-class performances inside. <b>Donetsk</b> {{is the home}} to the <b>Donetsk</b> Ballet company since 1946.|$|E
25|$|After the disgraced President Yanukovych {{abandoned}} Ukraine for Russia, Russian backed provocateurs {{took over}} the main government building in <b>Donetsk.</b> The police did not offer resistance. Later in the week the authorities of <b>Donetsk</b> denounced the referendum {{on the status of}} the region and the police retook the <b>Donetsk</b> Oblast administrative building. <b>Donetsk</b> became one of the centers of the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The other rivalry {{was with}} Metalurh <b>Donetsk</b> was local and, {{although}} not as significant as games against the rivals from the capital, the games between the two <b>Donetsk</b> teams were proclaimed the <b>Donetsk</b> Derby. Metalurh went bankrupt in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Donetsk</b> is {{also the}} home of the Prokofiev <b>Donetsk</b> State Music Academy, a music {{conservatory}} founded in 1960.|$|E
