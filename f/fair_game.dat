5|$|After {{years as}} a {{struggling}} actress, Watts came to attention in David Lynch's psychological thriller Mulholland Drive (2001). The following year she enjoyed box-office success with her role as Rachel Keller in The Ring (2002), the remake of a successful Japanese horror film. She then received nominations at the Academy Awards and the Screen Actors' Guild Awards in the Best Actress categories for her portrayal of Cristina Peck in Alejandro González Iñárritu's neo-noir 21 Grams (2003). Her subsequent films include David O. Russell's comedy I Heart Huckabees (2004), the 2005 remake of King Kong, the crime-thriller Eastern Promises (2007) and the Tom Tykwer-directed thriller The International (2009). Since then, Watts has portrayed Valerie Plame Wilson in the biographical drama <b>Fair</b> <b>Game</b> (2010) and Helen Gandy in Clint Eastwood's biographical drama J. Edgar (2011). For her leading role as Maria Bennett in the disaster film The Impossible (2012), she received second nominations for the Academy Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.|$|E

We study the influence of age and mathematical ability on the percentage of correct responses. Interviews with {{a small sample of}} pupils serve to describe children's conceptions of <b>fair</b> <b>games.</b> 1. BACKGROUND The concept of probability may be developed through games and experiments with dice, coins or spinners, which help children in acquiring concepts such as chance, independence and mutually exclusive events (Amit, 1998). Games of chance are one major context where children meet random situations, becoming aware of their unpredictability and realising the need for probabilistic estimates. These games form part of children's culture outside of school, and, as Peard (1990) showed, make children acquire probabilistic knowledge, even before any formal instruction on the topic. The study of children's conceptions about <b>fair</b> <b>games</b> has recently increased...|$|R

The standard compass found in Wanted is replaced by directional arrows based on proximity, that grow to become arcs {{around the perimeter of}} the compass as other players near, and will eventually create a full circle when other players are very close. As in other modes, the player with the highest score at the end of the session is the winner.|$|E

In the fourth quarter, Neely hit Bomar with a 23-yard pass and Bomar ran for 20 yards more, close to the goal. Reese ran it in on the next play and the field goal was good, giving the Commodores a 20–10 victory.|$|E

40|$|An Astumian game {{is defined}} by a finite Markov chain with state space S with {{precisely}} two absorbing states, the winning and the losing state. The other states are transient, {{one of them is}} the starting position. The game is said to be losing (respectively fair respectively winning) if the probability to be absorbed at the winning state is smaller than 0. 5 (respectively = 0. 5 respectively larger than 0. 5). Astumian’s paradox states that there are losing games on the same state space S a stochastic mixture of which is winning. (By “stochastic mixture ” we mean that in each step one decides with the help of a fair coin whether to use the transition probabilities of the first or the second game.) Most of our results concern <b>fair</b> <b>games.</b> Mixtures are systematically investigated. Rather surprisingly, the winning probability of the mixture of <b>fair</b> <b>games</b> can be arbi-trarily close to zero (or to one). Even more counter-intuitive are examples of definitely losing games (this means that the winning probability is exactly zero) such that the winning probability of the mixture is arbitrarily close to one. We show, however, that such extreme examples are possible only if one tolerates huge running times of the game. As a natural generalization one can also consider arbitrary mixtures: the fair coin is replaced by a biased one, with probability λ respectively 1 − λ one plays with the first respectively the second game. It turns out that <b>fair</b> <b>games</b> exist such that – depending on the choice of λ – the λ-mixture can be fair, losing or winning...|$|R
