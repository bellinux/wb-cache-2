5|$|In Petrified Forest National Park, most of {{the logs}} in the park {{retained}} their original <b>external</b> <b>form</b> during petrification but lost their internal structure. However, {{a small fraction of}} the logs and {{most of the}} park’s petrified animal bones have cells and other spaces that are mineral-filled but still retain much of their original organic structure. With these permineralized fossils, it is possible to study the cellular make-up of the original organisms with the aid of a microscope. Other organic matter—typically leaves, seeds, cones, pollen grains, spores, small stems, and fish, insect, and animal remains—have been preserved in the park as compression fossils, flattened by the weight of the sediments above until only a thin film remains in the rock.|$|E

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the <b>external</b> <b>form</b> of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu.

500|$|Botany (Greek [...] - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin [...] – herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, {{the core}} {{disciplines}} of biology whose history is {{closely associated with}} the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, <b>external</b> <b>form,</b> internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the <b>external</b> <b>form</b> of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E

6000|$|... 1. That {{societies}} have no specific <b>external</b> <b>forms.</b> This, however, {{is a point}} of contrast which loses much of its importance, when we remember that throughout the vegetal kingdom, as well as in some lower divisions of the animal kingdom, the forms are often very indefinite--definiteness being rather the exception than the rule; and that they are manifestly in part determined by surrounding physical circumstances, as the forms of societies are. If, too, it should eventually be shown, as we believe it will, that the form of every species of organism has resulted from the average play of the external forces to which it has been subject during its evolution as a species; then, that the <b>external</b> <b>forms</b> of societies should depend, as they do, on surrounding conditions, will be a further point of community.|$|R
2500|$|Entailment {{differs from}} {{implication}} in that whereas {{the latter is}} a binary operation that returns a value in a Boolean algebra, the former is a binary relation which either holds or does not hold. In this sense entailment is an <b>external</b> <b>form</b> of implication, meaning external to the Boolean algebra, thinking of the reader of the sequent as also being external and interpreting and comparing antecedents and succedents in some Boolean algebra. The natural interpretation of [...] is as ≤ in the partial order of the Boolean algebra defined by x ≤ y just when x∨y = y. This ability to mix external implication [...] and internal implication → in the one logic is among the essential differences between sequent calculus and propositional calculus.|$|E
