5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, subsequently packaged with Halo: Combat Evolved DVDs. A real-time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003, {{which was the}} first actual gameplay seen by the public; it showcased new features such as dual-wielding and improved graphics. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the game environments could be. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E

5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, <b>how</b> <b>big</b> its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey {{released}} by the United Nations, in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants.

25|$|Broilers are {{not raised}} in cages. They are raised in large, open {{structures}} known as grow out houses. A farmer receives the birds from the hatchery at one day old. A grow out consist of 5 to 9 weeks according on <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the kill plant wants the chickens to be. These houses {{are equipped with}} mechanical systems to deliver feed and water to the birds. They have ventilation systems and heaters that function as needed. The {{floor of the house}} is covered with bedding material consisting of wood chips, rice hulls, or peanut shells. In some cases they can be grown over dry litter or compost. Because dry bedding helps maintain flock health, most growout houses have enclosed watering systems (“nipple drinkers”) which reduce spillage.|$|E
25|$|Although distinct, these ranks {{were not}} utterly {{exclusive}} castes {{like those of}} India. It was possible to rise or sink from one rank to another. Rising upward could be achieved a number of ways, such as by gaining wealth, by gaining skill in some department, by qualifying for a learned profession, by showing conspicuous valour, or by performing some service to the community. An example of {{the latter is a}} person choosing to become a briugu (hospitaller). A briugu had to have his house open to any guests, which included feeding no matter <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the group. For the briugu to fulfill these duties, he was allowed more land and privileges, but this could be lost if he ever refused guests.|$|E
25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators {{from a great}} distance; it then alerts other prairie dogs of the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a {{sophisticated}} system of vocal communication to describe specific predators. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, <b>how</b> <b>big</b> it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that prairie dogs have calls for things that are not predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.|$|E
