40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{present results}} from cold-laboratory {{observations}} {{of changes in}} isotopic (d 18 O and dD) content by sublimation in snow and ice samples under nearly isothermal conditions. The results show large increases in observed d 18 O and dD in snow samples within several centimeters of the surface. They contradict the assumption of a non-changing isotopic content due to layer-by-layer transport mechanisms driven by sublimation/desublimation processes. The data also {{do not support the}} idea that isotopic changes of snow and <b>firn</b> are <b>limited</b> by the possibility that the ice matrix incorporates the atmospheric water vapor and that forced water-vapor diffusion in the pore space (wind pumping) is a requirement for isotopic content change. The observations show that sublimation from ice samples results in much lower increases in heavy-isotope content in the first several millimetres near the sublimating surface over the same time period, despite sublimation intensities {{similar to those of the}} snow samples. The results suggest that continuous phase transitions inside snow (recrystallization) are the process responsible for the isotopic content change because they are the primary mass-exchange mechanism between the snow mass and the surrounding environment. Modeling the isotopic content of the ice matrix therefore requires inclusion of a two-stage process: fractionation at the ice-matrix surface due to repetitive phase transitions, and fractionation due to preferable diffusion of light water isotopes in the pore space. For interpretation of the observed natural isotopic profiles in snow, the first process can be linked to the time a snow layer undergoes recrystallization, while the second process is related to the total ice/snow mass gain/loss determined by the external environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Compared {{to other}} natural porous materials, {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about the physical nature of polar firn. This intricate network of ice and pore space that comprises the top 60 – 100 m of the polar ice sheets is the framework that forms the natural archive of past climate information. Despite the many implications for ice core interpretation, direct measurements of physical properties throughout the <b>firn</b> column are <b>limited.</b> Models of gas transport through firn are used to interpret in-situ chemical data which is retrieved to analyze past atmospheric composition. These traditional models treat the firn as a "black box," with gas transport parameters tuned to match gas concentrations with depth to known atmospheric histories. Though this method has been largely successful and provided very useful insights, there are still many questions and uncertainties to be addressed. This work seeks to understand the impact of firn structure on gas transport in firn from a first principles standpoint through direct measurements of permeability, gas diffusivity and microstructure. The relationships between gas transport properties and microstructure will be characterized and compared to existing relationships for general porous media. Direct measurements of gas diffusivity are compared to diffusivities deduced from models based on firn air chemical sampling. Our comparison illuminates the primary importance of including microstructural parameters, beyond just porosity or density, in mass transport modeling, and it provides insights about the nature of gas transport throughout the firn column. Guidance is provided for development of next-generation firn air transport models...|$|R
40|$|Climate warming {{can result}} in glacier {{contraction}} {{and changes in the}} coverage of snow, firn, and glacier ice that impact the energy balance and affect the timing and magnitude of streamflow generation. The impact of glacier-climate co-variability on streamflow in Canada’s northern continental regions remains undocumented. This study evaluates changes in glacier snow accumulation, ablation, and hydrological regime with changing climate for the Bologna Glacier in the Ragged Range (Selwyn Mountains) headwaters of the South Nahanni River, Northwest Territories. The Bologna Glacier basin was instrumented in 2014 with two meteorological stations that measured air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and radiation on and off the glacier surface. These short term observations were used to spatially and temporally downscale and bias correct ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) atmospheric reanalyses to construct a meteorological record from 1980 to 2015. Both the rainfall ratio and the average daily maximum summer temperatures were found to be increasing significantly over the study period. Total spring precipitation was found to be decreasing significantly over the time period. The Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM) was used to construct a physically based glacier hydrology model that incorporated a new glacier module: an energy balance snow and ice ablation model coupled with a blowing snow and avalanche model to characterize the mass balance of glacier snow and ice. To set up the model, the Bologna Glacier basin was discretized into Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) representing the spatial distribution of hydrological processes, parameters, and driving meteorology. HRUs were delineated by metrics including elevation, slope, aspect, <b>firn</b> <b>limit,</b> and land cover type, using a digital elevation model and Landsat satellite imagery from 1984 and 2014. Reconstructed meteorological data were used to force the model to run over three decades with the former (1984) and contemporary (2014, 2015) glacier geometry and <b>firn</b> <b>limit</b> configuration to determine the effect of climate warming, reduced glacier cover, and increased ice exposure on headwater streamflow generation, which was found to be substantial. Analysis of satellite imagery showed that the glacier area decreased by 14 % from 1984 to 2014 (30 years) and that firn coverage was reduced from 82 % to 47 % over the same time period. Firn coverage entirely disappeared by 2015, as observed during the field trip in August of that year. There was a shift in CRHM-modelled discharge contribution from substantial firn melt contributions to substantial ice melt contributions between the historical and contemporary model configurations. Results indicate that both annual discharge and ice melt contributions to streamflow increased significantly over the study period. Overall, there was a substantial contribution to streamflow from glacier melt and wastage in all three model configurations. The envelope of annual mass balance was determined to be - 9. 0 m to - 20. 3 m water equivalent. The envelope of modelled summertime wastage contribution to measured streamflow at the Virginia Falls gauge in the South Nahanni River was determined to be 2. 9 to 6. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|Research in 1952 - 54 on Saskatchewan Glacier was {{directed}} toward the measurement of velocity {{on the surface and}} at depth, the surface and bedrock topography, ablation, and structures produced by flow. These field data are used to test current theories of flow and to derive new conclusions about the flow of a valley glacier. Positions in space of 51 velocity stations fixed in the ice were computed from triangulation surveys. Summer velocities are generally greater than yearly velocities. Short interval (1 / 2 -l day) observations recorded great velocity fluctuations and occasional backward movements. Some of these fluctuations represent domains not over 100 feet in extent. Dispersion values indicate that jerkiness is probably due to irregular shearing and is not predominantly perpendicular to crevasses. Dispersion of velocity decreases with increasing time intervals of measurement. Maximum surface velocity of 383 fpy occurs at the firn limit; velocity decreases unevenly along the midglacier line to 12 fpy at the terminus. Velocity vectors plunge below the surface along the centerline from above the <b>firn</b> <b>limit</b> to 1. 3 miles below. Further downglacier the vectors rise out from the surface and the angular divergence increases both downglacier and toward the margins. The flow of ice toward the surface is constant at 10 fpy in the lower 3 miles. Rates of surface lowering computed from these data and ablation data agree roughly with independently measured thinning. Velocity gradients in an area of detailed study are analyzed to determine the surface strain rate field. Deformation is largely caused by the transverse gradient of the longitudinal velocity. Longitudinal and transverse extensions and compressions were measured. One principal strain rate trajectory lies along the flow centerline; a trajectory of maximum shearing strain rate parallels the valley wall at the margin. Velocity to a depth of 140 feet decreases exponentially. The flow law of ice is determined by an analysis of this short vertical profile and a transverse velocity profile on the surface. The two sets of data give consistent results which agree with results from other glaciers, and suggest that the flow law is unaffected by either hydrostatic pressure or extending or compressing flow. The strain rate cannot be expressed as a simple power function of the stress. A viscous-like flow appears to predominate at low stresses. Above a shear stress of 0. 7 bar the flow velocity changes much more rapidly with slight changes in stress. The derived flow law is used to compute velocity as a function of depth and the mass-budget. These results show that the ice currently being supplied to the surface is not as great as the surface ablation but is just sufficient to keep the glacier thinning at an unchanged rate in time. Computed streamlines parallel the bedrock channel closely. Three main classes of features in the ice are distinguished: (1) primary sedimentary layering, (2) secondary flow foliation and (3) secondary cracks and crevasses. Primary stratification is flat-lying in general but wrinkled longitudinally in detail. Foliation generally dips steeply, strikes longitudinally, and shears other structures. However, some foliation attitudes do not relate to measured directions of maximum shearing strain rate at the point of observation or at any conceivable point of origin. The orientation of the most prominent set of cracks agrees approximately with measured trajectories of principal compressing strain rate. Other minor sets of cracks are related to trajectories of maximum shearing strain rate...|$|E
40|$|Vigorous {{attack is}} {{currently}} being made on glacier flow by field studies, laboratory investigations, and theoretical analyses. Knowledge of the physical properties and behavior of ice deep within glaciers remains unsatisfactory, because laboratory experiments do not reproduce the relations of time and temperature existing in the natural environment. It is not yet certain whether ice under long-continued stress in glaciers behaves as a plastic substance of fixed yield stress or as an essentially “viscous” material, {{but it is clear}} that neither the plasticity nor the “viscosity” is constant. This is particularly important in respect to calculations of glacier movement. Current petrofabric studies on glaciers show that earlier ideas of crystallographic orientation in ice were oversimplified. Strong fabric patterns are found, but they cannot be satisfactorily interpreted on the basis of simple gliding on the basal plane parallel to the direction of shear. Fabrics in surface ice may actually be the product of an ordered recrystallization proceeding from an orientation produced by flow deeper in the glacier. Knowledge of relaxation behavior in ice is required, and controlled laboratory work establishing relations of stress, crystallographic orientation, and mechanisms of yield is needed to provide a satisfactory basis for interpretation of the fabric patterns. Among the several possible mechanisms of glacier flow, intracrystalline gliding is currently favored because of strong fabrics in glacier ice. It remains to discover the means by which the favored crystal orientation is produced, to work out the exact nature of intra crystalline yielding, and to explain the lack of grossly elongated crystals in flowing ice. Slipping on the subglacial floor accounts for as much as 90 per cent of the movementof thin ice resting on steep slopes and for as much as 20 – 50 per cent of the movement in some valley glaciers. Intergranular shifting can be the predominant process of flow in firn, and it may be effective in some ice bodies, but for most glaciers it is less significant than intra crystalline gliding. Material transfer associated with changes of state can contribute directly and indirectly to glacier flow. It is probably not of major significance but may have been too greatly discounted in recent years. Discrete displacements along shear planes in glaciers are probably largely surficial. Foliation in glacier ice suggests laminar flow, but this may occur by plastic yielding rather than by mechanical slippage on shear planes. Movement in glaciers is inclined obliquely downward from the surface in the accumulation area and obliquely upward in the ablation zone. This enables the glacier to maintain its thickness and surface profile. In a valley glacier, velocity increases from the head to about the <b>firn</b> <b>limit</b> and decreases progressively below that limit to the terminus, more or less in direct relation to the amount of ice available for transport. Annual fluctuations of velocity in a valley glacier probably reflect the influence of pressure near the head of a glacier and of meltwater near the terminus. Some reported diurnal variations in flow velocity may be partly the product of instrumental wandering or refraction of the line of sight. Changes in temperature, radiation, and meltwater may be the cause of bonafide diurnal velocity variations, but only a thin surficial crust can be involved if this is so. Changes of atmospheric pressure are worthy of consideration, although they do not appear quantitatively competent to account for the larger diurnal velocity variations. Serious doubts are thrown on Demorest's concept of extrusion flow by theoretical analyses and field tests. It is in such a shaky position that satisfactory alternatives should be sought. The most promising to date is Nye's extending and compressive flow which accounts for many of the relations heretofore attributed to extrusion flow. Since Nye's concept is based on theoretical analyses necessarily involving major simplifications and assumptions concerning the behavior of ice deep within a glacier, it needs further examination, analysis, and test before being unconditionally accepted...|$|E
