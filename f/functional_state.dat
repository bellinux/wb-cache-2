5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially <b>functional</b> <b>state</b> for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their <b>functional</b> <b>state,</b> are readily {{understood}} as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same <b>functional</b> <b>state</b> though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{argues that}} <b>functional</b> <b>states,</b> and states {{defined in terms}} of them, cannot be causally {{relevant}} to the output or state transitions in terms of which those <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> are defined, or to intervening mechanisms or to anything to which their output is in turn causally relevant. <b>Functional</b> <b>states</b> therefore cannot be correctly invoked in what I call "simple causal explanations". Explanations which cite <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> are instead a species of explanation by appeal to dispositional properties. Functionalists about the mental are therefore committed either to denying that ordinary explanations of behavior by appeal to mental states are simple causal explanations or to denying that they are true. Special difficulties for functionalism arise in the case of conscious mental states. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{assessment}} of <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> of sportsmen’s, having symptoms of chronic tiredness, organism {{with the help}} of structural-linguistic approach. Material: Sportsmen of different kinds of sports participated in the research. For determination of degree of chronic tiredness questionnaire by Leonova was applied. For classification of <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> of sportsmen’s organism structural-linguistic approach was applied. Results: in 41 % of the questioned sportsmen chronic tiredness was found. Appearance of their not stable states can be caused by reduction of organism’s resistance to loads and high risk of chronic tiredness syndrome. Conclusions: in sportsmen with chronic tiredness we observed functional tension of organism’s regulatory systems in rest and over-tension - after loads.

25|$|A {{challenging}} and special case of study regarding dynamics and flexibility of peptides and full-length proteins {{is represented by}} disordered structures. Nowadays, it is an accepted concept that proteins can exhibit a more flexible behaviour known as disorder or lack of structure; however, {{it is possible to}} describe an ensemble of structures instead of a static picture representing a fully <b>functional</b> <b>state</b> of the protein. Many advances are represented in this field in particular in terms of new pulse sequences, technological improvement, and rigorous training of researchers in the field.|$|E
25|$|Psycho-physiological {{measures}} {{also serve}} as process indices of operator SA by providing {{an assessment of the}} relationship between human performance and a corrected change in the operator's physiology (e.g., French, Clark, Pomeroy, Seymour, & Clarke, 2007). In other words, cognitive activity is associated with changes in the operator's physiological states. For example, the operator's overall <b>functional</b> <b>state</b> (as assessed using psycho-physiological measures, such as electroencephalographic (EEG) data, eyeblinks, and cardiac activity) may provide an indication as to whether the operator is sleep fatigued {{at one end of the}} continuum, or mentally overloaded at the other end (Wilson, 2000). Other psycho-physiological measures, such as event related potentials (ERP), event related desynchronization (ERD), transient heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA), may be useful for evaluating an operator's perception of critical environmental cues, that is, to determine if the operator has detected and perceived a task-relevant stimulus (Wilson, 2000). In addition, it is also possible to use psycho-physiological measures to monitor operators' environmental expectancies, that is, their physiological responses to upcoming events, as a measure of their current level of SA (Wilson, 2000).|$|E

40|$|In {{this debate}} with Lisa Feldman Barrett, I defend {{a view of}} {{emotions}} as biological <b>functional</b> <b>states.</b> Affective neuroscience studies emotions in this sense, but it also studies the conscious experience of emotion (‘feelings’), our ability to attribute emotions to others and to animals (‘attribution’, ‘anthropomorphizing’), our ability to think and talk about emotion (‘concepts of emotion’, ‘semantic knowledge of emotion’) and the behaviors caused by an emotion (‘expression of emotions’, ‘emotional reactions’). I think that the most pressing challenge facing affective neuroscience {{is the need to}} carefully distinguish between these distinct aspects of ‘emotion’. I view emotion <b>states</b> as evolved <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> that regulate complex behavior, in both people and animals, in response to challenges that instantiate recurrent environmental themes. These <b>functional</b> <b>states,</b> in turn, can also cause conscious experiences (feelings), and their effects and our memories for those effects also contribute to our semantic knowledge of emotions (concepts). Cross-species studies, dissociations in neurological and psychiatric patients, and more ecologically valid neuroimaging designs should be used to partly separate these different phenomena...|$|R

2500|$|Ligand binding to a {{receptor}} protein {{alters the}} chemical conformation by affecting the three-dimensional shape orientation. The conformation of a receptor protein composes the <b>functional</b> <b>state.</b> Ligands include substrates, inhibitors, activators, and neurotransmitters. The rate of binding is called affinity, and this measurement typifies a tendency or {{strength of the}} effect. Binding affinity is actualized not only by host-guest interactions, but also by solvent effects that can play a dominant, steric role which drives non-covalent binding in solution. [...] The solvent provides a chemical environment for the ligand and receptor to adapt, and thus accept or reject each other as partners.|$|E

30|$|Here, it {{is worth}} {{discussing}} which <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> of platelets {{are expected to be}} maintained during storage for subsequent preparation of platelet concentrates (to be used for regenerative therapy). There {{is no doubt that the}} <b>functional</b> <b>states</b> observed in freshly isolated platelets are the best for preparation of platelet concentrates and for their best clinical performance. Nevertheless, given that platelet concentrates are expected to provide significant amounts of growth factors and fibrin(ogen) at implantation sites, stored platelets are not necessarily expected to function as fully as fresh ones (e.g., in terms of aggregation). Rather, stored platelets are expected not to lose growth factors during the storage period, while coagulation factors, especially those involved in the endogenous coagulation cascade, should maintain their activities to convert and polymerize fibrinogen to form well cross-linked fibrin fibers.|$|R
