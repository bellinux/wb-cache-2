40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to measure the average fetal dose arising from {{computed}} tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in early pregnancy, and to determine the level of fetal dose reduction afforded {{by the use of}} <b>external</b> <b>lead</b> shielding.

Moreover, due to these discrete states, Coulomb blockade affects the charging of the dot even though its strongly coupled to a lead. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

We analyze under which conditions the effects of the two baths can enter additively the quantum master equation. When such additivity is legitimate, the reduced master equation corresponds to the evolution generated by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and a Haken-Strobl dephasing super-operator.

We numerically calculate the tunneling rate from a laterally confined, few-channel <b>external</b> <b>lead</b> into the lowest orbital state of a spin-orbit coupled quantum dot. We find two mechanisms leading to a spin-dependent tunneling rate. The first originates from different electronic g-factors in the lead and in the dot, and favors the tunneling into the spin ground (excited) state when the g-factor magnitude is larger (smaller) in the lead. The second is triggered by spin-orbit interactions via the opening of off-diagonal spin-tunneling channels. It systematically favors the spin excited state. For physical parameters corresponding to lateral GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and the experimentally reported tunneling rates, both mechanisms lead to a discrepancy of ∼ 10...|$|E

We first transform the problem using Lagrange multipliers into an unconstrained version. Since a stable solution in a Lagrangian formulation only guarantees a local optimum satisfying the constraints, we propose a global search phase in which an aperiodic and bounded trace function is added to the search to first identify promising regions for local search. The trace generates an information-bearing trajectory from which good starting points are identified for further local searches. Taking only a sm [...] ...|$|E

The disadvantage of this conversion {{is that when the}} search is inside a feasible region, some satisfied constraints may still pose a non-zero weight in the Lagrangian function, leading to possible oscillations and divergence when a local optimum lies on the boundary of a feasible region.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} new methods for solving {{nonlinear}} optimization problems. These problems are di cult to solve because the nonlinear constraints form feasible regions that are di cult to nd, and the nonlinear objectives contain local minima that trap descent-type search methods. In order to nd good solutions in nonlinear optimization, {{we focus on}} the following two key issues: how to handle nonlinear constraints and how to escape from local minima. We use a Lagrange-multiplier-based formulation to handle nonlinear constraints, and develop Lagrangian methods with dynamic control to provide faster and more robust convergence. We extend the traditional Lagrangian theory for the continuous space to the To my wife Lei, my parents, and my son Charles discrete space and develop e cient discrete Lagrangian methods. To overcome local minima, we design a new trace-based global-search method that relies on an external traveling trace to pull a search trajectory out of a local optimum in a continuous fashion without having to restart the search from a new starting point. Good starting points identi ed in the global search are used in the local search to identify true local optima.

If a supplier (an external firm or an internal department or plant) cannot supply the required goods on demand, then the client firm must keep an inventory of the needed goods.

In general, the time of order receiving, order handling, order processing, manufacturing, assembly, distribution and delivery time to the customer includes in a lead time. Since the customer perspective is very important. LT has been counted until products or goods arrive to the customer. Hence the lead time measurement can be done from the customer points of view. The customers can be varies by different meanings. For instance, suppliers deliver components or parts to the main manufacturer where manufacturer is the customer from supplier’s perspective. LT can be also measured from the manufacturer points of view. Manufacturer also measures the lead from starting of the processing, fabrication and assembly up-to ready the product for shipment.
