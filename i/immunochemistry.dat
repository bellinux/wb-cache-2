25|$|The <b>immunochemistry</b> of Triticeae glutens is {{important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to gluten proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} {{led to the}} central nervous system. It was taken by Marthe Vogt, a refugee from Germany who at that time worked with John Henry Gaddum in the Institute of Pharmacology of the University of Edinburgh. ″The {{presence}} of noradrenaline and adrenaline in the brain has been demonstrated by von Euler (1946) and Holtz (1950). These substances were supposed, undoubtedly correctly, {{to occur in the}} cerebral vasomotor <= vasoconstrictor> nerves. The present work is concerned with the question whether these sympathomimetic amines, besides their role as transmitters at vasomotor endings, play a part in the function of the central nervous tissue itself. In this paper, these amines will be referred to as sympathin, since they were found invariably to occur together, with noradrenaline representing the major component, as is characteristic for the transmitter of the peripheral sympathetic system.″ Vogt created a detailed map of noradrenaline in the dog brain. Its uneven distribution, not reflecting the distribution of vasomotor nerves, and its persistence after removal of the superior cervical ganglia made it ″tempting to assign to the cerebral sympathin a transmitter role like that which we assign to the sympathin found in the sympathetic ganglia and their postganglionic fibres.″ Her assignment was confirmed, the finishing touch being the visualization of the noradrenaline as well as adrenaline and (see below) dopamine pathways in the central nervous system with the formaldehyde fluorescence method developed by Nils-Åke Hillarp (1916–1965) and Bengt Falck (born 1927) in Sweden and by <b>immunochemistry</b> techniques.|$|E
500|$|Between 1944 and 1954, {{the paper}} was cited at least 239 times (with {{citations}} spread evenly through those years), mostly in papers on microbiology, <b>immunochemistry,</b> and biochemistry. [...] In addition to the follow-up work by McCarty {{and others at the}} Rockefeller Institute in response to Mirsky's criticisms, the experiment spurred considerable work in microbiology, where it shed new light on the analogies between bacterial heredity and the genetics of sexually-reproducing organisms. [...] French microbiologist André Boivin claimed to extend Avery's bacterial transformation findings to Escherichia coli, although this could not be confirmed by other researchers. [...] In 1946, however, Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum demonstrated bacterial conjugation in E. coli and showed that genetics could apply to bacteria, even if Avery's specific method of transformation was not general. [...] Avery's work also motivated Maurice Wilkins to continue X-ray crystallographic studies of DNA, even as he faced pressure from funders to focus his research on whole cells, rather than biomolecules.|$|E
2500|$|New {{immunogenic}} motifs {{appear in}} the literature almost monthly and new gliadin and Triticeae protein sequences appear that contain these motifs. The HLA DQ2.5 restricted peptide [...] "I I Q P Q Q P A Q" [...] produced approximately 50 hits of identical sequences in NCBI-Blast search {{is one of a}} several dozen known motifs whereas {{only a small fraction of}} Triticeae gluten variants have been examined. For this reason the <b>immunochemistry</b> is best discussed at the level of Triticeae, because it is clear that the special immunological properties of the proteins appear to have basal affinities to this taxa, appearing concentrated in wheat as a result of its three various genomes. Some current studies claim that removing the toxicity of gliadins from wheat as plausible, but, as the above illustrates, the problem is monumental. There are many gluten proteins, three genomes with many genes each for alpha, gamma, and omega gliadins. For each motif many genome-loci are present, and there are many motifs, some still not known.|$|E
2500|$|... the {{relative}} rarity of coral snake bites {{combined with the}} high costs of producing and maintaining an antivenom supply mean that antivenom (also called [...] "antivenin") production in the United States has ceased. According to Pfizer, the owner of the company that used to make the antivenom Coralmyn, it would take between $5–$10 million for researching a new synthetic antivenom. The cost was too large for the small number of cases presented each year. The existing American coral snake antivenom stock technically expired in 2008, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has extended the expiration date every year through at least April 30, 2017. [...] Foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers have produced other coral snake antivenoms, but the costs of licensing them in the United States have stalled availability (see above).
