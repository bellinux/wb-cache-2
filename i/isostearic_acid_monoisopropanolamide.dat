40|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} animal fats are {{important}} and established raw materials {{for the production of}} chemicals and ingredients. From its origins more than 150 years ago, the oleochemical industry has grown in scale and diversity to become an important branch of the chemical industry. With increasing emphasis on renewable and sustainable industrial practices, oleochemistry has gained a new momentum as a means to develop alternatives to fossil-derived products. This chapter reviews the role of catalysis and catalyst development in the production of <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> as an example of recent research in oleochemistry. Starting with a brief history of the oleochemical industry, we trace the development of <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> and other branched fatty acids. The special properties of <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> are illustrated through its use in applications inaccessible to standard fatty acids. Finally, we present the latest developments in zeolite catalysis; the step change in yields and selectivities achieved by these new routes illustrates the potential that proper catalyst design can bring to open up significant new markets and applications for oleochemicals...|$|R
50|$|Lactylates {{are also}} {{widely used in}} non-food {{applications}} such as cosmetics or personal care products. In these applications, lactylates function as emulsifiers, conditioners, foam boosters, or plasticizers. These lactylates are typically manufactured from behenic <b>acid,</b> <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> or medium-chain fatty acids such as capric acid, lauric acid, and myristic acid. The lactylates may also be partially neutralized. For these applications, calcium salts are not typically used, since the resulting lactylates {{will not be as}} readily water dispersible as the sodium analog.|$|R
40|$|The phase equilibria were {{analyzed}} {{in a typical}} skin lotion system of water, decane, triethanolamine, and <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the evaporation rate was determined. The system showed two isotropic solutions, one of decane/isostearic a id, and a water/triethanolamine combination. In addition, a large region of lamellar liquid crystal phase was found plus a small region of liquid crystal that consisted of close-packed cylinders. Evaporation of water and decane initially led to a transfer of triethanolamine from the aqueous olution to the decane/isostearic a id solution. With sufficient depletion of water and decane, a three-phase region was entered with the third phase, the lameIlar liquid crystal...|$|R
40|$|Extraction is a downstream-process {{option in}} {{bio-based}} processes. Since {{the knowledge of}} phase-separation behavior is essential for designing efficient separation processes, this study investigates the settling and coalescence behavior of bio-based extraction systems using a standard lab-scale settling cell. The influence of different buffer media {{as well as of}} E. coli cells on coalescence was determined for the reactive extraction of hexane- 1. 6 -diamine with <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> and D 2 EHPA using kerosene and oleyl alcohol as diluents. As a result, an increasing pH value of the buffer significantly increases settling time. The presence of E. coli cells hinders the phase separation of the investigated systems, in particular with dispersed organic phases. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Aldara is a cream {{used for}} topical {{treatment}} of non-melanoma skin cancer, and {{is thought to}} act through stimulation of anti-tumour immunity. The active ingredient, imiquimod, {{has been shown to}} stimulate toll-like receptor 7. Aldara also induces psoriasis-like lesions when applied to naive murine skin, and as such is used as a mouse model for psoriasis. Here we find that in naive murine skin, Aldara induces inflammation largely independently of toll-like receptor 7. Surprisingly, inflammasome activation, keratinocyte death and interleukin 1 release also occur in response to the vehicle cream in the absence of imiquimod. We show that <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> a major component of the vehicle, promotes inflammasome activation in cultured keratinocytes, and so may contribute to the observed effects of Aldara on murine skin. Aldara therefore stimulates at least two immune pathways independently, and both imiquimod and vehicle are required for a full inflammatory response. Although it remains to be tested, it is possible that imiquimod-independent effects also contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of Aldara...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{production}} of polymers constitutes the major mass {{flow in the}} chemical industry. The foreseeable future change from fossil to renewable resources leads to the demand for more production routes based on biotechnological conversions. These routes preferably require biocompatible components and possess certain limitations of temperature and pH value for the corresponding downstream processing, which can be met by liquid–liquid extraction. This study investigates the extraction of the monomers hexane- 1, 6 -diamine and butane- 1, 4 -diamine from fermentation media using bis(2 -ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate and <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> as reactive extractants and kerosene as well as oleyl alcohol as diluents. RESULTS: As expected, the degree of extraction strongly depends on the pH-value but only weakly on the diluents. A higher diluent polarity leads to a slightly higher degree of extraction at a given pH value. The fraction of reactive extractant {{can be used to}} adjust theminimal pH value to reach the desired degree of extraction. No significant influence of fermentationmedium, buffer, presence of an E. coli microorganism, or temperature was detected. CONCLUSION: Reactive extraction of bio-based diamines with organic acids is feasible. The degree of extraction can be adjusted by the fraction of reactive extractant. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{polyethyleneimine}} (PEI) –fatty acid complexes using oleic <b>acid</b> (OA), <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> (ISA), and stearic acid (SA) were prepared through a simple process. While PEI was not soluble in toluene, the complex with OA and ISA became soluble when its additive content {{was greater than}} 5  mol% based on the ethyleneimine (EI) unit of PEI. PEI–SA had similar solubility in toluene when more than 5  mol% of SA was added; however, the complex precipitated when the additive ratio of SA was increased to 40  mol%. The effect of fatty acid of PEI complexes on their TiO 2 nanoparticle adsorption properties and the flow curves of TiO 2 nanoparticle/toluene suspension was then studied using PEI complexed with 30  mol% of fatty acids. Surprisingly, while PEI–OA and PEI–ISA complexes effectively adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles until saturation, the amount of adsorbed PEI–SA increased continuously. Comparing the flow curves of TiO 2 /toluene suspensions under 1. 4  mg/m 2 addition of PEI–fatty acid complexes, where PEI–OA and PEI–ISA were under saturated adsorption, {{it was confirmed that}} PEI–OA effectively stabilizes TiO 2 nanoparticles in toluene without imparting thixotropic properties up to 30  vol%, while the suspensions with PEI–SA and PEI–ISA were solidified at lower volume contents and had high thixotropic properties...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} antimutagens in yogurt active against the experimental colon carcinogen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Our initial experiments showed that acetone extracts of yogurt, or milk fermented by various lactic acid bacteria were antimutagenic against MNNG and 3, 2 '-dimethyl- 4 -aminobiphenyl (DMAB) in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100). Further experiments carried out with milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191 R showed that the putative compounds were more soluble in DMSO than in water, and that extractability of activity against MNNG and DMAB varied with pH, suggesting the presence of ionizable groups. Subsequent experiments demonstrated the antimutagenicity of yogurt. An acetone extract of yogurt was found to be active against a range of mutagens and promutagens in the Ames test. Simulation of fermentation by addition of lactic acid, lactic acid bacteria, or both to milk did not increase antimutagenicity, suggesting that compounds responsible for the activity may be formed during fermentation. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a known dairy anticarcinogen, did not inhibit MNNG or DMAB indicating that other antimutagens may be present in yogurt. Fractionation of the acetone extract by HPLC showed that anti- MNNG and anti-DMAB activities did not co-elute, indicating that different compounds were responsible for the two activities. Using the Ames test to direct purification, isolation of an anti-MNNG active compound was accomplished using silica gel, Sephadex LH- 20 and C 18 reversed phase medium pressure chromatographies. The antimutagen was identified as palmitic acid by: a) co-elution with authentic palmitic acid on GC and HPLC columns, and b) by comparison of mass and ¹³C-NMR spectra. Minor components of milk fat such as iso methyl branched fatty acids (isopalmitic acid, isomargaric acid, isomyrsitic <b>acid,</b> and <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid)</b> were found to be more active than their straight chain counterparts. Isopalmitic acid also inhibited 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4 NQO) and the P 450 -mediated activation of 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The mechanism of antimutagenesis against MNNG has not been established...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} are to design, synthesize, and evaluate hydrocarbon-based or oxygenated hydrocarbon-based CO 2 soluble surfactants. These surfactants {{would be able to}} form stable water-in-CO 2 microemulsions with polar microenvironments capable of dissolving polar species in the bulk non-polar CO 2 solvent, or to form metal precursors which can be reduced to nanoparticles in the presence of stabilizing ligands, or to generate foams in-situ for enhanced oil recovery application. Several oxygenated hydrocarbons, including acetylated sugars, poly(propylene glycol), oligo(vinyl acetate), and highly branched methylated hydrocarbons were used generate CO 2 -soluble ionic surfactants. Surfactants with vinyl acetate tails yielded the most promising results, exhibiting levels of CO 2 solubility comparable to those associated with fluorinated ionic surfactants. For example, a sodium sulfate with single, oligomeric vinyl acetate (VAc) tails consisting of 10 VAc repeat units was 7 wt% soluble in CO 2 at 25 oC and 48 MPa. Upon introduction of water to these systems, only surfactants with the oligomeric vinyl acetate tails exhibited spectroscopic evidence of a polar environment that was capable of solubilizing the methyl orange into CO 2 -rich phase. Silver bis(3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 1 -hexyl) sulfosuccinate, Ag-AOT-TMH, was synthesized from hydrocarbon-based ionic surfactant of sodium bis(3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 1 -hexyl) sulfosuccinate, Na-AOT-TMH through ion exchange. Ag-AOT-TMH exhibits 1. 2 wt% solubility in dense CO 2 at 40 oC and 52 MPa. Silver nanoparticles were produced by reducing the supercritical CO 2 solution containing 0. 06 wt% Ag-AOT-TMH and 0. 5 wt% perfluorooctanethiol (stabilizing ligand) using a reducing agent of NaBH 4. Iso-stearic acid, a short, stubby compound with branched, methylated tails, as a hydrocarbon-based nonionic surfactant, has been shown to have high solubility in carbon dioxide. The solvation of the tails by carbon dioxide has made <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> sterically stabilize metallic nanoparticles as a ligand. The stability of CO 2 -water emulsion formed by ionic and nonionic surfactants was studied in CO 2 at 22 oC and 34. 5 MPa for 0. 01 - 1. 0 wt% surfactant mixed with equivalent volumes of CO 2 and water. Emulsion stability was monitored by observing the rate of collapse of the white, opaque middle-phase emulsion between the transparent CO 2 and water phases and the steady-state volume of the emulsion. It was found that at surfactant concentration of 0. 01 wt%, oligo(vinyl acetate) 10 sodium sulfate displayed the best emulsion, taking over 450 minutes to collapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains many}} references {{on the wide}} range of useful emulsifying agents for OIL-IN-WATER EMULSIONS. On the contrary, little has appeared in the area of new emulsifiers for stabilizing WATER-IN-OIL SYSTEMS. It is generally known that it is far more difficult to prepare stable w/o emulsions than those of the o/w type. Polyglycerol esters having lipophilic surface activity derived chiefly from <b>isostearic</b> and oleic <b>acids</b> were pre-pared and characterized. A chemical description of these surfactants and other isostearic surfactants will be reviewed. Their physical and chemical properties are assessed as water-in-oil emulsifiers. Emulsifier efficiency is compared in the stabilization of simple w/o emulsions. Stability testing techniques are discussed. Applications of these unique emulsifiers in preparing stable aesthetic functional w/o cosmetic emulsions are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. study {{investigates the}} {{adsorption}} of monomeric (<b>isostearic</b> <b>acid,</b> ISA) and oligomeric fatty acids (poly(hydroxystearic acid), PHS 1400 and PHS 3500) to nanoparticles of industrial interest in carriers with different solvent properties. It {{was found that}} it was necessary to apply a number of methods to study the adsorption and subsequent stabilisation of the particles by the dispersing molecules, namely adsorption isotherm methods, rheological techniques, atomic force microscopy and UV/vis spectroscopy. The particles (surface) studied consist of uncoated titania and a commercially available titania coated with a combination of alumina and silica. The use of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to study the adsorption behaviour of polydisperse dispersants provided information not only about the amount of the dispersant adsorbed to the surface, but also the preferential adsorption of low molecular weight components. The displacement of large molecules by smaller ones could be monitored in order to gain insight into the types of adsorption mechanisms at work. It was found that small molecules were unable to fully displace their larger counterparts, suggesting that there was more than one adsorption mechanism in effect. This was supported by the adsorption study of one of the fatty acid dispersants which was esterified with methanol to remove the acid functionality. Adsorption at the particle surface still occurred, but at a much reduced rate. The preferential adsorption of the smaller molecules was also found to be largely eliminated. Adsorption isotherms showed Langmuir-like adsorption behaviour of the molecules to the surface, probably through a combination of acid-base interaction and other specific interactions between surfactant molecule and surface. Adsorption of the dispersant molecules at the particle surface was found to vary with solvent properties reflecting the equilibrium which is established between solubility of the dispersant in solution (χ) and that adsorbed on the surface (г) as a result of adsorption affinity (χs). Steric layer thickness δ could be varied by altering dispersion medium (and hence solvency of the stabilising chain) and by altering molecular weight of the surfactant. This had a significant effect upon the bulk properties of the suspended particles measured by rheological methods. For optimised dispersion performance with high solids load at low viscosity whilst maintaining descrete dispersed particles, as determined by assessing the optical properties of the suspension, the stabilising layer required is dependent upon the particle type and size: small particles require small steric layers. It was found that some degree of polydispersity was important for the oligomeric fatty acid dispersants. Although good adsorption characteristics were observed for the monodisperse monomeric dispersant, adsorption appeared to be optimum for the 1400 Mw oligomeric which had a high proportion of low molecular weight components as well as larger molecules present. Removal of the low molecular weight components from PHS 3500 resulted in interactions measured by AFM that appeared to indicate bridging behaviour due to reduced packing efficiency.

40|$|The light alkyl {{branching}} in <b>isostearic</b> <b>acid</b> (ISAC) imparts it {{with unique}} physical properties and functionalities among fatty acids, {{making it a}} valuable raw material {{in the production of}} lubricants, cosmetics and surface-active agents. Being derived from renewable vegetable oils, ISAC has the potential to become a key oleochemical building block in the growing bio-based industrial sector. However, it can currently be manufactured only as a co-product in the polymerisation of unsaturated acids, utilising swelling clays as catalyst. This leads to product balance issues, and a costly purification process. A more selective route to alkyl isomerisation (branching) of unsaturated fatty acids would lower production costs and open up new markets and applications. The prospect of a direct route has recently moved closer, when ferrierite, a medium-pore zeolite, was found to be an effective catalyst in its acid form (H-FER) for the isomerisation of oleic acid (OA), resulting in a step change in the yield of branched unsaturated fatty acids. The goal {{of this study is to}} understand the relationship between ferrierite structure and performance, in order to further improve the selectivity, activity and robustness of the zeolite, and thus enable optimisation of the catalytic process for the industrial production of ISAC. To better understand catalyst deactivation, the formation and nature of “coke” species have been studied during the H-FER-catalysed isomerisation of OA. UV-Vis and FT-IR spectroscopic analyses of the spent catalyst materials, complemented by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses of the carbonaceous deposits extract, provide new insights into the deactivation mechanisms. The initial, high catalyst activity is quickly lost, despite conservation of the framework integrity. Dodecyl benzene is the major “coke” constituent, while polyenylic carbocations poison the active sites. Pore blockage is detected very early in the reaction, and only the pore mouth is actively employed. Large zeolite crystals were studied to get more detailed spatial insight into deactivation of ferrierite in the OA alkyl isomerisation, using a combination of visible micro-spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. The limited activity observed is in line with the pore mouth catalysis hypothesis; the visible micro-spectroscopy data furthermore shows that the accumulation of aromatic species associated with deactivation (and therefore the reaction) is limited to the crystal edges. Fluorescence microscopy data strongly suggest the presence of polyenylic carbocations, and light polarisation reveals that these carbonaceous species are aligned only in the larger 10 -membered ring (10 -MR) channels of ferrierite at all crystal edges; the reaction is thus further limited to these specific pore mouths. Finally, a study of the relationship between bulk acidity and performance is reported for five commercial ferrierite catalysts; significant differences were found, independently of their bulk Si/Al ratios. Initial pore conversion correlates with Brønsted acidity in the 10 -MR channels, as determined by pyridine adsorption/desorption and FT-IR. A low density of external acid sites reduces OA oligomerisation, while a high ratio of Brønsted to Lewis sites explains the high branching yield. FT-IR combined with CO adsorption and temperature-programmed NH 3 desorption, confirm that having a few, strong Brønsted acid sites increases selectivity to mono-branching...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of {{free fatty acids}} into myxoviruses was shown, using branched-chain fatty acids as molecular markers. The presence of <b>isostearic</b> or phytanic <b>acid</b> was detected by gas-liquid chromatography in the phospholipid fraction of the A 0 /PR 8 / 34 strain of influenza virus. Uptake of free fatty acids into the virus varied from 8 to 11 per cent and {{was accompanied by a}} shift in the fatty acid profile. Infected allantoic fluids from eggs treated with branched-chain acids possessed higher hemagglutinin activity when compared to fluids infected under normal conditions. Attempts to detect branched-chain acids in Sendai virus were unsuccessful. Shifts in acyl chain composition persisted after three passages of modified viruses in the absence of branched-chain acids. Force-area curves at an air-water interface revealed the cross-sectional area of branched-chain acids to be greater than their straight-chain homologs. It is suggested that hydrophobic interactions can alter the configuration of envelope proteins. Such changes may have {{an important role in the}} selection of fragments of influenza viral genome and can conceivably alter viral genotype...|$|R
