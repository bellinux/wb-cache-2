Therefore, the main goal of this research project consists in making a detailed <b>geoscientific</b> <b>information</b> system (GSIS) of the Sherbrooke region, covering an area of 150 km 2 approximately. The GSID is elaborated essentially from well and borehole data, geotechnical reports, cartographic data and field observations. The elaboration of the GSIS is first done by setting up a GSID on Excel, using point data from the region. This GSID is then verified and corrected before being integrated finally in the ArcView GIS. In the case of boreholes not reaching the bedrock, further corrections to the thickness of the overburden are effected with the help of data from nearby boreholes and a series of successive interpolations. With ArcView software, interpolation maps can be drawn up. Several types of maps are derived from the GSID: bedrock topography, depth of the upper limit of the water table, total thickness to the overburden, and thickness and topography of different unconsolidated formations. The interpolation method used is Kriging when possible. The computation is based on a theoretical model chosen by the analysis of semi-variogrammes. By integrating the GSID to a GIS, the various municipal authorities can use the GSIS to keep an inventory of the stratigraphy of Sherbrooke's territory and define, among other things, risk zones in accordance with constraints of town planning and building of infrastructures...|$|R

Geoscientists at BGS have learnt that {{it is essential to}} understand their clients‘ individual needs in order to provide appropriately customised data outputs. It is only in this way that geoscientists can ensure their data will be used fully and effectively within the planning process, and adequately support urban development [...] Therefore, new and innovative ways of communicating and visualising <b>geoscientific</b> <b>information</b> are being exploited. Advances in the use of Geographical Information Systems and 3 D modelling software are enabling geo-environmental information systems, which take full account of the third dimension, to be constructed for several of the UK’s main urban areas, The <b>geoscientific</b> <b>information</b> are provided within regional and detailed 3 D geological models, which are attributed with physical, chemical or hydrogeological property data. These models can be used to predict not only the rock and soil type but also variations in properties within any particular unit or formation. The 3 D geological models can therefore help to provide solutions to many geoenvironmental issues raised during the planning process. By using the 3 D geological model in this manner, it will be demonstrated that geoscientists are now moving from conceptual ground models towards more realistic ground models based on actual ground investigation data. There are three main issues which still need to be resolved if large-scale up-take of 3 D models in urban planning is to be achieved. Firstly, all users of digital geoscience data must understand the limitations of the data on which their assessments are based. This is becoming critical as improvements in 3 D modelling techniques are allowing geoscientists to introduce a far greater level of realism to their models. The second issue is the ability to represent easily the variability within geological units. The attributed models presented in this paper largely display the bulk attributes for a particular unit. The level of resolution is limited by the amount of data available on which to model a particular geological formation or member [...] Finally, there must be an efficient dissemination of data, which depends largely on the continued development of the Internet as a medium for data transfer.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{a research}} project {{that has led to}} the design and prototype implementation of several data storage schemes suited to the efficient multi-scale representation of integrated spatial data. Spatial information systems will benefit from having data models which allow for data to be viewed and analysed at various levels of detail, while the integration of data from different sources will lead to a more accurate representation of reality. The work has addressed two specific problems. The first concerns the design of an integrated multi-scale data model suited for use within Geographical Information Systems. This has {{led to the development of}} two data models, each of which allow for the integration of terrain data and topographic data at multiple levels of detail. The models are based on a combination of adapted versions of three previous data structures, namely, the constrained Delaunay pyramid, the line generalisation tree and the fixed grid. The second specific problem addressed in this thesis has been the development of an integrated multi-scale 3 -D geological data model, for use within a <b>Geoscientific</b> <b>Information</b> System. This has resulted in a data storage scheme which enables the integration of terrain data, geological outcrop data and borehole data at various levels of detail. The thesis also presents details of prototype database implementations of each of the new data storage schemes. These implementations have served to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of an integrated multi-scale approach. The research has also brought to light some areas that will need further research before fully functional systems are produced. The final chapter contains, in addition to conclusions made as a result of the research to date, a summary of some of these areas that require future work...|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} and geotechnical {{characterization of}} shallow formations {{is one of}} the main steps in performing a microzonation study. This paper presents an example of the usefulness of the information compiled in a geological and geotechnical database for the estimation of the seismic response of the shallower formations of the Lisbon downtown area of Baixa. The geotechnical characterization of this area was performed based on the analysis of Standard Penetration Test (SPT) data compiled in the geological and geotechnical database. This database, connected to a <b>geoscientific</b> <b>information</b> system (CGIS), allows, also, the definition of 2 D geological profiles used for estimating the thickness of the shallower layers. The shear-wave velocities (V S) for each layer were estimated from empirical correlations using mean SPT values computed from the statistical evaluation of the compiled data. These V S values were further calibrated with ambient vibration recording analysis. The seismic response of Baixa’s superficial deposits was estimated by applying a 1 D equivalent linear method to a set of soil profiles, regularly distributed across the area, and using synthetic accelerograms to simulate input motions associated with probable earthquake occurrences in Lisbon. The results are presented in terms of maps of predominant frequencies, with the corresponding amplification level, as well as spectral amplification factors for 1 Hz and 2. 5 Hz. The results show that the fundamental frequency of the Baixa area is between 1. 2 Hz and 2 Hz, for the whole central valley, reaching 3 Hz near the edges where anthroprogenic and alluvial deposits have less expression. Amplification factors up to 5 were obtained. These results were achieved regardless of the considered input motion. The similarity of the obtained fundamental frequency with the natural frequency of Baixa’s old building stock increases the probability of resonance effects in future earthquakes. </p...|$|R
