In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham <b>Jail</b> <b>on</b> its front page. The Tribune became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign.

After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall.

5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought {{to rein in the}} assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in <b>jail</b> <b>on</b> Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{available}} research <b>on</b> <b>jails</b> focuses <b>on</b> large institutions, located in urban areas. In this study we empirically consider whether this emphasis shortchanges our understanding of jails by comparing 2, 638 rural and urban <b>jails</b> <b>on</b> four dimensions: <b>jail</b> size and use, inmate characteristics, staff char-acteristics, and inmate services. Our results reveal several important cleavages between rural and urban <b>jails.</b> Based <b>on</b> our findings and a conception of jails as influenced in meaningful ways by their social, political, and organizational contexts, we suggest avenues for future research on local incarceration...|$|R
