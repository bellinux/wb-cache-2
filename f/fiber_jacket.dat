40|$|To {{improve the}} {{treatments}} for low back pain, new designs of total disk replacement have been proposed. The {{question is how}} well these designs {{can act as a}} functional replacement of the intervertebral disk. Four finite element models were made, for four different design concepts, to determine how well they can mimic the physiological intervertebral disk mechanical function. The four designs were a homogenous elastomer, a multi-stiffness elastomer, an elastomer with <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket,</b> and a hydrogel with <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket.</b> The best material properties of the four models were determined by optimizing the model behavior to match the behavior of the intervertebral disk in flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending. It was shown that neither a homogeneous elastomer nor a multi-stiffness elastomer could mimic the non-linear behavior within the physiological range of motion. Including a <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket</b> around an elastomer allowed for physiological motion in all degrees of freedom. Replacing the elastomer by a hydrogel yielded similar good behavior. Mimicking the non-linear behavior of the intervertebral disk, in the physiological range of motion is essential in maintaining and restoring spinal motion and in protecting surrounding tissues like the facet joints or adjacent segments. This was accomplished with designs mimicking the function of the annulus fibrosus...|$|E
40|$|Forward stimulated Brillouin {{scattering}} (FSBS) {{is observed}} in a standard 2 -km-long highly nonlinear fiber. The frequency of FSBS arising from multiple radially guided acoustic resonances is observed up to gigahertz frequencies. The tight confinement of the light and acoustic field enhances the interaction and results in a large gain coefficient of 34. 7 W(- 1) at a frequency of 933. 8 MHz. We also find that the profile on the anti-Stokes side of the pump beam have lineshapes that are asymmetric, which we show {{is due to the}} interference between FSBS and the optical Kerr effect. The measured FSBS resonance linewidths are found to increase linearly with the acoustic frequency. Based on this scaling, we conclude that dominant contribution to the linewidth is from surface damping due to the <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket</b> and structural nonuniformities along the fiber...|$|E

In this paper, we report on our study of jacket effect to distributed Brillouin sensor system on strain measurement accuracy for constant load stretching and constant length stretching using the 900 m m tight-buffered fiber (Type-A) and the 250 m m optical fiber (Type-B). We have studied the time-varying performance under the stretching of constant load and length. It was found that, within 48 hours under constant load stretching, the strain value of the Type-A measured by BOTDR (Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometer) increased with time, while the Type-B it kept stable. Within 48 hours under constant length stretching, the strain value of the Type-A decreased with time, while the Type-B it kept stable. After relaxation, the strain value of the Type-B reached zero within 1 hour, while the Type-A declined gradually. We found the creep deformation and stress relaxation of jacket to be the leading cause to this phenomena...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two-mode fiber acousto-optic frequency shifters demonstrated to date suffer in that they are not reliable and economically feasible. Class horns are used that are in efficient and not easily reproduceable. Also, the configurations require either a second acousto-optic interacion region, which limits the bandwidth over which good performance can be achieved, or a mode selecting direction coupler. These components add extra length and cost to the device. In this thesis new approaches are taken in developing the frequency shifter that allow for improvements in the areas of reliablity and cost. Horns machined out of aluminum are designed to have a resonance at the frequency of operation so that bigger tip movements can be obtained, allowing for a reduced interaction region. A static mode converter is used, replacing the second interaction region and allowing for a larger electrical bandwidth. Using these approaches, we have demostrated a device that gives 100 % conversion of light at a wavelength of 1. 0 pm using an interaction length of 3 cm without having to remove the <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket,</b> and having an electrical bandwidth of 64 KHz.

40|$|The {{development}} of integrated fiber optic sensors {{for use in}} aerospace health monitoring systems demands that the sensors {{be able to perform}} in extreme environments. In order to use fiber optic sensors effectively in an extreme environment one must have a thorough understanding of the sensor's capabilities, limitations, and performance under extreme environmental conditions. This paper reports on our current sensor evaluation examining the performance of freestanding fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) at extreme temperatures. While the ability of FBGs to survive at extreme temperatures has been established, their performance and long term survivability is not well documented. At extreme temperatures the grating structure would be expected to dissipate, degrading the sensors performance and eventually ceasing to return a detectable signal. The <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket</b> will dissipate leaving a brittle, unprotected fiber. For FBGs to be used in aerospace systems their performance and limitations need to be thoroughly understood at extreme temperatures. As the limits of the FBGs performance are pushed the long term survivability and performance of the sensor comes into question. We will not only examine the ability of FBGs to survive extreme temperatures but also look at their performance during many thermal cycles. This paper reports on test results of the performance of thermal cycling commercially available FBGs, at temperatures up to 1000 C, seen in aerospace applications. Additionally this paper will report on the performance of commercially available FBGs held at 1000 C for hundreds of hours. Throughout the evaluation process, various parameters of the FBGs performance were monitored and recorded. Several test samples were subjected to identical test conditions to allow for statistical analysis of the data.

Regenerative therapies for disc repair are promising treatments, {{but they need to}} be tested in physiological models. PurposeTo develop a physiological inÂ vitro explant model that incorporates the native environment of the intervertebral disc, for example, hypoxia, low glucose, and high tissue osmolarity. Study designBovine nucleus pulposus (NP) explants were cultured for 42 days in conditions mimicking the native physiological environment. Two different approaches were used to balance the swelling pressure of the NP: raised medium osmolarity or an artificial annulus. MethodsBovine NP explants were either cultured in media with osmolarity balanced at isotonic and hypertonic levels compared with the native tissue or cultured inside a <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket</b> used as an artificial annulus. Oxygen and glucose levels were set at either standard (21 % O 2 and 4. 5 g/L glucose) or physiological (5 % O 2 and 1 g/L glucose) levels. Samples were analyzed at Day 0, 3, and 42 for tissue composition (water, sulfated glycosaminoglycans, DNA, and hydroxyproline contents and fixed charge density), tissue histology, cell viability, and cellular behavior with messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. ResultsBoth the hypertonic culture and the artificial annulus approach maintained the tissue matrix composition for 42 days. At Day 3, mRNA expressions of aggrecan, collagen Type I, and collagen Type II in both hypertonic and artificial annulus cultures were not different from Day 0; however, at Day 42, the artificial annulus preserved the mRNA expression closer to Day 0. Gene expressions of matrix metalloprotease 13, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease 1, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease 2 were downregulated under physiological O 2 and glucose levels, whereas the other parameters analyzed were not affected.

50|$|The deck, which curves {{from one}} end to the other, was {{reinforced}} by adding heavily confined edge beams encasing high strength steel along the inside face of the exterior longitudinal girders underneath. These rods extended {{from one end}} of the roadway to the other. The reinforced edge beams ensure continuity across the many expansion joints and help distribute the bending strains due to lateral flexure. In addition to the reinforced edge beam, four large prestressing tendons were installed the length of the bridge along the underside of the deck slab. These tendons are stressed to pre-compress the concrete deck to approximately 800 psi and also serve as flexural reinforcement along with the high strength rods. Finally, engineers found a way to reinforce the bent columns attached to the arch, which possess complex and varying geometric challenges.

40|$|For {{a variety}} of applications, it is {{important}} to measure the sensitivity of the pointing of a beam emerging from a collimator, as a function of temperature changes. A straightforward method for carrying out this measurement is based on using interferometry for monitoring the changes in beam pointing, which presents its own problems. The added temperature dependence and complexity issues relating to using an interferometer are addressed by not using an interferometer in the first place. Instead, the collimator is made part of an arrangement that uses a minimum number of low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and by using a quad diode to measure changes in beam pointing. In order to minimize the influence of the test arrangement on the outcome of the measurement, several steps are taken. The collimator assembly is placed on top of a vertical, 1 -m-long, fused silica tube. The quad diode is bonded to a fused silica bar, which, in turn, is bonded to {{the lower end of the}} fused silica tube. The lower end of the tube rests on a self-aligning support piece, while the upper end of the tube is kept against two rounded setscrew tips, using a soft rubber string. This ensures that very little stress is applied to the tube as the support structure changes dimensions due to thermal expansion. Light is delivered to the collimator through a bare fiber in order to minimize variable bending torque caused by a randomly relaxing, rigid <b>fiber</b> <b>jacket.</b> In order to separate the effect of temperature on the collimator assembly from the effect temperature has on the rest of the setup, multiple measurements are taken with the collimator assembly rotated from measurement to measurement. Laboratory testing, with 1 -m spacing between the collimator and the quad diode, has shown that the sensitivity of the arrangement is better than 100 nm rms, over time spans of at least one hour, if the beam path is protected from atmospheric turbulence by a tube. The equivalent sensitivity to detecting changes in pointing angle is 100 nanoradians...|$|E

40|$|The {{upgrading}} of bridges {{located in}} seismic areas and built according to obsolete codes {{is becoming a}} priority task for highway administrations. Among the possible upgrading strategies, the use of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) jackets is gaining widespread acceptance. In this paper, a design equation is proposed to determine the optimal thickness of FRP jackets, to enhance the ductility of existing reinforced-concrete (RC) bridge piers with circular cross sections. The design procedure stems from the definition of an upgrading index, given as {{the ratio of the}} target to availability ductility at the pier base section, to be attained through FRP jacketing. The available ductility is that identified through the usual assessment procedures on the RC member set for upgrade, whereas the target ductility is evaluated based on the expected actions on the bridge. The upgrading index is initially defined in general terms and is subsequently extended to the case of piers built in seismic regions. It results in a simple expression in terms of easily computable quantities, such as the ultimate strain and the peak strength of concrete, before and after upgrading. A parametric study on old-code-designed bridge pier sections, upgraded with either glass or carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>jackets,</b> is performed based on a fiber-section model equipped with a newly developed FRP-confined concrete model. This study shows that the index, despite its simplicity, yields excellent predictions of the ductility increase obtained through FRP wrapping, and it is therefore used to develop a design equation.

The design procedure has been applied to available experimental tests of a scaled bridge pier wrapped with FRP and tested to failure, and it has been demonstrated to be very effective...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{confinement}} introduced by CFRP (Carbon <b>Fiber</b> Reinforced Polymer) <b>jackets</b> highly increases the ultimate compressive strength and ductility of concrete. Various experimental research programs have been carried out to express the increase in strength and strain by the use of CFRP jackets, but, in the majority of cases, the additional effects of reinforcing elements, like ties or spirals, have not been analyzed very well. This paper provides investigations on wrapped short concrete columns with and without ties and spirals. In an extensive research program the volumetric ratio of the CFRP jacket and the ratio of transverse reinforcement were varied. Thereby, columns with different geometrical shape, different CFRP thickness, and different transverse reinforcement elements were produced. Executed deformation controlled compression tests provided investigations concerning the structural behavior of the test specimens. The main results of these tests will be explained.

Preliminary tests were conducted {{to focus on the}} grout best able to fill a fibrous network since the goal {{of this study was to}} develop an optimized grout able to be injected in a mat of steel fibers for concrete strengthening. The grout composition was developed based on criteria for fresh state and hardened state properties. For a CEMI 42. 5 R based grout different high range water reducer dosages (0 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 7 %) and silica fume (SF) dosages (0 %, 2 %, 4 %) were tested (as replacement of cement by mass). Rheological measurements were used to investigate the effect of polycarboxylates (PCEs) and SF dosage on grout properties, particularly its workability loss, as the mix was to be injected in a matrix of steel <b>fibers</b> for concrete <b>jacketing.</b> The workability behaviour was characterized by the rheological parameters yield stress and plastic viscosity (for different grout temperatures and resting times), as well as the procedures of mini slump cone and funnel flow time. Then, further development focused only on the best grout compositions. The cement substitution by 2 % of SF exhibited the best overall behaviour and was considered as the most promising compared to the others compositions tested. Concerning the fresh state analysis, a significant workability loss was detected if grout temperature increased above 35 degrees C. Below this temperature the grout presented a self-levelling behaviour and a life time equal to 45 min. In the hardened state, silica fumes increased not only the grout's porosity but also the grout's compressive strength at later ages, since the pozzolanic contribution to the compressive strength does not occur until 28 d and beyond.
