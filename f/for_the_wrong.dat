5|$|Several highly {{acclaimed}} {{editions of}} Schubert's last sonatas are available, namely those of Bärenreiter, Henle, Universal, and Oxford University Press. These editions have, however, occasionally received some criticism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> interpretation or notation of Schubert's intentions, {{on issues such}} as deciphering the correct pitches from the manuscript, notating tremoli, discriminating between accent and decrescendo markings, and reconstructing missing bars.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> purpose.|$|E
5|$|Adam and Rachel (James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale), and Karen and David (Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst) {{arrive in}} Sydney, Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) hastily {{arranged}} wedding. Jo's father Rod Ellison (Gary Sweet) is {{surprised to learn}} that his daughter is getting married to a man he suspects is only after his money. After speaking to Rod, Adam tells Pete that he thinks the wedding is going ahead <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons. Pete reacts angrily and tells Adam to forget being his best man. The following morning, Rod tries to bribe Pete to call off the wedding, but Pete declines. He later overhears Rod forbidding Jo to marry him and tells her they ought to postpone the wedding. Jo is devastated at his decision, and tells him to get out of her house. She confides her sorrow in her ex-fiancé Shawn (Sandy Winton), who unsuccessfully tries to restart their relationship by proposing to her.|$|E

5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a paedophile, were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons).|$|E
25|$|Julia is the thirty-six-year-old {{daughter}} of Agnes and Tobias. Three times divorced, {{she has just}} recently left her fourth husband and has returned home. Her father calls her a whiner, and her mother has little time for her. Julia, based on a relative of Albee’s, his cousin Barbara Lauder, has set a pattern in her life of marrying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons and then divorcing and returning home. Her parents welcome her, although they {{make it clear that}} they wish she would establish an independent life of her own.|$|E
25|$|Canterbury’s initial {{season was}} a {{remarkable}} one – <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons. Playing without a home ground, the team suffered a number of massive losses, losing in successive weeks during May 6–91 to St George and 7–87 to Easts – the two heaviest defeats {{in the history of}} the competition. The club managed to avoid the wooden spoon by twice defeating the winless University, but still conceded 140 tries in sixteen matches or an average of 8.75 tries per game, which remains the second-highest figure in NSWRFL/NRL history behind the 9.08 tries per game conceded by University in their debut 1920 season.|$|E

25|$|In 1098 {{there were}} 35 {{dependent}} priories of Molesme, and other annexes and some priories of nuns. Donors {{from the surrounding}} area vied {{with one another in}} helping the monks; soon they had more than they needed, slackened their way of life and became tepid. Benefactors sent their children to the abbey for education and other non-monastic activities began to dominate daily life. The vast land holdings they had acquired required a large number of employees. As the community grew increasingly wealthy, it began to attract men seeking entry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons. They caused a division among the brothers, challenging Robert's severity.

25|$|The {{prosecution}} showed video {{evidence from}} {{a post office}} in the city center, where Elgaas was seen paying for the massive amount of giros.

Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for people {{who did not want to}} be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> person. The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, Trond Giske, and the general secretary, Rita Ottervik, to continue with the 'advancements'.|$|E
25|$|For Shach, battling secularism and Zionism was not enough. During {{the years}} of his leadership, he also waged bitter wars against anybody he {{suspected}} of deviation from the Haredi path. At the behest of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Shach joined the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. When Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin died in 1966, Shach {{became president of the}} Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, until he resigned from the Moetzes after the other leading rabbis refused to follow him. Shach wrote strongly in support of every observant citizen voting. He felt that a vote not cast for the right party or candidate was effectively a vote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> party and candidate. This theme is consistent in his writings from the time that the State of Israel was established.|$|E

In March 2004, Surovikin was accused by Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Chibizov of beating him up for voting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> candidate. In April, division deputy commander for armaments Colonel Andrei Shtakal shot himself after being criticized by Surovikin. In both cases, a military prosecutor found no evidence of guilt. From June 2004, he led the 42nd Guards Motor Rifle Division, stationed in Chechnya. On several occasions when subordinate commanders committed crimes, including after the Borozdinovskaya operation, Surovikin justified his actions. He was the {{chief of staff of the}} 20th Guards Army from 2005. In April 2008, he became the army commander. In November 2008, Surovikin became head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff.

500|$|KMFDM is an initialism for the {{nonsensical}} and grammatically incorrect German phrase Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, which, {{keeping the}} same word order, [...] literally translates as [...] "no majority for the pity", but is typically given the loose translation of [...] "no pity for the majority".

[...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction.

This would obviously violate the Fourth Amendment rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions {{would not be able to}} sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well.

500|$|Michael Rutter made a {{significant}} contribution to the controversial issue of Bowlby's maternal deprivation hypothesis. His 1981 monograph and other papers comprise the definitive empirical evaluation and update of Bowlby's early work on maternal deprivation. He amassed further evidence, addressed the many different underlying social and psychological mechanisms and showed that Bowlby was only partially right and often <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons. Rutter highlighted the other forms of deprivation found in institutional care and the complexity of separation distress; and suggested that anti-social behaviour was not linked to maternal deprivation as such but to family discord. The importance of these refinements of the maternal deprivation hypothesis was to reposition it as a [...] "vulnerability factor" [...] rather than a causative agent, with a number of varied influences determining which path a child would take.|$|E
