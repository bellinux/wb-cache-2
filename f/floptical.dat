5000|$|Support of <b>Floptical</b> drives {{is present}} in all Microsoft Windows NT {{operating}} systems up to Windows 2000, where it figures as 20.8 MB drive format option in the FORMAT command options. The FORMAT command in Windows XP and newer lacks support of the <b>Floptical</b> drive. [...] <b>Floptical</b> support exists in SCO OpenServer as well. SCSI-equipped Macintosh computers could boot from a Mac operating system installed on a floptical; a formatting utility application was provided to erase and format <b>floptical</b> disks. Likewise, Silicon Graphics's IRIX operating system includes <b>floptical</b> support.|$|E
50|$|One {{option for}} the Indy is a <b>floptical</b> drive. The <b>floptical</b> uses 21 MB disks, but is able {{to read and write}} {{standard}} magnetic floppies as well.|$|E
50|$|Insite {{licensed}} the <b>floptical</b> {{technology to}} a number of companies, including Matsushita, Iomega, Maxell/Hitachi and others. A number of these companies later formed the <b>Floptical</b> Technology Association, or FTA, to try to have the format adopted as a replacement of standard floppy disks.|$|E
50|$|Iomega {{licensed}} the <b>floptical</b> {{technology as}} early as 1989 and produced a compatible drive known as the Insider.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} {{floppy disk}} and optical disc, {{known as a}} <b>Floptical</b> disk exists. The size of a -inch (90 mm) disk, {{they are capable of}} holding close to 20.8 MB, but need a special drive.|$|E
50|$|There {{was serious}} {{consideration}} {{that one of}} these systems would succeed where the <b>Floptical</b> failed and replace the standard floppy disk outright, but the rapid introduction of writable CD-ROM systems in the early 2000s made the market disappear.|$|E
5000|$|The Indy has two {{drive bay}}s for 1-inch tall 3.5" [...] drives. The upper drive bay is {{externally}} accessible and may hold a SCSI <b>floptical</b> drive. All {{external and internal}} drives share a single Fast SCSI bus (unless a GIO32 SCSI card has been installed).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Floptical</b> {{technology was}} announced in 1988 and introduced late in 1991 by Insite Peripherals, a venture funded company set up by Jim Adkisson, {{one of the key}} engineers behind the original 5¼-inch floppy disk drive development at Shugart Associates in 1976. The main shareholders were Maxell, Iomega and 3M.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Floptical</b> {{refers to}} a type of floppy disk drive that {{combines}} magnetic and optical technologies to store data on media similar to standard 3½-inch floppy disks. The name is a portmanteau of the words [...] "floppy" [...] and [...] "optical". It refers specifically to one brand of drive and disk system, but is also used more generically to refer to any system using similar techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Around [...] Insite flopticals are {{believed}} to have been sold worldwide in the product's lifetime. Silicon Graphics used them in their SGI Indigo and SGI Indy series of computer workstations. It was also reported that Commodore International had selected the Insite <b>Floptical</b> for its Amiga 3000. However, this did not take place, and while Flopticals were installed in many Amiga systems, they were sold by either Insite, TTR Development or Digital Micronics (DMI), and not bundled by Commodore.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the SuperDisk system came from an early 1990s project at Iomega. It {{is one of the}} last {{examples}} of <b>floptical</b> technology, where lasers are used to guide a magnetic head which is much smaller than those used in traditional floppy disk drives. Iomega orphaned the project around the time they decided to release the Zip drive in 1994. The idea eventually ended up at 3M, where the concept was refined and the design was licensed to established floppy drive makers Matsushita and Mitsubishi. Other companies involved in the development of SuperDisk include Compaq and OR Technology.|$|E
5000|$|To {{allow for}} {{a high degree of}} {{compatibility}} with existing SCSI host adapters, <b>Floptical</b> drives were designed to work as a standard floppy disk drive, and not as a removable hard disk. To ensure this, a [...] "write lockout" [...] feature was added in the firmware. This effectively inhibits writing (including any kind of formatting) of the media. It is possible to unlock the drive by issuing a SCSI Mode Sense Command, 1A 00 20 02 A0. It is unclear how much of a problem this is, and Insite also issued EPROMs where this [...] "feature" [...] was not present.|$|E
5000|$|Magneto-optical drives are not <b>Floptical</b> drives, which {{likewise}} combine ferromagnetic {{and optical}} technologies, albeit {{in a different}} manner. Flopticals are 21 megabyte 3.5" [...] magnetic diskettes using optical tracks to increase the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to 1,250 tracks per inch. No laser or heating is involved; a simple infrared LED is used to follow the optical tracks, while a magnetic head touches the recording surface. The drives can also read and write traditional 3.5" [...] diskettes, although not the 2.88 megabyte variety. Flopticals were manufactured by Insite Peripherals, a company founded by Jim Burke.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} involves {{reading and}} writing data magnetically, while optically aligning the read/write head in the drive using grooves in the disk being sensed by an infrared LED and sensor (a form of visual servo). The magnetic head touches the recording surface, {{as it does in}} a normal floppy drive. The optical servo tracks allow for an increase in the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to [...] tracks per inch. <b>Floptical</b> disks provide 21 MB of storage. The drive has a second set of read/write heads so that it can read from and write to standard 720 kB and 1.44 MB ( [...] KiB) disks as well.|$|E
