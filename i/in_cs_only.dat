40|$|ABSTRACT: Normalisation of {{eosinophil}} {{counts in}} sputum of asthmatic patients reduces eosinophilic exacerbations. However, {{the effect of}} this strategy on airway remodelling remains to be determined. We compared bronchial inflammation and collagen deposition after 2 yrs of treatment guided by either sputum eosinophils (sputum strategy, SS) or by clinical criteria (clinical strategy, CS). As a pilot study, 20 mild asthmatic patients were randomly assigned to CS or SS strategies. Bronchial biopsies were obtained when minimum treatment needed to maintain control was identified and this was continued for 2 yrs. Biopsies were immunostained for inflammatory cells, mucin 5 A (MUC 5 A) and collagen. The mean dose of inhaled corticosteroids at the start and end of the study was similar in both SS and CS groups. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s increased in both groups at the study end. In SS, mucosal lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, but not neutrophils, were reduced {{at the end of the}} study. <b>In</b> <b>CS,</b> <b>only</b> activated eosinophil and neutrophil counts decreased. MUC 5 A staining decreased in SS but not CS. No change in collagen deposition underneath the basement membrane was observed in either strategy. Treatment strategies that normalise sputum eosinophils also reduce mucosal inflammatory cells and MUC 5 A expression, but do not change subepithelial collagen deposition in mild to moderate asthma...|$|E
40|$|P>Background Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} {{caused by}} classic 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (21 OHD) is an autosomal recessive disorder {{with a high}} prevalence of asymptomatic heterozygote carriers (HTZ) in the general population, making case detection desirable by routine methodology. HTZ for classic and nonclassic (NC) forms have basal and ACTH-stimulated values of 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) that fail to discriminate them from the general population. 21 -Deoxycortisol (21 DF), an 11 -hydroxylated derivative of 17 OHP, is an alternative approach to identify 21 OHD HTZ. Objective To determine the discriminating value of basal and ACTH-stimulated serum levels of 21 DF in comparison with 17 OHP in a population of HTZ for 21 OHD (n = 60), {{as well as in}} NC patients (n = 16) and in genotypically normal control subjects (CS, n = 30), using fourth generation tandem mass spectrometry after HPLC separation (LC-MS/MS).

Similar to 17 OHP, ACTH-stimulated 21 DF levels did not overlap between HTZ and NC patients. A positive and highly significant correlation (r = 0 center dot 846; P < 0 center dot 001) was observed between 21 DF and 17 OHP pairs of values from NC and HTZ. Conclusion This study confirms the superiority of ACTH-stimulated 21 DF, when compared to 17 OHP, both measured by LC-MS/MS, in identifying carriers for 21 OHD. Serum 21 DF is a useful tool in genetic counselling to screen carriers among relatives in families with affected subjects, giving support to molecular results.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} whether desferrioxamine decreases ischemia and perfusion injury aggravated by cold storage (CS) in a rat liver perfusion model. METHODS: Isolated rat livers {{were kept in}} CS in University of Wisconsin Solution for 20 h at 4 &#x 2005; 0;C, then exposed to 25 min of warm ischemia (WI) at 37 &#x 2005; 0;C followed by 2 h of warm perfusion (WP) at 37 &#x 2005; 0;C with oxygenated (95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide) Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, was added {{at different stages of}} storage, ischemia and perfusion: <b>in</b> <b>CS</b> <b>only,</b> in WI only, in WP only, in WI and perfusion, or in all stages. Effluent samples were collected after CS and after WI. Perfusate samples and bile were collected every 30 min (0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 h) during liver perfusion. Cellular injury was assessed by the determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the effluent and perfusate samples. Total iron was analysed in the perfusate samples. After WP, the liver was collected for the determination of liver swelling (wet to dry ratio) and liver morphological examination (hematoxylin and eosin staining). RESULTS: Increased CS time caused increased liver dysfunction during WP. After 2 h of WP, liver injury was indicated by increased release of AST (0. 5 h CS: 9. 4 1; 2. 2 U/g liver vs 20 h CS: 45. 9 1; 10. 8 U/g liver, P < 0. 05) and LDH (0. 5 h CS: 59 1; 14 U/g liver vs 20 h CS: 297 1; 71 U/g liver, P < 0. 05). There was an associated increase in iron release into the perfusate (0. 5 h CS: 0. 11 1; 0. 03 &#x 3 BC;moL/g liver vs 20 h CS: 0. 58 1; 0. 10 &#x 3 BC;moL/g liver, P < 0. 05) and reduction in bile flow (0. 5 h CS: 194 1; 12 &#x 3 BC;L/g vs 20 h CS: 71 1; 8 &#x 3 BC;L/g liver, P < 0. 05). When DFO was added during WI and WP following 20 h of CS, release of iron into the perfusate was decreased (DFO absent 0. 58 1; 0. 10 &#x 3 BC;moL/g liver vs DFO present 0. 31 1; 0. 06 &#x 3 BC;moL/g liver, P < 0. 05), and liver function substantially improved with decreased release of AST (DFO absent 45. 9 1; 10. 8 U/g liver vs DFO present 8. 1 1; 0. 9 U/g liver, P < 0. 05) and LDH (DFO absent 297 1; 71 U/g liver vs DFO present 56 1; 7 U/g liver, P < 0. 05), and increased bile flow (DFO absent 71 1; 8 &#x 3 BC;L/g liver vs DFO present 237 1; 36 &#x 3 BC;L/g liver, P < 0. 05). DFO was also shown to improve liver morphology after WP. Cellular injury (the release of LDH and AST) was significantly reduced with the addition of DFO in CS medium but to a lesser extent compared to the addition of DFO in WP or WI and perfusion. There was no effect on liver swelling or bile flow when DFO was only added to the CS medium. CONCLUSION: DFO added during WI and perfusion decreased liver perfusion injury aggravated by extended CS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} examine the effects of {{endurance}} training on the ultrastructural characteristics of skeletal muscle in heart transplant recipients (HTRs) and age-matched control subjects (C). Background. Deconditioning is one of the factors involved in the peripheral limitation of exercise capacity of HTRs, and training has proven to be beneficial. Methods. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle, analyzed by ultrastructural morphometry, and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area, assessed by computed tomography (CT), were performed in 12 HTRs and 7 age-matched C before and 6 weeks after an endurance training program. Maximal oxygen uptake (peak V̇O 2) was determined by an incremental exercise test. Additionally muscle biopsies were performed before and after a 6 -week control period in four HTRs to check for spontaneous improvement. Results. Training resulted in similar increases in peak V̇O 2 (11 % in HTRs, 8. 5 % <b>in</b> <b>C),</b> ventilatory threshold (23 % in HTRs, 32 % <b>in</b> <b>C)</b> and total endurance work (54 % in HTRs, 31 % <b>in</b> <b>C).</b> Volume density of total mitochondria increased significantly (26 % in HTRs, 33 % <b>in</b> <b>C)</b> with a predominant increase of subsarcolemmal mitochondrial volume density (74 % in HTRs, 70 % <b>in</b> <b>C).</b> The capillary/fiber ratio increased by 19 % <b>in</b> <b>C</b> <b>only.</b> <b>In</b> the nontrained group, none of the structural markers was spontaneously modified. Conclusions. Six weeks of endurance training <b>in</b> HTRs and <b>C</b> led to similar improvements of aerobic work capacity. However, the decreased muscular capillary network in HTRs remained unchanged with training.

Two independent deletions were constructed for each target gene. Growth in > 40 conditions was tested, including carbon source, temperature, and the presence of antifungal drugs. The phenotypes were compared to C. albicans strains with deletions of orthologous transcription factors. We found that many phenotypes are shared between the two species, such as the role of Upc 2 as a regulator of azole resistance, and of CAP 1 in the oxidative stress response. Others are unique to one species. For example, Cph 2 plays a role in the hypoxic response <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> parapsilosis but not <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> albicans. We found extensive divergence between the biofilm regulators of the two species.
