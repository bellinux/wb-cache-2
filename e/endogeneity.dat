[...] While SNAP participants and other low-income nonparticipants spend similar amounts on food spending, SNAP participants tend to still experience greater food insecurity than nonparticipants. This is believed to be a reflection of welfare of individuals who take the time to apply for SNAP benefits than the shortcomings of SNAP. In other words, households facing the greatest hardships are the most likely to bear of the burden of applying for program benefits. Statistical models that control for this <b>endogeneity</b> suggest that SNAP receipt reduces the likelihood of being food insecure and very food insecure by roughly 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{effectiveness}} of tobacco advertisement is widely documented. According to Henry Saffer, public health {{experts say that}} tobacco advertising increases cigarette consumption and there is much empirical literature that finds a significant effect of tobacco advertising on smoking, especially in children. However, Saffer and Chaloupka's empirical results are largely due to [...] "data mining" [...] and do not account for <b>endogeneity</b> of bans. A meta-analysis of the econometric literature is found in J.P. Nelson, [...] "Cigarette Advertising Regulation: A Meta-Analysis," [...] International Review of Law and Economics, 26(2), June 2006, pp.195–226.

2500|$|Other reviews {{said that}} there were {{problems}} with Lott's model. In the New England Journal of Medicine, David Hemenway argued that Lott failed to account for several key variables, including drug consumption, and that therefore the model was flawed. Ian Ayres and John J. Donohue, said that the model used by Lott contained significant coding errors and systemic bias. In the American Journal of Public Health, Daniel Webster et al. also raised concerns about other flaws in the study, such as misclassification of laws and <b>endogeneity</b> of predictor variables, which they said rendered the study's conclusions [...] "insupportable". Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck considered it unlikely that such a large decrease in violent crime could be explained by a relatively modest increase in concealed carry, and others said that removing portions of the data set caused the results to still show statistically significant drops only in aggravated assaults and robbery when all counties with fewer than 100,000 people and Florida's counties were both simultaneously dropped from the sample. A 1998 study by Jens Ludwig that said it [...] "more effectively control for unobserved variables that may vary over time" [...] than the Lott and Mustard study concluded that [...] "shall-issue laws have resulted, if anything, in an increase in adult homicide rates." [...] A 2001 study in the Journal of Political Economy by University of Chicago economist Mark Duggan did robustness checks of Lott and Mustard's study and found that the findings of the Lott and Mustard study were inaccurate.|$|E
5000|$|In econometrics, an <b>endogeneity</b> problem {{occurs when}} an {{explanatory}} variable is {{correlated with the}} error term. [...] <b>Endogeneity</b> can arise {{as a result of}} measurement error, autoregression with autocorrelated errors, simultaneous causality (see Instrumental variable) and omitted variables. Two common causes of <b>endogeneity</b> are: 1) an uncontrolled confounder causing both independent and dependent variables of a model; and 2) a loop of causality between the independent and dependent variables of a model.|$|E

5000|$|Control {{functions}} are statistical methods to correct for <b>endogeneity</b> problems by modelling the <b>endogeneity</b> in the error term. The approach thereby differs {{in important ways}} from other models that try {{to account for the}} same econometric problem. Instrumental variables, for example, attempt to model the endogenous variable X as an often invertible model with respect to a relevant and exogenous instrument Z. Panel data use special data properties to difference out unobserved heterogeneity that is assumed to be fixed over time.|$|E

5000|$|Since both [...] and [...] {{depend on}} , they are correlated, so the OLS {{estimation}} of [...] will be biased downward. Measurement {{error in the}} dependent variable, however, does not cause <b>endogeneity</b> (though it does increase the variance of the error term).|$|E
5000|$|If v is {{correlated}} with x, for instance, v denotes the advertisement cost which has strong interactive {{relationship with the}} demand side, then estimation through the Tobit model without considering the neglected heterogeneity will cause an <b>endogeneity</b> issue implicitly.

5000|$|In this case, the <b>endogeneity</b> {{comes from}} an {{uncontrolled}} confounding variable. A variable is correlated with both an independent variable in the model, and with the error term.

50|$|The APE can be {{computed}} correspondingly. The {{key idea}} {{here is to}} use the first-stage regression to purify the error term and then estimate the model without the <b>endogeneity</b> issue based on the assumption about the correlation structure.

5000|$|In many cases, {{there is}} an unobservable {{heterogeneity}} in the probit model. For instance, when modelling the consumption choice of a certain brand, consumers’ personal preference is unobserved but needs {{to be considered in}} the model.

50|$|Extensions to this {{cross-sectional}} model {{have been provided}} that allow for taking into account important econometric issues, such as endogenous explanatory variables and unobserved heterogeneous effects. Under strict exogeneity assumptions, {{it is possible to}} difference out these unobserved effects using panel data techniques, although weaker exogeneity assumptions can also result in consistent estimators. Two step control function techniques to deal with <b>endogeneity</b> concerns have also been proposed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{presence}} of the lagged dependent variable violates strict exogeneity, that is, <b>endogeneity</b> may occur. The fixed effect estimator and the first differences estimator both rely on the assumption of strict exogeneity. Hence, if [...] {{is believed to be}} correlated with one of the dependent variables, an alternative estimation technique must be used. Instrumental variables or GMM techniques are commonly used in this situation, such as the Arellano-Bond estimator.|$|E
5000|$|Geometrically, this {{assumptions}} {{implies that}} [...] and [...] are orthogonal to each other, {{so that their}} inner product (i.e., their cross moment) is zero.This assumption is violated if the explanatory variables are stochastic, for instance when they are measured with error, or are endogenous. <b>Endogeneity</b> can {{be the result of}} simultaneity, where causality flows back and forth between both the dependent and independent variable. Instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem.|$|E
50|$|For example, in {{a simple}} supply and demand model, when {{predicting}} the quantity demanded in equilibrium, the price is endogenous because producers change their price in response to demand and consumers change their demand in response to price. In this case, the price variable {{is said to have}} total <b>endogeneity</b> once the demand and supply curves are known. In contrast, a change in consumer tastes or preferences would be an exogenous change on the demand curve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endogeneity</b> of savings:Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} parameter in the Harrod-Domar model is the rate of savings. Can it {{be treated as a}} parameter that can be manipulated easily by policy? That depends on how much control the policy maker has over the economy. In fact, there are several reasons to believe that the rate of savings may itself be influenced by the overall level of per capita income in the society, not to mention the distribution of that income among the population.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{population}} figures in a dataset comprising 276 {{cities in the}} years 1300-1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth.

In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the <b>endogeneity</b> of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.|$|E

5000|$|In econometrics, when <b>endogeneity</b> is {{a concern}} in a dynamic panel data framework, it is {{possible}} to exploit the panel data structure of the data to deal with this issue. Examples include (but are not limited to) data over time on capital investment or wage equations. The first differencing approach to instrumental variables, also referred to as first-difference two-stage least squares (FD2SLS), was first proposed by Anderson and Hsiao (1982) [...] and later extended by Arellano and Bond (1991). The key problem the attempt address, is the problem of as predetermined regressors.|$|E
50|$|The <b>endogeneity</b> {{problem is}} {{particularly}} relevant {{in the context}} of time series analysis of causal processes. It is common for some factors within a causal system to be dependent for their value in period t on the values of other factors in the causal system in period t &minus; 1. Suppose that the level of pest infestation is independent of all other factors within a given period, but is influenced by the level of rainfall and fertilizer in the preceding period. In this instance it would be correct to say that infestation is exogenous within the period, but endogenous over time.|$|E
50|$|If we {{reject the}} null hypothesis, {{it means that}} b1 is inconsistent. This test {{can be used to}} check for the <b>endogeneity</b> of a {{variable}} (by comparing instrumental variable (IV) estimates to ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates). It {{can also be used to}} check the validity of extra instruments by comparing IV estimates using a full set of instruments Z to IV estimates that use a proper subset of Z. Note that in order for the test to work in the latter case, we must be certain of the validity of the subset of Z and that subset must have enough instruments to identify the parameters of the equation.|$|E
50|$|The intuition {{behind the}} RDD is well {{illustrated}} using {{the evaluation of}} merit-based scholarships. The main problem with estimating the causal effect of such an intervention is the <b>endogeneity</b> of performance to the assignment of treatment (e.g. scholarship award): Since high-performing {{students are more likely}} to be awarded the merit scholarship and continue performing well at the same time, comparing the outcomes of awardees and non-recipients would lead to an upward bias of the estimates. Even if the scholarship did not improve grades at all, awardees would have performed better than non-recipients, simply because scholarships were given to students who were performing well ex ante.|$|E

50|$|This {{evidence}} {{is consistent with}} the idea that appellate judges' offsetting biases make common law unbiased but volatile and thus more efficient than the certain civil law only when the latter is sufficiently distorted by the lobbying activities of special interests, i.e., when preferences are sufficiently heterogeneous and/or the political process sufficiently inefficient (Guerriero, 2016a). These results cast several doubts on the putative primacy of common law and suggest that comparative law and economics should not only take into account the evolving nature of legal traditions and their <b>endogeneity</b> to preference diversity and the quality of political institutions, but also the nature of the performance of interest. Guerriero (2016b) shows that properly considering these points delivers conclusions very different from those drawn by La Porta et al. (2008).|$|E
