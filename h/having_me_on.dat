However, the singer stated that while the perfume {{was based on the}} molecular structure of the two substances, it would not smell of them. She further explained that the blood element was based on a sample her own blood molecules to create [...] "a sense of <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> your skin". Rather than blood and semen, she said that the perfume would smell like an [...] "expensive hooker". The packaging lists the perfume's notes as [...] "tears of belladonna, crushed heart of tiger orchidea with a black veil of incense, pulverized apricot and the combinative essences of saffron and honey drops". According to the product packaging, instead of the pyramidal structure used in most perfumes, Lady Gaga Fame uses [...] "push-pull technology", where the ingredients demonstrate aspects of each note without precedence. Rather than utilizing top, middle, and base notes, the perfume is based on three accords – [...] "dark" [...] (containing the Belladonna notes), [...] "sensual" [...] (containing the honey, saffron, and apricot notes), and [...] "light" [...] (containing the Tiger Orchid notes) which come together to produce a floral, fruity scent.|$|E

I invented it on a hint I got from a girl who undertakes the floral decorations for parties. I didn't see why some one shouldn't furnish suggestions for amusements, as well as flowers. I was always rather lucky at that in my own fam--at my father's--" [...] She pulled herself sharply up, as if danger lay that way. [...] "I got an introduction to Mrs. Westangle, and she's to let me try. I {{am going to}} her simply as part of the catering, and I'm not to have any recognition in the hospitalities. So it wasn't necessary for her to send for me at the station, except as a means of <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the ground in good season. I have to thank you for that, and--I thank you." [...] She ended in a sigh.|$|E

Maybe it's time {{to go public with}} the 'great and the good' who caused heartache and misery to so many gay people? … I am sick to death of RTE now being the benign channel of acceptance of homosexuality when it was a bastion of creaking, ancient codes. It was fine to be a woman Director at RTE….just not a GAY one!

5000|$|A 1974 live {{version was}} {{recorded}} by the Elton John Band with John Lennon and released as the B-side to the former's [...] "Philadelphia Freedom" [...] single. The song {{is available on the}} Lennon box set, and on Elton John's To Be Continued... box set as well as the expanded CD edition of his 1976 live album Here and There and Elton John's Rare Masters. Lennon's introduction: I'd like to thank Elton and the boys for <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> tonight. We tried to think of a number to finish off with so I can get out of here and be sick, and we thought we'd do a number of an old, estranged fiancé of mine, called Paul. This is one I never sang, it's an old Beatle number, and we just about know it. This was the last major live performance by John Lennon. After Lennon's death, the track was released as a single and reached #40 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, making it the first time that any version of the song had entered the UK charts.|$|E

5000|$|The week of October 17-21 in 1966—that {{would make}} me about 40—was a special celebrity week on Eye Guess. Bill Cullen was the host. The game was very similar to Concentration. I was teamed up with Julia Meade. Remember her? Actress, very pretty young lady, blonde... Okay, never mind. I don't think I won, but I did get the take-home game. Anyway, the show is over, and I start walking toward the podium to say good night to Bill, {{to thank him for}} <b>having</b> <b>me</b> <b>on.</b> He starts coming toward me cross-stage, and I don't know what he's doing. His feet are flopping. His hands are flying everywhere. He's doing this kind of wacky walk-of-the-unfortunates that Jerry Lewis used to do. So I figured, what the hell, I'll join him. I start doing, I dunno, this multiple-sclerosis walk, {{flapping}} my arms and doing the Milton Berle cross legs—my own Jerry Lewis impression... And Julia is whispering, [...] "No! He's crippled, Mel!" [...] I don't even hear her. Finally we meet in the middle, we hug, and he says to me, [...] "You know, you're the only comic who's ever had the nerve to make fun of my crippled walk. Everyone's so careful, it makes me feel even worse." [...] And I realize, Oh, my God, this guy is really crippled! It was my worst moment — and if you weren't me, probably the funniest thing that ever happened.|$|E
