5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus <b>Enterovirus</b> known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E

According to the calculations the emission of <b>enteroviruses</b> can effectively be reduced by further reduction of direct discharge. To recommend measurements for improvement of watewater treatment data about the efficiency of the removal of <b>enteroviruses</b> are insufficiently available. Modelling of the dispersion of <b>enteroviruses</b> in surface water gave concentrations of <b>enteroviruses</b> that were very similar to measured concentrations in the large rivers. However, the calculations are still too uncertain to be able to draw conclusions concerning the quality of water for recreational purposes or for the drinking water supply.

40|$|<b>Enteroviruses</b> are a {{group of}} positive-sense single {{stranded}} viruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family. Most <b>enteroviruses</b> infect humans from the gastrointestinal tract and cause mild symptoms. However, several <b>enteroviruses</b> can invade {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and result in various neurological symptoms that are correlated to mortality associated with enteroviral infections. In recent years, large outbreaks of <b>enteroviruses</b> occurred worldwide. Therefore, these neurotropic <b>enteroviruses</b> have been deemed as re-emerging pathogens. Although these viruses are becoming large threats to public health, our understanding of these viruses, especially for non-polio <b>enteroviruses,</b> is limited. In this article, we review recent advances in the trafficking of these pathogens from the peripheral to the central nervous system, compare their cell tropism, and discuss the effects of viral infections in their host neuronal cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Enteroviruses</b> can shed in feces {{for several}} weeks, so many excrete viruses can remain {{infectious}} {{for a long}} time in environment.

5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and <b>Enterovirus</b> to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enteroviruses</b> {{are by far}} {{the most}} common causes of aseptic {{meningitis}} in children. In the United States, <b>enteroviruses</b> are responsible for 30,000 to 50,000 meningitis hospitalizations per year as a result of 30 million to 50 million infections.|$|R
25|$|Adenoviruses is {{the most}} common cause of viral {{conjunctivitis}} (adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis). Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis (caused by herpes simplex viruses) can be serious and requires treatment with acyclovir. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses, <b>Enterovirus</b> 70 and Coxsackievirus A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} blood-borne infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include Listeria monocytogenes and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and <b>enterovirus</b> can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E
25|$|A {{preceding}} antigenic challenge can {{be identified}} in approximately two-thirds of people. Viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, <b>enterovirus,</b> measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, and coxsackievirus; while the bacterial infections include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Leptospira, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci. The only vaccine proven to induce ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. The majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with ADEM onset use small samples or case studies. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. In rare cases, ADEM seems to follow from organ transplantation. An upper bound for the risk of ADEM from measles vaccination, if it exists, can be estimated to be 10 per million, which is far lower than {{the risk of developing}} ADEM from an actual measles infection, which is about 1 per 1,000 cases. For a rubella infection, the risk is 1 per 5,000 cases. Some early vaccines, later shown to have been contaminated with host animal CNS tissue, had ADEM incident rates as high as 1 in 600.|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the major}} health impact of <b>enteroviruses,</b> {{sensitive}} and reliable techniques for the detection and identification of this large group of closely related viruses are essential. To date <b>enteroviruses</b> have generally been isolated by cell culture propagation and typed by neutralization tests using specific antisera. Inoculation of newborn mice remains the most common procedure to distinguish between Coxsackie A and B viruses. These techniques have major shortcomings. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and assess molecular techniques for the detection and serotyping of cytopathogenic as well as non-cytopathogenic <b>enteroviruses</b> from environmental water samples.

500|$|Poliovirus is an <b>enterovirus.</b> Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, {{meaning that}} one ingests the virus and viral {{replication}} {{occurs in the}} alimentary tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads {{to the development of}} minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists [...] from days to weeks prior to recovery.|$|E

2500|$|A {{picornavirus}} is a virus {{belonging to}} the family Picornaviridae, [...] a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Vertebrates, including humans, serve as natural hosts. Picornaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that represent a large family of small, cytoplasmic, plus-strand RNA(~7.5kb) viruses with a 30nm icosahedral capsid. Its genome {{does not have a}} lipid membrane. Picornaviruses are found in mammals and birds. There are currently 80 species in this family, divided among 35 genera. These include the <b>Enterovirus,</b> Aphthovirus, Cardiovirus, Rhinovirus and Hepatovirus genera. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including paralysis, meningitis, hepatitis and poliomyelitis. Picornaviruses are in Baltimore IV class. Their genome single-stranded (+) sense RNA is that functions as mRNA after entry into the cell and all viral mRNA synthesized is of genome polarity. The mRNA encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This polymerase makes complementary minus strands of RNA, then uses them as templates to make more plus strands. So, an overview of the steps in picornavirus replication are in order: attachment, entry, translation, transcription/genome replication (one and the same process), assembly and exit.|$|E
