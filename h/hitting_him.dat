5000|$|Futch and his assistant, George Benton, {{believed}} {{that the key to}} winning the fight would be for Frazier to persistently attack Ali's body, including punches to the hips when Ali effectively covered up his torso along the ropes.

5|$|The {{first game}} was close at the halfway point, Ottawa leading Dawson three to one. In the second half, the play became violent.

5|$|In {{the opening}} match of the 1931–32 season, which was against Queensland, New South Wales were in trouble. Gilbert famously knocked the bat out of Donald Bradman's hand, before {{removing}} {{him for a}} duck. Gilbert cut down the New South Wales top order with a spell of 3/12 and forced Alan Kippax to retire hurt after <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> in the upper body. Fingleton {{was going to be}} twelfth man before Archie Jackson—who was to die of tuberculosis just over a year later—collapsed just {{before the start of the}} match. Undeterred, Stan McCabe came in and counterattacked; Fingleton assisted him with a stubborn 93 and featured in a 195-run fourth wicket partnership. New South Wales reached 432 and won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{finds out}} from a county sheriff that Paul, her abusive ex-husband who {{attacked}} her the night before, is pressing charges against her for assault. She talks with a lawyer, who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her intent was to defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, Jourdan {{experienced}} a setback in the north, during a clash at Sulzbach on 17 August, when Paul Kray's Austrians inflicted losses of 1,000 killed and wounded and 700 captured on their enemies while suffering losses of 900 killed and wounded and 200 captured. Despite the French losses, the French continued their advance. Wartensleben's army retreated behind the Naab River on 18 August and, as Jourdan closed {{up to the}} Naab, he posted Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's division at Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz to observe Charles, hoping that would keep the Austrians from <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> by surprise. Unbeknownst to them, though, south of the Danube, Charles received reinforcements that brought his strength up to 60,000 troops. He left 35,000 soldiers {{under the command of}} Latour to contain the Army of the Rhine and Moselle along the Danube.|$|E

60|$|The {{constant}} {{repetition of}} this maxim gradually drove it into Sheen's head, so that {{towards the end}} of the lesson he no longer lowered his right hand when he led with his left; and he felt the gentle pressure of Joe Bevan's glove less frequently. At no stage of a pupil's education did Joe Bevan <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> really hard, and in the first few lessons he could scarcely be said to <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> at all. He merely rested his glove against the pupil's face. On the other hand, he was urgent in imploring the pupil to <b>hit</b> <b>him</b> as hard as he could.|$|R
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers 49–3 in their opening playoff game. Favored by only three points, the Giants caught a break when 49ers WR Jerry Rice fumbled an apparent touchdown catch-and-carry off his knee {{early in the}} game, then dominated the Niners {{the rest of the}} way. Their defense held the 49ers to 29yards rushing, 184yards in total offense, and 2 of 14 on third-down conversions. The Giants did not commit a turnover and totalled 216 rushing yards. Jim Burt knocked 49ers quarterback Joe Montana out of the game in the second quarter, <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> as he threw a pass which Lawrence Taylor intercepted and returned 34yards for a touchdown. The Giants defense also held the 49ers to only nine first downs, and 15 of 37 passing for zero touchdowns and three interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before {{compiling}} a hard-hitting 84. Coming in to join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller, <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> over the sightscreen with straight drives from consecutive balls and lofting a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} campaign, Edler {{improved to}} career-highs of 37 assists, first among team defensemen, and 42 points, second to Christian Ehrhoff. He missed six games near {{the midpoint of}} the campaign due to a left arm injury, sustained in December 2009. In the post-season, he added six points in 12 games as the Canucks lost again in the second round to the Blackhawks. Edler was injured in the sixth and deciding game of the series after opposing forward Dustin Byfuglien stepped on his right ankle after <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> along the boards. Requiring a walking cast for five weeks, he rehabilitated his ankle during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when {{he was able to}} execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified for <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said Waller had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that Davis had refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter. Though the match was billed as a Last Team Standing match, it was held under Texas Death match rules. A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels pinned Storm following <b>hitting</b> <b>him</b> in the knee with a steel chair to begin the ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. With the outcome of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to begin the ten count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E
