50|$|The chapter {{presents}} the metaphysical {{definition of a}} <b>human</b> <b>being</b> as Consciousness, Atman, Soul. In verse 3, it develops the foundation for this definition by explaining that speech cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the power of speech (dumb); that sight cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the ability of sight (blind); that hearing cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the ability to hear (deaf); that mind cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are without the power of clear thinking (foolishness); that arms or legs cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who lose their arms or legs (cut in an accident). A being has life-force, which is consciousness. And that which is conscious, has life-force.|$|R

50|$|Professor György Márkus systematized Marx's {{ideas about}} needs as follows: humans are {{different}} from other animals because their vital activity, work, is mediated {{to the satisfaction of}} needs (an animal who manufactures tools to produce other tools or his/her satisfactors), which makes a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> a universal natural being capable to turn the whole nature into the subject of his/her needs and his/her activity, and develops his/her needs and abilities (essential human forces) and develops himself/herself, a historical-universal being. Work generates the breach of the animal subject-object fusion, thus generating the possibility of human conscience and self-conscience, which tend to universality (the universal conscious <b>being).</b> A <b>human</b> <b>being's</b> conditions as a social being are given by work, but not only by work as {{it is not possible to}} live like a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> without a relationship with others: work is social because <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> work for each other with means and abilities produced by prior generations. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> are also free entities able to accomplish, during their lifetime, the objective possibilities generated by social evolution, on the basis of their conscious decisions. Freedom should be understood both in a negative (freedom to decide and to establish relationships) and a positive sense (dominion over natural forces and development of human creativity) of the essential human forces. To sum up, the essential interrelated traits of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are: a) work is their vital activity; b) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are conscious beings; c) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are social beings; d) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> tend to universality, which manifests in the three previous traits and make <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> natural-historical-universal, social-universal and universal conscious entities, and e) <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are free.|$|R
