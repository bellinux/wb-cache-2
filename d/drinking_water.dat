Zoning by the degree of explorability of mineral <b>drinking</b> <b>waters</b> with subsequent forecast of finding new types of deposits in accordance with the State Standard 54316 – 2011 have been carried out. Mineral waters from the Permian deposits within the studied territory have been of primary practical interest. The most common mineral <b>drinking</b> <b>waters</b> are chloride-magnesium-calcium, sulfate magnesium-calcium, chloride sodium-calcium, carbonate hydro-chloride sodium-magnesium-calcium, calcium chloride, carbonate hydro-chloride sodium-magnesium-calcium. The behavior of chlorine and bicarbonate ions in mineral waters from the Romashkinskoe and Novo-Elkhovskoe oil deposits and from the bitumen deposits has been considered. The correlation and interdependence of the underground hydrosphere with other geological environments and technosphere have been demonstrated. Advice has been given on using mineral <b>drinking</b> <b>waters,</b> development of a hydromineral basis of bottling factories, and creation of health resort institutions with special analyses carried out in certified laboratories...|$|R

5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to <b>drinking</b> <b>water.</b> In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> in domestic tap water.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{classification}} of national level poverty-stricken counties, the intra-classification differences of different indicators’ contributions are larger than those of other classes, except for the housing indicator; the inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those}} of other classes, except for the two indicators of <b>drinking</b> <b>water’s</b> safety and sanitary facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is quite larger among different poverty level of counties, while the internal difference among those counties at the same poverty level is comparatively smaller. In {{terms of the}} classification of minority autonomous counties, the intra-classification differences of indicators’ contributions are larger than those of historic revolutionary base classes, except for the indicators of adult’s illiteracy, <b>drinking</b> <b>water’s</b> safety and sanitary facilities. The inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those of}} other classes, except for <b>drinking</b> <b>water’s</b> safety and sanitary facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is greater between minority autonomous counties and non-minority autonomous counties, while the internal difference of the same classes is comparatively smaller. Overall, the poverty contributions of the two indicators, i.e., housing and adults’ illiteracy, show bigger intra-classification differences, while those of the other two indicators, <b>drinking</b> <b>water’s</b> availability and sanitary facilities, show bigger difference not only in intra-classification, but also in inter-classification. Which indicates there exist significant difference among those counties from three different classifications, as well as from the same classification, when regarding to the poverty degree of two indicators of <b>drinking</b> <b>water’s</b> availability and sanitary facilities.|$|R
