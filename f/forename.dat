5|$|Urse {{came from}} an undistinguished family, {{and made his way}} on {{military}} reputation. He was probably born in about 1040, but the exact date is unknown. He was from St Jean d'Abbetot in Normandy, where his family had lands, and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of Tancarville. Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d'Abetot and his wife Lesza, who held lands close to St Jean d'Abbetot in the early 12th century; despite the name, it is not certain that Robert d'Abetot was related to Urse. Urse had a brother usually called Robert Despenser, sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin, who also became a royal official. The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a <b>forename,</b> perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament. Urse's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy. His brother's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office, that of dispenser, in the royal household.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in Italy Meyerbeer became acquainted with, and {{impressed}} by, the works of his contemporary Gioachino Rossini, who by 1816, {{at the age of}} 24, was already director of both major opera houses in Naples and in the same year premiered his operas The Barber of Seville and Otello. Meyerbeer wrote a series of Italian operas on Rossinian models, including Romilda e Costanza (Padua, 1817), Semiramide riconosciuta (Turin, 1819), Emma di Resburgo (Venice, 1819), Margherita d'Anjou (Milan 1820) and L'esule di Granata (Milan 1821). All but the last two of these had libretti by Gaetano Rossi, whom Meyerbeer continued to support until the latter's death in 1855, although not commissioning any further libretti from him after Il crociato in Egitto (1824). During a visit to Sicily in 1816, Meyerbeer noted down a number of folksongs, and these in fact constitute the earliest collection of folk music of the region. In a birthday greeting from Rossi's wife in 1817 occurs the earliest use discovered of Meyerbeer's adopted <b>forename</b> 'Giacomo'.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{was born}} on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx (1777–1838) and Henrietta Pressburg (1788–1863). He was born at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, a town then part of the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of the Lower Rhine. Marx was ancestrally Jewish as his {{maternal}} grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx. His father, as a child known as Herschel, {{was the first in}} the line to receive a secular education and he became a lawyer and lived a relatively wealthy and middle-class existence, with his family owning a number of Moselle vineyards. Prior to his son's birth, and to escape the constraints of anti-semitic legislation, Herschel converted from Judaism to Lutheranism, the main Protestant denomination in Germany and Prussia at the time, taking on the German <b>forename</b> of Heinrich over the Yiddish Herschel. Marx was a third cousin once removed of German Romantic poet Heinrich Heine, also born to a German Jewish family in the Rhineland, with whom he became a frequent correspondent in later life.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was {{assisted}} by Edgar Pierre Jacobs, {{an artist who}} worked as part of Studios Hergé. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and {{his wife in the}} Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friend's - Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the <b>forename</b> of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>forenames</b> in Cameroon English speech. It {{examines}} {{the structure of}} people’s names, the sources and uses of <b>forenames,</b> the formation of pet-names, the orthographic representations of <b>forenames</b> and their phonological realisations. The graphic data come from the birth certificates of thousands of undergraduate students aged seventeen and above, and the phonic data are tape-recordings of GCE examinations results read over the Cameroon broadcasting corporation networks (CRTV). The analysis of the graphic data shows that some <b>forenames</b> were recorded inaccurately by semi-literate civil status officers, who usually spelt names as they were pronounced by parents or by themselves. The analysis of the phonic data does not only replicate the various findings described in recent studies of Cameroon English phonology such as glide formation and vowel epenthesis. It also reveals {{the widespread use of}} tonal features in the realisations of pet-names in Cameroon English speech...|$|R

25|$|Each surname {{can also}} be composite, the parts usually linked by the {{conjunction}} y or e (and), by the preposition de (of) or by a hyphen.

25|$|The patronymic exception:The current (1958) Spanish name law, Artículo 195 del Reglamento del Registro Civil (Article 195 of the Civil Registry Regulations) {{does not}} allow a person to prefix de to their surname, except as the {{clarifying}} addition of de to a surname (apellido) that might be misunderstood as a <b>forename</b> (nombre); thus, a child would be registered as Pedro de Miguel Jiménez, to avoid the surname Miguel being mistaken as {{the second part of}} a composite name, as Pedro Miguel.|$|E
25|$|The Registro Civil (Civil Registry) officially records a child's {{identity}} as {{composed of a}} <b>forename</b> (simple or composite) and the two surnames; however, a child can be religiously baptized with several forenames, e.g. Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos. Until the 1960s, it was customary to baptize children with three forenames: {{the first was the}} main and the only one used by the child; if parents agreed, one of the other two {{was the name of the}} day's saint. Nowadays, baptizing with three or more forenames is usually a royal and noble family practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{conjunction}} y avoids denominational confusion {{when the}} paternal surname {{might appear to}} be a (first) name; hence the physiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal might appear to be named Santiago Ramón (composite) and surnamed Cajal, likewise the jurist Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and the cleric Vicente Enrique y Tarancón. Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Martín Vázquez, when referred to by his surnames Martín Vázquez mistakenly appears to be forenamed Martín rather than Rafael, whilst, to his annoyance, the linguist Fernando Lázaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as Don Lázaro, rather than as Don Fernando (Lázaro can be either <b>forename</b> or surname).|$|E
25|$|The word molly (also spelt as molley, mollie, mally) is a pet-form of {{the female}} <b>forename</b> Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one {{is close to the}} word moll, {{designating}} a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form mollis, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.|$|E
40|$|Names, as proper nouns, {{are clearly}} {{important}} for the identification of individuals in everyday life. In the present article, I argue that <b>forenames</b> and surnames need also {{to be recognized as}} “doing” words, important in the categorization of sex at birth and in the ongoing management of gender conduct appropriate to sex category. Using evidence on personal naming practices in the United States and United Kingdom, I examine what happens at crisis points of sexed and gendered naming in the life course (for example, at the birth of babies, at marriage, and during gender-identity transitions). I show how <b>forenames</b> and surnames help in the embodied doing of gender and, likewise, that bodies are key to gendered practices of <b>forenaming</b> and surnaming: we have “gendered embodied named identities. ” Whether normative and compliant, pragmatic, or creative and resistant, <b>forenaming</b> and surnaming practices are revealed as core to the production and reproduction of binary sex categories and to gendered identities, difference, hierarchies, and inequalities.
