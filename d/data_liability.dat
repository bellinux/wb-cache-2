40|$|This chapter {{reports on}} the {{challenges}} and opportunities made possible by social media {{in the field of}} emergency management. First, we consider the emergency practitioner and the challenges they face when using social media: difficulties in verifying social media <b>data,</b> <b>liability</b> risks, information overload, and a lack of resources to manage social media communications and data. To address these challenges, we propose the use of performance measures, standards, best practices, digital volunteers, training, and exercises. Attention then turns to the research around social media in times of crisis. This research investigates public activity (citizen reporting, community-oriented computing, and collective intelligence and distributed problem solving) and demonstrates how social media have shaped—and continue to shape—perceptions around how members of the public can participate in an emergency. We then look at research that studies emergency management organizations as they seek to understand how social media might be used in their practice. We conclude with descriptions of future research directions and next-generation tools for monitoring and extracting information from social media. Finally, we discuss the differences between practice and research perspectives and discuss how these differences can make it difficult to reach consensus regarding social media’s role in emergency response. We advocate that as practice and research work together expanding the research agenda, understanding roles, building relationships, considering organizational fit, and developing best practices, they will advance knowledge about the potential and realities of social media and move toward envisioning how social media may be used as a resource in emergency management...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOnline services’ Terms of Use (ToU) or End-user Licence Agreements (EULA) {{are often}} unfair, abusive {{and hard to}} read for users. They are also {{difficult}} to draft for alternative projects willing to develop fair and clear policies for their contributors. This piece provides examples of original and alternative clauses, containing fair and unfair terms, addressing {{some of the most}} common issues faced by online platforms when developing their legal policies regarding ownership of user-generated content, protection of personal <b>data,</b> <b>liability</b> for third-party content, and other legal questions affecting users’ or consumers’ rights and their enforcement. While specific model clauses can’t be drafted to fit a plurality of activities without knowing the details of the platforms’ features and setting, projects and values, this piece provides guidelines and practical information to communities aiming for a wide-reaching, easy to understand licence, to empower informed choices prior to the definition of policies reflecting a variety of alternative politics that may be embraced by alternative internet platforms. Alternatives can be defined as the “range of (media) projects, intervention and networks that work against, or seek to develop different forms of, the dominant, expected (and broadly accepted) way of ‘doing’ (media) ” (Atton, 2004). Commons-based and privacy-enhancing or peer-to-peer services, as alternative to commercial services where users relinquish most of their rights, also need alternative policies in order not to deprive their users of their rights. Therefore, this contribution is intended to provide a practical, critical and normative contribution by proposing guidelines for platform developers drafting their terms of use. As a practical resource, it lists most clauses that are to be included in online terms of use. The objective to enclose a range of examples from the most abusive to the fairest for most of the topics aims at exemplifying worst as well as best practices. The definition of fair clauses is meant to implement the vision of platforms which respects users’ rights. My legal approach is grounded in commons-based peer production theory and practice from a continental European legal culture perspective, with the assumption that alternative internets have political concerns for freedom, autonomy, consent, privacy, independence, surveillance, asymmetries of power, security, unfair contractual and commercial practices and other fundamental rights. Neither universal nor exhaustive, and rather than legal advise, the purpose is to raise awareness on the possibility to draft alternative terms of use, in a context dominated by US corporate legal culture aiming at maximising profit and minimising risks (Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple). Instead of embracing a neoliberal agenda, alternative policies may rather try to support the development of sustainable services and products, seen as commons. Most Terms of Use show a diverse mix of all criteria and choices, and there are no caricatural pure evil commercial models or universally desirable commons-based alternatives, unilaterally advantaging or disadvantaging users at all levels. Finally, it follows the European Directive on unfair contract terms according to which contracts should be drafted in plain, intelligible language, which do not preclude validity and non-ambiguity...|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{professional}} liability insurance protects technology firms from litigation resulting from charges of professional negligence or failure to perform professional duties. Covered incidents may include errors and omissions that result {{in the loss of}} client data, software or system failure, claims of non-performance, negligent overselling of services, contents of a forum post or email of an employee that are incorrect or cause harm to a reputation, getting rid of office equipment such as fax machines without properly clearing their internal memory, or failing to notify customers that their private data has been breached.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} of the technology of computer and internet greatly facilitate the production and dissemination of images, text, audio, video and other digital media. The single watermarking algorithm of GIS vector data can’t meet people’s need in some aspects as featured in bad robustness. By making up the disadvantages of the traditional watermarking to some degree, the multiple watermarking can embed several watermarks in the host in one way or several ways. However, several multiple watermarking studies are centered on the multimedia, and less on GIS vector data. In this paper, by integrating with GIS vector data characterized by the requirement for data accurateness, has put forward four multiple watermarking solutions available to GIS vector data and verified them by experiments. The multiple watermarking combines the advantages of the single watermarking and enhances its robustness. The multiple watermarking has achieved the goal of providing multiple protections for GIS vector <b>data</b> with <b>liability</b> and feasibility. These methods can be efficiently applied to the copyright certification of other digital products based on the same principle. </p...|$|R
