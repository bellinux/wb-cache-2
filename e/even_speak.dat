25|$|In 1792, Kant's {{attempt to}} publish the Second of the four Pieces of Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason, in the journal Berlinische Monatsschrift, met with {{opposition}} from the King's censorship commission, which had been established that same year {{in the context of}} the French Revolution. Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at the University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship. This insubordination earned him a now famous reprimand from the King. When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> publicly about religion. Kant then published his response to the King's reprimand and explained himself, in the preface of The Conflict of the Faculties.|$|E
25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E

25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - {{wanted to see}} him, and his run was extended and extended, as was the seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to avoid {{answering}} questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if {{she was still in}} contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a [...] "firm, frosty" [...] 'No' to both of the questions. Vibe magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime [...] "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 that when [...] "R. Kelly comes up, she doesn't <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> his name, and nobody's allowed to ask about it at all". Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.|$|E
500|$|After {{their long}} {{national}} tour, the Music Machine {{returned to the}} studio to record their debut album, (Turn On) The Music Machine. Much to the disapproval of Bonniwell, his original material had to compete with dispensable cover versions of [...] "Cherry, Cherry", [...] "Taxman", [...] "See See Rider", and [...] "96 Tears", all chosen by their record label with an expectation that the well-known songs would increase record sales. One interpretation voluntarily selected by the band was a slow, moody, fuzz-laden arrangement of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] which bears a strong resemblance to Jimi Hendrix's later version. Bonniwell first heard the folk standard in 1962 at a club in Hermosa Beach, and was convinced the tune's tempo was too fast, as he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Wayfarers to record a slower version. He revisited the concept with altered lyrics after hearing Tim Rose's regionally successful rendition in early 1966. The throaty vocals, most evidently on [...] "Hey Joe", Bonniwell blames on recording [...] "the Turn On album after a 30-day tour. [...] Mark's fingers were literally bleeding. I could hardly <b>even</b> <b>speak,</b> much less sing". Despite the album's shortcomings, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to reach number 75 on the Billboard 200. On January 21, 1967, a song taken from the album, [...] "The People in Me", was issued as the group's second single but stalled at number 66 nationally after the band's management angered radio executives for initially making the song exclusively available to a rival station.|$|E

According to Stern, Imus would not <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> to or address Stern when he first started working there and would behave indifferently toward Stern and his crew (among {{the rest of the}} staff). Imus was then said to be apologetic after Stern's ratings began to soar and tried to restructure his show into a similar format.

As a result he was banned for only six months. He repeatedly refused to tour India fearing arrest and refused to <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> to Indian Police over the matter. However, Gibbs was named in the South African squad to tour India in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, and as a result, he had to meet with Indian Police over his involvement in the match-fixing scandal.|$|E

[...] Potential ALP officers must be Afghan nationals aged between 19 and 45, demonstrate patriotism and be fit and healthy. [...] Monthly salaries are between 6,000 and 8,250 afghanis per month. [...] The US government funds ALP salaries, weapons, ammunition and training through the Afghan Security Forces Fund that provides the finance direct to the Ministry of Interior.

2500|$|By 1966, sectarian {{violence}} in Rathcoole (along {{with the rest}} of Belfast) had considerably worsened, and the minority Catholic population there found itself under siege; Sands and his sisters were forced to run a gauntlet of bottle- and rock-throwing Protestant youths on the way to school every morning, and the formerly integrated Rathcoole youth football club banned Catholic members and renamed itself [...] "The Kai", which stood for [...] "Kill All Irish". Despite always having had Protestant friends, Sands suddenly found that none of them would <b>even</b> <b>speak</b> to him, and he quickly learned to associate only with Catholics. He left school in 1969 at age 15, and enrolled in Newtownabbey Technical College, beginning an apprenticeship as a coach builder at Alexander's Coach Works in 1970. He worked there for less than a year, enduring constant harassment from his Protestant co-workers, which according to several co-workers he ignored completely, as he wished to learn a meaningful trade. He was eventually confronted after leaving his shift in January 1971 by a number of his coworkers wearing the armbands of the local Ulster loyalist tartan gang. He was held at gunpoint and told that Alexander's was off-limits to [...] "Fenian scum" [...] and to never come back if he valued his life. This event, by Sands's admission, proved to be the point at which he decided that militancy was the only solution.|$|E
