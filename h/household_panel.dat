40|$|We compare two {{widely used}} <b>household</b> {{scanning}} <b>panels</b> {{maintained by the}} Nielsen Company and Information Resources Inc. to {{a random sample of}} the U. S. population. Results indicate that the demographic characteristics of the random sample more closely match the Census Bureau data than the <b>household</b> scanning <b>panels.</b> We also show that after controlling for demographic differences, participants in the <b>household</b> scanning <b>panels</b> are slightly more price sensitive than participants in the random sample. The two <b>household</b> scanning <b>panels</b> yield similar results in relation to one another, which suggests that the <b>household</b> scanning <b>panels</b> may suffer from sample selection and participation biases.

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{cross sectional}} weights in <b>household</b> <b>panels</b> is challenging because household compositions change over time. Sampling probabilities of new household entrants {{are generally not}} known and assigning them zero weight is not satisfying. Two common approaches to cross sectional weighting address this issue: (1) "shared weights" and (2) modeling or estimating unobserved sampling probabilities based on person-level characteristics. We survey how several well-known national <b>household</b> <b>panels</b> address cross sectional weights for different groups of respondents (including immigrants and births) and in different situations (including household mergers and splits). We show that for certain estimated sampling probabilities the modeling approach gives the same weights as fair shares, {{the most common of}} the shared weights approaches. Rather than abandoning the shared weights approach when orphan respondents (respondents in households without sampling weights) exist, we propose a hybrid approach; estimating sampling weights of newly orphan respondents only.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how <b>household</b> <b>panels</b> {{in general}} - and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) {{in particular -}} can serve as reference data for researchers collecting datasets that do not represent the full universe {{of the population of}} interest (e. g., through clinical trials, intervention studies, laboratory and behavioural experiments, and cohort studies). We first discuss potential benefits of using questions similar to those in the SOEP for studies where researchers are interested in using the SOEP as reference data. We present a comprehensive list of SOEP core questions that we recommend researchers to consider when collecting their own data. We focus on seven topics: (1) demographic and parental characteristics; (2) labour market; (3) health; (4) personality, preferences, and subjective orientations; (5) subjective wellbeing; (6) political involvement and participation, and finally, a set of core questions for young children before they enter school. Of course the selection of a minimum set of questions depends on the research question. In this paper, we offer general advice for the selection of variables to researchers interested in comparing their own data with the SOEP. clinical trials, intervention studies, behavioural experiments, cohort studies, <b>household</b> <b>panels,</b> SOEP, reference data...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which the poor benefit from economic growth remain a topic of debate in development literature. We address this issue {{in the context of}} rural Bangladesh, using a pooled dataset of three <b>household</b> <b>panels</b> between 1991 - 2001. Expansion of irrigation, paved roads, electricity, and access to formal and informal credit have (through different veins) led to higher rural farm and non-farm incomes, accounting for exogenous local agroclimatic endowments that explain {{a large part of the}} variation in the growth of infrastructure and credit programmes. However, this has not translated into substantial reductions in poverty for the poorest households. ...|$|R

The little known phenomenon of natural refreshments, which adds to entries through refreshments induced by data collectors, allows disentangling attrition bias from measurement errors connected to differences in participation experience (i. e. panel conditioning). A demonstrative application on subjective data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) serves as an example and offers insights on health-related attrition...|$|R

However, in countries with the highest individual incomes (USA, Canada, EU, Japan), few changes in individual meat consumption have occurred since 1990. In the EU, global meat consumption is increasing more and more slightly, with a move from beef and lamb to poultry. Nevertheless, the global level of meat consumption, the relative share of beef, lamb, pork and poultry, and trends are still different in various EU countries.

The analysis finds that the deprivation indices proposed are consistently and negatively correlated with income satisfaction as reported by respondents, that income weighted measures fit better than population weighted measures, and that this fit improves with countries that experienced deep institutional changes such as the transitional economies of Eastern Europe.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of the psychographic and socio-demographic factors influencing the purchase behaviour for organic food. Based on purchase data from <b>household</b> <b>panels</b> a causal model was developed and tested using the structural equation modelling method with SSI LISREL. The analysis revealed new insights about consumer behaviour regarding organic food. While the influence of the classical consumer segmentation criteria ‘income’ and ‘education’ was proven to be not significant, the purchase behaviour was primarily determined by selfish buying motives. Consumers buy organic products because they taste better, contain fewer residues and are considered to be healthier. In opposite, the influence of altruistic buying motives regarding environmental friendly behaviour was not significant. Up to now the organic market has not yet reached customers with positive attitudes towards fast food and snacks. ...|$|R

In this paper, we apply Bayesian procedures as a numerical {{tool for the}} estimation of a female labor supply model based on a sample size which is typical for common <b>household</b> <b>panels.</b> We provide two important results for the practitioner: First, for a specification with a multivariate normal distribution for the unobserved heterogeneity, the Bayesian MCMC estimator yields almost identical results as a classical Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) estimator. Second, we show that when imposing distributional assumptions which are consistent with economic theory, e. g. log-normally distributed consumption preferences, the Bayesian method performs well and provides reasonable estimates, while the MSL estimator does not converge. These results indicate that Bayesian procedures can be a beneficial tool for the estimation of dynamic discrete choice models...|$|R

However the differences lie {{not only in the}} overall homeownership rates but also in its structure, and this is the focus of this paper. Its aim is to study the impact of microeconomic factors on household’s tenure choice, using a cross-country comparative approach. Logit models are constructed for each country using data for year 2000 from the Consortium of <b>Household</b> <b>Panels</b> for European Socio-Economic Research micro-database. The models show that marriage is a significant determinant of the decision to move to homeownership in all analysed countries, while co- habitating households are more likely to rent, except for Denmark. Nationality, income and age proved to be significant explanatory variables in several countries, while staying insignificant in others. tenure choice, homeownership, housing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{maternal}} education on child's health and health behavior. We draw on a rich German panel data set containing information about three generations. This allows instrumenting maternal education {{by the number of}} her siblings while conditioning on grandparental characteristics. The instrumental variables approach has not yet been used in the intergenerational context and works for the sample sizes of common <b>household</b> <b>panels.</b> We find substantial effects on health behavior for adolescent daughters, but neither for adolescent sons nor for the health status of newborns. We show that possible concerns for the validity of the instrument are unlikely to compromise these results. We discuss mother's health behavior, assortative mating, household income, and child schooling track as possible channels of the estimated effects. Maternal education seems to affect daughter's smoking behavior through the higher likelihood of the daughter pursuing a higher secondary schooling track.
