5|$|Sarah was {{a hairdresser}} in Tottenham {{when she died}} in 2015. Before she met Amin, she was living with a boyfriend, Jesse Gitta; he {{vanished}} {{and it is not}} clear <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> beheaded, or detained after fleeing to Kenya.|$|E
6000|$|... "God's Justice!--I {{should like}} to meet the impudent Aragonese noble that would dare to hint as much as this! If Don Fernando is noble, are you not nobler, Señora, as coming of the senior branch of the same house; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> young, are you not equally so; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> wise, are you not wiser; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> comely, are you not more of an angel than a woman; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> valiant, are you not virtuous; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> graceful, are you not grace itself; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> generous, are you not good, and what is more, are you not the very soul of generosity; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> strict of duty in matters of our holy religion, are you not an angel?" ...|$|R

60|$|He {{spoke with}} a passive sort of acquiescence,--as {{if it did not}} much matter, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> not able, and no one would {{particularly}} rejoice, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sunday worship {{services}} were {{organized by the}} camp director <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a pastor, by a visiting pastor, or by the CPS men themselves.

5|$|After {{his term}} began in 2001, Cheney was {{occasionally}} asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{interested in the}} Republican nomination for the 2008 elections. However, he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term {{and he did not}} run in the 2008 presidential primaries. The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain.|$|E

5|$|At the time, World War II {{had broken}} out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had fallen to Nazi Germany. Australia had {{declared}} war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment {{until the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Townshend {{had fallen into}} depression, {{wondering}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer a visionary. He was again at odds with Daltrey and Entwistle, who merely wanted to tour and play hits and thought Townshend had saved his best songs for his solo album, Empty Glass (1980). Jones' drumming style {{was very different from}} Moon's and this drew criticism within the band. Townshend briefly became addicted to heroin before cleaning up early in 1982 after treatment with Meg Patterson.|$|E
5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team. Within {{a couple years}} Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very {{effective}} defensive pairing. Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he was confident {{in the knowledge that}} Bouchard was backing him up <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to lose the puck.|$|E
50|$|An attacking player <b>is</b> offside <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{in front}} of the ball: <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{in front of}} a ball which <b>is</b> then kicked, <b>he</b> can <b>be</b> put onside if the kicker {{subsequently}} moves ahead of him before the ball <b>is</b> caught. <b>If</b> not, <b>he</b> must stand 10m away from the player who catches the ball (as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> the acting half-back at a play-the-ball) or be penalised.|$|R

5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too.

He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 2014 Rudd {{was charged}} with {{attempting}} to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home. The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day, but the other charges remained. AC/DC released a statement clarifying that the tour promoting Rock or Bust would continue, but did not say whether or not Rudd would participate, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still {{a member of the}} band.|$|E
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
50|$|Punishment depends of minor’s age. As aforesaid, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> under 7 or 8, he can’t {{have any}} punishment. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> between 8 and 13, the {{sentence}} {{will be nothing}} more than an educational punishment. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> over 13, <b>he</b> can have an educational and a criminal punishment, but the tribunal has to explain its decision according to the minor personality and offence circumstances.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the back of the seat, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grewgious {{said all}} this, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> reading it aloud; or, still more, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> repeating a lesson. So expressionless of any {{approach}} to spontaneity were {{his face and}} manner.|$|R
5|$|She met Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in 1949, {{they married}} in December 1950; subsequently, they had five {{children}} together. In 1952, on his father's death, Chamorro's husband inherited the newspaper La Prensa. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for {{the content of the}} paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro's life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him. Chamorro's earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was assassinated on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.|$|E

5|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was manually operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> away from his home and surgery. The manual exchange served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Mail took on Beach Thomas as {{a writer}} of {{material}} relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need {{to live in a}} rural environment <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{started the}} 2003 season 4–4, but lost their final eight games. With two games {{remaining}} in the season, Jim Fassel requested a meeting with team management, and asked, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be fired, that they do so now rather than wait {{until the end of}} the season. Management complied with his request, formally firing Fassel on (or around) December 17, 2003, but allowing him to coach the team's final two games.|$|E
