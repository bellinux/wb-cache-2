Generally, many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stable equilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods.|$|E
25|$|A {{bimetallic}} strip {{is used to}} convert a temperature change into mechanical displacement. The strip consists of two strips of different metals which expand at different rates as they are heated, usually steel and copper, {{or in some cases}} steel and brass. The strips are joined together throughout their length by riveting, brazing or welding. The different expansions force the flat strip to bend one way if heated, and in the opposite direction if cooled below its <b>initial</b> <b>temperature.</b> The metal with the higher coefficient of thermal expansion is on the outer side of the curve when the strip is heated and on the inner side when cooled.|$|E
500|$|The core {{collapse}} {{phase is}} so dense and energetic that only neutrinos {{are able to}} escape. As the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons by means of electron capture, an electron neutrino is produced. In a typical Type II supernova, the newly formed neutron core has an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of about 100 billion kelvins, 104 times {{the temperature of the}} Sun's core. Much of this thermal energy must be shed for a stable neutron star to form, otherwise the neutrons would [...] "boil away". This is accomplished by a further release of neutrinos. These 'thermal' neutrinos form as neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors, and total several times the number of electron-capture neutrinos. The two neutrino production mechanisms convert the gravitational potential energy of the collapse into a ten-second neutrino burst, releasing about 1046 joules (100foe).|$|E

500|$|In lower mass cores the {{collapse}} is {{stopped and the}} newly formed neutron core has an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of about 100billion kelvin, 6000 times {{the temperature of the}} sun's core. At this temperature, neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors are efficiently formed by thermal emission. These thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron-capture neutrinos. About 1046joules, approximately 10% of the star's rest mass, is converted into a ten-second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event. [...] The suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements. [...] A process that is [...] is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 1044joules (1foe) from the neutrino pulse, producing the visible brightness, although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion.|$|E

However, precipitates of chromium, copper, or other elements can strengthen the steel by similar amounts in comparison to hardening and tempering. The strength can be tailored by adjusting the annealing process, with lower <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> resulting in higher strengths.

Lowering the temperature to [...] would increase the time for the coffee to produce such a burn to 20 seconds. Liebeck's attorneys argued that these extra seconds could provide adequate time to remove the coffee from exposed skin, thereby preventing many burns. McDonald's claimed that the reason for serving such hot coffee in its drive-through windows was that those who purchased the coffee typically were commuters who wanted to drive a distance with the coffee; the high <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> would keep the coffee hot during the trip.

6000|$|If we thus {{distinguish}} between the two sources of heat accompanying nebular condensation--the heat due to proto-chemical combinations and that due to the contraction caused by gravitation (both of them, however, being interpretable as consequent on loss of motion), it may be inferred that they take different shares during the earlier and during the later stages of aggregation. It seems probable that while the diffusion is great and the force of mutual gravitation small, the chief source of heat is combination of units of matter, simpler than any known to us, into such units of matter as those we know; while, conversely, when there has been reached close aggregation, the chief source of heat is gravitation, with consequent pressure and gradual contraction. Supposing this to be so, let us ask what may be inferred. If {{at the time when}} the nebulous spheroid from which the Solar System resulted, filled the orbit of Neptune, it had reached such a degree of density as enabled those units of matter which compose the sodium molecules to enter into combination; and if, in conformity with the analogies above indicated, the heat evolved by this proto-chemical combination was great compared with the heats evolved by the chemical combinations known to us; the implication is that the nebulous spheroid, in the course of its contraction, would {{have to get rid of}} a much larger quantity of heat than it would, did it commence at any ordinary temperature and had only to lose the heat consequent on contraction. That is to say, in estimating the past period during which solar emission of heat has been going on at a high rate, much must depend on the <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> assumed; and this may have been rendered intense by the proto-chemical changes which took place in early stages.[21] ...|$|E
