2500|$|Then Herf {{jumped in}} with similar criticisms. And then Berman. And Ibrahim. And before long, {{more or less}} {{everyone}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> There was still something, it seemed, that separated them from the neocons who hovered over the proceedings both as opponents and inspirations. Muravchik wanted to pull them somewhere most of the attendees — and organizers — were unwilling to go." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{being no}} one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at the moment, Wildcat obeyed.|$|E
60|$|The lights {{had been}} turned low, {{there was no one}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The little old gentleman with the eyeglass leaned forward.|$|E
60|$|More noticeable, however, {{than all}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> was <b>the</b> display of {{attractive}} photographs, indicating for the Sandersons {{a large and}} distinguished acquaintance of beautiful women.|$|R
60|$|No one <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> but <b>the</b> wise man's servant, {{whose name}} was Babette.|$|R
50|$|Speculation {{that someone}} <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with her {{is derived from}} the fact that her {{partially}} dressed body was found covered with a sheet.|$|R
6000|$|... "A woman ill on the bed; {{another woman}} in {{attendance}} on her, {{and no one}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Any necessity, major, for setting a guard here?" ...|$|E
60|$|She waited, troubled, {{throughout}} the evening. She {{thought he would}} avoid her, or give some sign. But he spoke to her simply and unemotionally, as he would to anyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> A certain peace, an abstraction possessed his soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh lord! So I did. I {{beg your}} pardon, old fellow." [...] There {{was no one}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at the moment, and Glossop in asking the {{question}} had in truth forgotten what he had heard of this new intimacy.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, New York based author Whitley Strieber (Walken) {{lives with}} his wife and child in Manhattan and seems to be successful. However he is woken at night by {{paranoid}} dreams that someone <b>else</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|There he paused, perceiving that Leonard paid no {{attention}} to his words, continuing quietly to replace the furniture and collect the fossils, as it no one <b>else</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> after which he carried the basket up-stairs.|$|R
30|$|Introduction. The {{patients}} need to {{know the}} name of the radiologist, and his/her professional role in their care. It is advisable to ensure that the patients are also aware of who <b>else</b> is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at <b>the</b> time of their examination, e.g. radiological trainee/nurse/radiographer, and their role(s).|$|R
60|$|He {{cleared his}} throat and took a chair by my side. Everything <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> except his face was blurred and indistinct, and his voice seemed to come to me from a long distance. But every word he uttered sank into my heart.|$|E
6000|$|There wasn't {{anything}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to divide, and we {{were just}} about to come out and call the thing settled, when I heard a shout at the door. I turned around, and there stood Harry Alden, and Scott, and Tom Myers and his brother George! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the rumble}} of cheap and vulgar talk the voices of these men appealed to the troubled girl with great charm. She felt more akin to them than to any one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{and from time to}} time she raised her eyes to their faces.|$|E
6000|$|Sherikov {{wrinkled}} his nose. [...] "A bath wouldn't {{hurt you}} any. We'll arrange that later." [...] He lit a cigar, blowing {{a cloud of}} gray smoke around him. At the door of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> two lab guards stood with guns ready. No one <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> beside Sherikov and Cole.|$|R
6000|$|The golden ripple on {{the wall}} came back again, and nothing <b>else</b> stirred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> old, old fashion! The fashion that came in with our first garments, and will last {{unchanged}} until our race has run its course, and the wide firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old, old fashion--Death! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "H'm! No one <b>else</b> {{has been}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and it hasn't been empty {{for more than}} ten minutes," [...] he remarked. [...] "Well, let's see what's inside, any way." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{opened the}} door and entered. A middle-aged man, dark and with Jewish features, was sitting writing at a desk. There was no one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> which was quite a small one. He glanced at us both {{carelessly}} enough, and leaned back in his chair.|$|E
6000|$|My {{pleasing}} {{thoughts were}} {{interrupted by the}} sudden entrance of Miss Howard. She glanced round hastily {{to make sure there}} was no one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words: ...|$|E
60|$|Paul glanced {{round the}} room. Two monks were {{standing}} with lighted tapers on the further {{side of the}} bed, {{one of whom was}} mumbling a Latin prayer. The man who had brought him here was gone. There was no one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> except the priest and himself.|$|E
60|$|She had flung {{her arms}} forward, so near that they almost touched him. He {{could have sworn}} that her lips had called his name. He felt himself bewitched, filled with an insane longing to throw out his arms in {{response}} to her passionate, unspoken invitation, <b>in</b> obedience to <b>the</b> clamoring of his seething senses. He had forgotten, even, that any one <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} the stranger entered <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{where she was}} standing by the window, looking out upon the bare branches of <b>the</b> trees <b>in</b> Bloomsbury Square. She remembered afterwards, it was just such another foggy afternoon as the afternoon of the stranger's arrival three months before. No one <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> stranger closed the door, and came towards her with that curious, quick-leaping step of his. His long coat was tightly buttoned, and in his hands he carried his old felt hat and the massive knotted stick that was almost a staff.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Volkes, the magistrate, arrived {{half an hour}} later, terribly {{shocked by}} the news he had heard. He at once set about making inquiries, and heard what the doctor and constable had to say. No one <b>else</b> had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> except <b>the</b> old cook, Mr. Carne, and the poor girl's own maid.|$|R
60|$|But {{the most}} ghastly sight {{of all was}} Cecil's face. He sat on a chair drawn up to the table, his chin fallen upon his folded arms, dark rims under his eyes, and without a single vestige of colour in his ashen face. There was no one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|With the {{exception}} of the messenger, who played the part of clerk in this civil ceremony, there was nobody <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> No greetings were interchanged, and in another moment Angela was standing, dressed in her funeral black, by George's side before the registrar, and the ceremony had begun.|$|E
6000|$|He glanced round him, {{and pointed}} to Danville, as he put the question. Before a word could be spoken by any one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> a low wailing cry of [...] "My mistress! my dear, dear mistress!" [...] {{directed}} all eyes first on the old man Dubois, then on Madame Danville.|$|E
60|$|Mr Moffat's was the {{earliest}} arrival of any importance. Frank had not hitherto made the acquaintance of his future brother-in-law, and there was, therefore, some little interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first interview. Mr Moffat was shown into the drawing-room before the ladies {{had gone up}} to dress, and it so happened that Frank was there also. As no one <b>else</b> was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> but his sister {{and two of his}} cousins, he had expected to see the lovers rush into each other's arms. But Mr Moffat restrained his ardour, and Miss Gresham seemed contented that he should do so.|$|R
60|$|Job Harpur {{was then}} called. He testified to {{entering}} the bedroom {{of the deceased}} with Dr. Arrowsmith, and to the examination he had made of it. There {{he had found the}} jewel-box opened, its contents abstracted, and the watch gone. He could find nothing <b>else</b> disarranged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> or any trace whatever that would give a clue as to the identity of the murderer. He then looked out of the window with Dr. Arrowsmith, and saw by a few leaves lying on the ground, and by marks upon the bark of the ivy, that some one had got up or down.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am not {{inclined}} {{to put up with}} anything that is very inferior," [...] said John Gordon. He could not help his eye from glancing for a moment round upon Mary Lawrie. She was aware of it, though no one <b>else</b> noticed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> She was aware of it, though any one watching her would have said that she had never looked at him.|$|R
60|$|She ran for her bonnet, and {{he kissed}} her handkerchief, which she left behind, and, I believe, {{everything}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> which bore the slightest relation to her. And then the recollection of Arundel's letter came over him, and his joy fled. When she returned, he was standing before the fire, gloomy and dull.|$|E
60|$|They {{went to a}} small inn, had supper, {{and then}} lay down on some straw in an {{outhouse}} and slept soundly until morning. Then they breakfasted, and as {{there was no one}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> Paolo was able to eat freely. Presently the landlord came in, and Hector entered into conversation with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not fair, this," [...] he cried. [...] "You do {{not know}} what you are asking. Can't you feel it, any of you others, as I do?" [...] he exclaimed, looking a little wildly around. [...] "There is {{something}} <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> something else besides you warm and living people. Be still, all of you." ...|$|E
30|$|The canines {{were allowed}} to sniff the fractioned {{starting}} scent samples (SS) and then were sent {{to search for the}} target scent (TS) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line-up (Fig.  2). The canines indicated an identified target scent (TS) by sitting or lying down. All the scent identifications were performed consistently in a double-blind routine, which means that neither the dog handler nor anyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experimental <b>room</b> had any information on the position of the target scent (TS) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line-up. Each of the scent fractions was tested by the canine three times. The positions of the scent samples (TS and DS) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lines were randomly (using dice) interchanged by another assistant.|$|R
60|$|Sue {{came out}} into the town with him, and they walked and talked with tongues centred only on the passing moments. Jude {{said he would like}} to buy her a little present of some sort, and then she confessed, with {{something}} of shame, that she was dreadfully hungry. They were kept on very short allowances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> college, and a dinner, tea, and supper all <b>in</b> one was <b>the</b> present she most desired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Jude thereupon took her to an inn and ordered whatever the house afforded, which was not much. The place, however, gave them a delightful opportunity for a tête-à-tête, nobody <b>else</b> being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and they talked freely.|$|R
5000|$|.....Beginning with [...] "Two Days Ago", when Betty tells Marc {{about writing}} {{a story about}} stillettoes, but finds it too light, saying {{that she wants to}} write {{something}} that inspires people other than writing about shoes. At a cafe, and after overhearing a couple talking, Betty and Matt talk about their future together, {{when all of a sudden}} she observes different people wearing shoes. This gives Betty an idea to do a story called [...] "Walk a Mile In Her Shoes" [...] which is about people who do inspiring things that help change the world. But Wilhelmina (who wanted Betty to write the story that she gave her) and everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meeting <b>room</b> was not cool to her idea, and gets her keys taken away.|$|R
