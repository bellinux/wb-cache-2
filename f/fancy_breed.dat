40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} origin of domesticated populations is of vital {{importance}} for understanding, preserving and exploiting breed genetic diversity. Here, {{we aim to}} assess Asian contributions to European traditional breeds and western commercial chickens for mitochondrial genetic diversity. To this end, a 365 -bp fragment of the chicken mtDNA D-loop region of 16 Dutch <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> (113 individuals) was surveyed, comprising almost the entire breed diversity of The Netherlands. We also sequenced the same fragment for 160 commercial birds representing all important commercial types from multiple commercial companies that together represent more than 50 % of the worldwide commercial value. We identified 20 different haplotypes. The haplotypes clustered into five clades. The commonest clade (E-clade) supposedly originates from the Indian subcontinent. In addition, both in commercial chicken and Dutch <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> many haplotypes were found with a clear East Asian origin. However, the erratic occurrence of many different East Asian mitochondrial clades indicates {{that there were many}} independent instances where breeders used imported exotic chickens for enhancing local breeds. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity analyses showed the influence of the introgression of East Asian chicken on genetic diversity. All populations that had haplotypes of multiple origin displayed high inferred diversity, as opposed to most populations that had only a single mitochondrial haplotype signature. Most <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> were found to have a much lower within-population diversity compared to broilers and layers, although {{this is not the case}} for mitochondrial estimates in <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> that have multiple origin haplotype...|$|R

The Padovana chicken is a historical <b>fancy</b> <b>breed</b> found in the Veneto region of Italy and produces meat that is typical to some local markets. The experiment reported here involved 60 chickens reared in an organic production system where housing was an indoor pen with access to a grass paddock. Experimental chicks were randomly selected from May 17 and 24, 2001 hatches and slaughtered at 150 and 180 days of age, respectively. Meat from 30 chickens (16 males and 14 females) from each slaughter age was stored for subsequent analysis of breast and thigh meat quality. Males were consistently heavier then females for live; without blood and feathers; eviscerated with head; neck, and legs; carcass; breast; and right thigh weight. There were no differences between males and females for chemical composition of the breast except for percentages of dry matter and ash (female> male). Generally, overall weights were greater at 180 then 150 days of age, whereas there was no difference between ages for breast chemical composition except for % protein (180 > 150). The breast and thigh had a low value of brightness and a distinctive blue meat color. The fatty acid profile of the breast consisted of a high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{new ways}} of thinking about human-bird encounters under domestication, providing the first substantive geographical study of ‘pigeon geographies’. It explores the spaces, practices, and human-pigeon relationships involved in pigeon showing and long-distance pigeon racing in Britain, from the mid-nineteenth century up until World War Two. The growth of fancy pigeon exhibitions was part of a wider Victorian passion for domesticating animals, at a time when human bodies were also subject to increasing aesthetic and moral scrutiny. Long-distance pigeon racing emerged {{at the end of this}} period, organised competitive sport more generally seen as an important means of moral improvement and identity expression. Like many other competitive pastimes in the second half of the nineteenth century, then, institutional bodies were formed to manage the expansion of showing and long-distance racing. The Pigeon Club and the Marking Conference were formed in 1885 to oversee British pigeon exhibitions, whilst the National Homing Union, formed in 1896, governed British long-distance pigeon racing. Both pastimes facilitated the formation of social worlds around varieties of domestic pigeon (Columba livia) and their respective practices. Whilst these pastimes historically had strong concentrations of male working-class followers – particularly in the north-west and north-east – they were both widespread throughout Britain and spanned all socio-economic classes, although accounts of female fanciers were rare. Through the exhibition of pigeons, fanciers debated and defined aesthetics, formulating breeding standards for each <b>fancy</b> <b>breed,</b> and questioning the ways in which pigeons were manipulated – sometimes contentiously – to produce the ‘ideal’. Long-distance pigeon racers, on the other hand, sought to understand and hone their birds’ athletic abilities, becoming entangled in scientific debate about homing, as well as geographical questions about the conduct and regulation of their sport. Racers were also drawn into aesthetic debates, exhibiting their racing birds during the off-season, the show pen becoming a fascinating frontier between showing and racing. Through the organisation of the spaces and practices that made up the fabric of these pastimes, pigeon showing and long-distance racing reconfigured both humans and their birds, the two becoming closely intertwined through collaborative encounters...|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{chickens}} are {{domestic animals}} with tremendous economic value. Due to this value, high-production lines have more important role for humans than <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> and rural populations. Production traits of these high-production lines are not comparable with traditional breeds. The preference for larger profit gradually diminishes {{the importance of}} the traditional breeds, which leads to their replacement increasing the risk of loss of their genetic variability. Despite this trend, general awareness of this problem increses providing hope in saving these rich sources of genetic variation. We selected sample of 272 individuals representing 33 traditional (<b>fancy)</b> <b>breeds.</b> I evaluated the degree of variability through the analysis of twenty selected neutral markers (mtDNA control region and 19 microsatellite loci) and four immune genes (TLR 3, TLR 4, TLR 5, TLR 7).

The results show that we can genetically differentiate breeds and identify [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Identifying {{signatures}} of selection can provide valuable insight about the genes or genomic regions that are {{or have been}} under selective pressure, {{which can lead to}} a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. A common strategy for selection signature detection is to compare samples from several populations and search for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation. Wright's fixation index, FST, is a useful index for evaluation of genetic differentiation between populations. The aim of this study was to detect selective signatures between different chicken groups based on SNP-wise FST calculation. A total of 96 individuals of three commercial layer breeds and 14 non-commercial <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> were genotyped with three different 600 K SNP-chips. After filtering a total of 1 million SNPs were available for FST calculation. Averages of FST values were calculated for overlapping windows. Comparisons of these were then conducted between commercial egg layers and non-commercial <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> as well as between white egg layers and brown egg layers. Comparing non-commercial and commercial breeds resulted in the detection of 630 selective signatures, while 656 selective signatures were detected in the comparison between the commercial egg-layer breeds. Annotation of selection signature regions revealed various genes corresponding to productions traits, for which layer breeds were selected. Among them were NCOA 1, SREBF 2 and RALGAPA 1 associated with reproductive traits, broodiness and egg production. Furthermore, several of the detected genes were associated with growth and carcass traits, including POMC, PRKAB 2, SPP 1, IGF 2, CAPN 1, TGFb 2 and IGFBP 2. Our approach demonstrates that including different populations with a specific breeding history can provide a unique opportunity for a better understanding of farm animal selection...|$|R
