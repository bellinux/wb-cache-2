500|$|... "Drowned World/Substitute for Love", {{the first}} song on the album, was written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Orbit, with additional writers including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. The singer's manager Guy Oseary had telephoned and asked Orbit for collaborating on the album. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, which included a demo version of the track. According to Madonna, {{she had been a}} fan of Orbit's work {{for a long time and}} was pleased with the demo. The song includes a sample from the song [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> the Tigers" [...] by the San Sebastian Strings, a group created by both Kerr and McKuen. The vocal sample was of a man uttering the words [...] "you see", later confirmed by him to be actor Jesse Pearson. Both McKuen and Kerr received co-writing credits on [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] due to the inclusion of the sample, and also because thematically the track follows a plotline that transpired in [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> the Tigers". Madonna was a great admirer of Collins' interior designing and had commissioned for designing a friend's night club located in Miami. He later ended up as one of the writers on the song.|$|E

It was written and produced by Madonna and William Orbit, with additional songwriters including Rod McKuen, Anita Kerr and David Collins. McKuen and Kerr received the credits due to the usage of a sample from one of their songs, [...] "Why <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> the Tigers". [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] is an ambient pop song which lyrically describes Madonna's spiritual transformation to seek authentic love over superficial alliances.|$|E

The first motif is an upward scale, illustrating the direction of Heaven, played by the first violin, imitated in fast succession by the second violin and then the continuo. The voice enters with the same motif. Towards the end, the steps are expanded to more than an octave, reaching Heaven. The bass singer and the continuo are in unison, interpreted as a mystical union of man and God.|$|E

Later in the year, following Elizabeth's illness with smallpox, the succession question became a heated issue in Parliament. They urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, {{to prevent a}} civil war upon her death. She refused to do either. In April she prorogued the Parliament, which did not reconvene until she needed its support to raise taxes in 1566. Having promised to marry previously, she told an unruly House: ...|$|E

Prince Paul, {{in the middle of}} a cabinet crisis, offered a nonaggression pact and a declaration of friendship, but Hitler insisted on his proposals. Prince Paul warned that [...] "I fear that if <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> your advice and sign the Tripartite Pact I shall no longer be here in six months." [...] On 8 March, Franz Halder, the German Chief of the Army General Staff, expressed his expectation that the Yugoslavs would sign if German troops did not cross their border.|$|E

500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Jason Bentley {{served as the}} film's music supervisor. An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than going with a traditional film composer, I wanted to try something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me to make sure that I was going to hold up to the Tron legacy".|$|E
500|$|In the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms {{that his}} {{conscience}} was captive to the Word of God, {{and it was}} neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: [...] " [...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us {{that we need to}} repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: [...] "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?" [...] Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless {{of the extent to which}} it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: [...] "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one" [...] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|Iorga's other {{contributions}} were polemical pieces, targeting various of {{his colleagues}} who opposed what he defined as a new direction in historiography (școala critică, [...] "the critical school"): Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Grigore Tocilescu, V. A. Urechia and A. D. Xenopol among them. One such piece read: [...] "With all my powers, <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> a cultural and moral ideal for my country, and whoever shall {{stand in the way}} of this, my life's most cherished goal, is my enemy, an enemy I will never spare no matter what, however unpleasant or painful this may prove, no matter what troubles I may encounter as a result." [...] His position received endorsement from another Sămănătorul contributor, literary chronicler Ilarie Chendi, who alleged that, since Romanian literature was facing [...] "spiritual decadence", the main exponents of a moral consciousness were historians of the new directions (a reference to Iorga, Ion Bogdan and Dimitrie Onciul).|$|E

When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw {{that they did not have}} enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. Lü Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, [...] "I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while <b>I</b> <b>follow</b> you to help Gan Ning.

2500|$|As a young singer Brown was {{influenced}} by older contemporaries such as Delroy Wilson (whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing), Errol Dunkley, John Holt, Ken Boothe, and Bob Andy. Brown's first recording was an original song called [...] "Lips of Wine" [...] for producer Derrick Harriott, but when this was not released, he recorded for Clement [...] "Coxsone" [...] Dodd's Studio One label, and his first session yielded the single [...] "No Man is an Island", recorded when Brown was aged twelve and released in late 1969. The single received steadily increasing airplay {{for almost a year}} before becoming a huge hit throughout Jamaica. Brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for Dodd, amounting to around thirty songs, and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists, including providing harmonies along with Horace Andy and Larry Marshall on Alton Ellis's Sunday Coming album. Brown was advised by fellow Studio One artist Ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting, and after convincing Dodd to buy him an instrument, was taught the basics by Ellis. These Studio One recordings were collected on two albums, No Man is an Island and If <b>I</b> <b>Follow</b> my Heart (the title track penned by Alton Ellis), although Brown had left Studio One before either was released. He went on to record for several producers including Lloyd Daley ("Baby Don't Do It" [...] and [...] "Things in Life"), Prince Buster ("One Day Soon" [...] and [...] "If I Had the World"), and Phil Pratt ("Black Magic Woman", [...] "Let Love In", and [...] "What About the Half"), before returning to work with Derrick Harriott, recording a string of popular singles including [...] "Silhouettes", [...] "Concentration", [...] "He Can't Spell", and [...] "Musical Heatwave", with the pick of these tracks collected on the Super Reggae and Soul Hits album in 1973. Brown also recorded for Vincent [...] "Randy" [...] Chin ("Cheater"), Dennis Alcapone ("I Was Lonely"), and Herman Chin Loy ("It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Song My Mother Used to Sing") among others, with Brown still at school at this stage of his career.|$|E
