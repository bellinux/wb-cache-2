5|$|Better Out Than In was a {{residency}} {{undertaken by}} pseudonymous graffiti artist and political activist Banksy in New York City during October 2013. Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> and satire.|$|E
5|$|Although some reviewers {{initially}} {{expressed concerns}} about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and <b>dark</b> <b>humor.</b> The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed {{as one of the}} greatest video games of all time.|$|E

50|$|He {{has also}} worked for many Mondo Media shows like Thugs on Film and The God & Devil Show. It was while working on Mondo that he met Kenn Navarro and Aubrey Ankrum, and created the popular <b>dark</b> <b>humored</b> flash cartoon series, Happy Tree Friends. Rhode worked as writer, {{director}} and art director, and also originally did the voices of Lumpy and Splendid.|$|R
50|$|Rat is an {{insensitive}} {{character in}} the strip, whose interactions with others are typically sarcastic, condescending, self-centered, insulting and often violent. In particular, he will frequently berate his creator on general quality of the strip. Often self-employed, most of his businesses involve either punishing or defrauding people for their ignorance, much {{in the same vein}} as Dogbert, though with a <b>darker</b> <b>humor.</b> His political views are right-wing, especially in foreign policy.|$|R
25|$|The {{game was}} {{received}} moderately well by critics with aggregate {{scores in the}} 70% range for both platforms at GameRankings, a video game aggregate website. Critics generally felt the game was unique and that it featured impressive artificial intelligence. They also praised the game's <b>dark</b> <b>humor,</b> most notably for the different ways the swarmites can die. Some critics expressed frustration at the game's difficulty level. As of June 2011 the Xbox 360 version had reached 13,000 in sales, while the PlayStation 3 version showed numbers nearing 2,000 during the game's first month.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the {{brothers}} {{wrote and directed}} Blood Simple, their first commercial film together. Set in Texas, the film tells {{the tale of a}} shifty, sleazy bar owner who hires a private detective to kill his wife and her lover. The film contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case noir and horror), plot twists layered over a simple story, <b>dark</b> <b>humor,</b> and mise en scene. The film starred Frances McDormand, who would go on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel). Upon release the film received much praise and won awards for Joel's direction at both the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards.|$|E
25|$|On one level, {{the show}} is a {{conventional}} family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, {{the show is}} distinguished by its unblinking focus {{on the topic of}} death, which it explores on multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each episode begins with a death – the cause of which ranges from heart attack or murder to sudden infant death syndrome – and that death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes {{in a way that is}} illuminated by the death and its aftermath. The show also utilises <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> and surrealism running throughout.|$|E

50|$|After his {{observations}} of the unexplained impact of angels glow, Dinwiddie’s erroneous conclusion was that mortification (now called gangrene or necrosis) was caused by “dark humors” or “bad air” (miasma theory) that had contacted his surgical instruments, clothing and bedding, and moreover, these <b>dark</b> <b>humors</b> could be eradicated by heat and noise. Based on his flawed idea Dr. Dinwiddie began a daily practice of placing his surgical bedding and instruments into {{a large pot of}} boiling pine tea. When the steam (in his mind the ‘dark humors’ or 'bad air') came to the surface, he would ring a cow bell to frighten them away. Dr. Dinwiddies’ infection rates plummeted.|$|R
50|$|Gibson’s works {{specialize}} in the {{close examination of}} various American sub-cultures, from gun collectors to whaleship crewmen to freak show performers, usually as seen {{through the eyes of}} a single strongly delineated character. His approach combines unflinching realism with <b>dark,</b> dry <b>humor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ladislas Starewitch died on 26 February 1965, {{while working}} on Comme chien et chat (Like Dog and Cat). He {{was one of the}} few European animators to be known by name in the United States before the 1960s, largely on account of La Voix du rossignol and Fétiche Mascotte (The Tale of the Fox was not widely {{distributed}} in the US). His Russian films were known for their <b>dark</b> <b>humor.</b> He kept every puppet he made, so stars in one film tended to turn up as supporting characters in later works (the frogs from The Frogs Who Wanted a King are the oldest of these). For example, in Fétiche mascotte (1933) we can see puppets from The Scarecrow, The Little Parade, and The Magical Clock. The films are united, incredible imagination and development of techniques, like motion blur, replacement animation, multiple frame exposing, and reverse shooting.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, with reviewers mentioning its <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> and noir-inspired motif as high points. It received {{criticism for}} its controls {{and lack of}} combat depth. [...] In 2008, it won the Writers Guild of America's first-ever award for video game writing.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} forms of <b>humor.</b> Irreverent, <b>dark,</b> and black <b>humor</b> have been used {{throughout}} history for social commentary. Irony, parody, sarcasm, and satire can break through preconceived notions, barriers and the tensions we experience when confronted with uncomfortable issues such as bigotry, elitism, and genetic superiority. Humor {{provides an opportunity for}} a release of tension giving way to a more receptive audience and a more effective message. My thesis is an exploration of the use of irreverent, <b>dark,</b> annd black <b>humor</b> as vehicles for effective social commentary in communication design...|$|R
5000|$|Cooper's run was {{characterized}} by grisly stories spiked with <b>dark,</b> tongue-in-cheek <b>humor,</b> a sort of radio Grand Guignol. A character might be buried, eaten, or skinned alive, vaporized in a ladle of white-hot steel, absorbed by a giant slurping amoeba, have his arm torn off by a robot, or forced to endure torture, beating or decapitation—always with the appropriate blood-curdling acting and sound effects.|$|R

It was recorded in March 1988 at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio with producer Jack Endino. [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] was released as Mudhoney's debut single by independent record label Sub Pop on August 1, 1988. The song's lyrics, which feature <b>dark</b> <b>humor,</b> are a sarcastic take {{on issues such as}} disease and violent sex.|$|E
500|$|Stanley Kubrick ( [...] ; July 26, 1928– March 7, 1999) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor, and photographer.

His films, which are mostly adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres, and are noted for their realism, <b>dark</b> <b>humor,</b> unique cinematography, extensive set designs, and evocative use of music.|$|E
500|$|While Half-Life 2 follows protagonist Gordon Freeman in a dystopian future, Concerned {{follows a}} similar {{path through the}} eyes of [...] "Gordon Frohman", a dangerously clumsy {{character}} who arrives in the setting of the game a few weeks before Freeman does. The webcomic's <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> is derived from its contrasts with the game and through references to the game's shortcomings. On several occasions in the comic, Frohman becomes the cause of various disastrous circumstances that Freeman will later encounter.|$|E

The trio are frequently thrown into bizarre misadventures, often involving the paranormal/supernatural. The series is known for its <b>dark,</b> surreal <b>humor</b> and atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|So Hutch's solo debut isn't groundbreaking, {{but even}} so, the MC is clever and {{entertaining}} {{enough to hold}} your attention. <b>Dark,</b> twisted <b>humor</b> was always one of Hutch's strong points, and there's no shortage of it on Executive Decisions -- much like Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, this CD is amusing and disturbing at the same time. And musically, Executive Decisions is easy to admire.|$|R
500|$|After Bateman {{signed on}} to direct the film, he and Dodge {{spent a long time}} {{revising}} the script, particularly adjusting parts where the <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> [...] "went a little bit too far". In the original script, the story was intended to take place at the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C. The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in Los Angeles since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film.|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} Room Full of Mirrors, biographer Charles R. Cross comments that the song's theme is [...] "as {{old as the}} blues itself; the singer's woman doesn't love him any more and has moved". Author Kay Norton describes the broader blues influence as [...] "balancing a celebration of love and sex with <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> and wry commentary on loss, mistreatment, corruption, and poverty". [...] The lyrics follow a blues call and response or AAB pattern, where the first line (A) is repeated (often with a slight variation), followed by the response (B): ...|$|E
500|$|Much of the comic's <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> {{is derived}} from its {{contrasts}} with Half-Life 2: in a depressing, dark vision of a conquered humanity's future, Gordon Freeman becomes a hero and savior; the similarly named Gordon Frohman, on the other hand, is just an average person, improbably cheerful {{to the point of}} stupidity, and somewhat naïve as to what is actually going on around him. [...] For instance, Frohman fails to realize that his return-addressed letters to Doctor Breen reveal his location, and so result in that location being invaded, bombed, or otherwise compromised.|$|E
5000|$|Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (1999) is a {{collection}} of 23 short stories by American David Foster Wallace. Several of the stories are entitled [...] "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men" [...] and are presented as transcripts of interviews with male subjects. The interviewer's questions are omitted from the transcripts, rendered merely as [...] "Q." [...] These stories {{and the rest of the}} collection are characterized by <b>dark</b> dry <b>humor,</b> alienation, and unconventional sexuality.|$|R
50|$|Nicholson {{made a major}} career shift with Through the Habitrails, {{in which}} “There is a {{frightening}} internal logic to Nicholson’s stories that {{is the hallmark of}} the best of horror. This series of surreal, <b>dark</b> <b>humored</b> short stories about life in the corporate world of commercial illustration was first published in four volumes of Stephen R. Bissette’s Taboo (comics) anthology (alongside Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell’s From Hell series), and elevated Nicholson from a relatively cult-like status to receiving more substantial coverage in the comics journalism and mainstream media of the time. His comics were also published by various larger or more mainstream publishers from 1992-1997, including Hyena magazine (Tundra Publishing), Negative Burn (Caliber Comics), The Big Book of Little Criminals, The Big Book of Losers (DC Comics / Paradox Press), The Dreaming (Vertigo (DC Comics)., and Father & Son, a four issue series published by Kitchen Sink Press,depicting “the misadventures of a slacker Gen-Xer and his type-A boomer dad… nominated for two Eisner Awards (the Oscars of comics, as people in the industry like to call them)… depicting the ironies of mundane everyday life".|$|R

500|$|... "The Mansion Family" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed reception from critics. Susan Dunne of The Hartford Courant {{described it as}} [...] "debauched but hilarious." [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on [...] "The Mansion Family", writing that [...] "Although The Simpsons started out as moderately reality based, pretty much any grounding was gone by [...] That doesn’t mean the show fails to depict funny bits, especially during the <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> of Burns’ hospital visit. Nonetheless, [...] occasionally goes {{too far to the}} side of silliness; those gags are hit or miss." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by {{executive}} producer Tom Fontana, and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal. In response to network feedback and poor ratings from the , [...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked several changes in the series, including a less bleak visual style and a greater focus on one plot, rather than multiple subplots. It {{was also the first}} episode to focus primarily on a homicide victim, rather than on the detectives. Simon felt the dialogue was realistic, especially that of the <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> employed by detectives as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the job.|$|E
500|$|Hans Zimmer {{worked on}} Witch Hunters as an {{executive}} music producer. Icelandic composer Atli Örvarsson (co-author of Zimmer's score for [...] ) created the film score. Örvarsson had previously scored Season of the Witch so initially he was [...] "a bit apprehensive" [...] to work on another witchcraft film but was [...] "too fond of the story to say no and found Tommy Wirkola's take on the subject matter to be very refreshing." [...] Örvarsson {{found it easier to}} collaborate with Wirkola due to their shared Nordic heritage and said that their discussions about the music for the film [...] "might have had some of the most cold and <b>dark</b> <b>humor</b> of any Hollywood music meetings." ...|$|E
50|$|I Am So Proud Of You is a 2008 {{animated}} {{short film}} by Don Hertzfeldt. It {{is the second}} chapter of a trilogy about the character Bill and continues the <b>dark</b> and philosophical <b>humor</b> of the first film, Everything Will Be OK.|$|R

The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures {{in and around}} the titular Colorado town. Much like The Simpsons, South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and <b>dark,</b> surreal <b>humor</b> that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.|$|R
