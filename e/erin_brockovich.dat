5|$|Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} {{who works with}} Clark Kent at the Daily Planet, and former lover of Superman. Spacey recommended Singer to cast Bosworth in the role because she co-starred with Spacey in Beyond the Sea (2004) as Sandra Dee. Claire Danes and Keri Russell were reportedly considered for the role. Amy Adams, who would later be cast as Lois Lane in the 2013 reboot Man of Steel, confirmed {{in an interview that}} she had also auditioned for Lois in 2005. Adams had previously auditioned for Lois in 2003 when Brett Ratner was planning to direct Superman: Flyby. Bosworth studied Katharine Hepburn's acting for inspiration, particularly in The Philadelphia Story (1940) and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), as well as Julia Roberts in <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> (2000).|$|E

5|$|Although {{previous}} {{attempts to}} create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Richard Sakai and Mike Scully began development of the film, and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this rewriting continued after the animation had begun in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich,</b> Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Kelsey Grammer and Edward Norton. Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves.|$|E
5|$|The film premiered on March 17, 2000, in 2,587 theaters {{across the}} United States and Canada, earning $10,015,822 on its opening weekend, {{with an average}} of $3,871 per theater. Final Destination placed at No. 3 in the United States box office on its opening weekend, behind {{biography}} film <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> and the science fiction film Mission to Mars. The film remained at No. 3 during the second weekend, before dropping to No. 7 on its third weekend. Final Destination continuously dropped across subsequent weekends until it fell from the top-10 list on its eighth weekend. The film lasted in theaters for 22 weekends, its last screening airing in 105 theaters and grossing $52,675, placing at No. 56. Final Destination grossed $53,331,147 in the United States and Canada on its total screening, and earned $59,549,147 in other territories, earning an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally.. The film is frequently considered a sleeper hit.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} eleven {{years of the}} Academy Awards, {{directors}} were allowed to be nominated for multiple films {{in the same year}}. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, Angels with Dirty Faces and Four Daughters, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony. That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> and Traffic in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that have been awarded Best Picture, 63 have also been awarded Best Director. Since its inception, the award has been given to 69 directors or directing teams. John Ford has received the most awards in this category with four. William Wyler was nominated on twelve occasions, more than any other individual. As of the 2017 ceremony, Damien Chazelle is the most recent winner in this category for his work on La La Land. Chazelle also became the youngest director in history to receive this award, at the age of 32. Two directing teams have shared the award; Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for West Side Story in 1961 and Joel and Ethan Coen for No Country for Old Men in 2007. The Coen brothers are the only siblings to have won the award. Kathryn Bigelow is the only woman to have won the award, for 2009's The Hurt Locker.|$|E

25|$|Coppola was {{the third}} {{director}} to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year. Victor Fleming {{was the first in}} 1939 with Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz; Alfred Hitchcock repeated the feat the next year with Foreign Correspondent and Rebecca. Since Coppola, two other directors have done the same: Herbert Ross in 1977 with The Goodbye Girl and The Turning Point, and Steven Soderbergh in 2000 with <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> and Traffic.

25|$|UCLA has {{attracted}} filming for decades with {{its proximity to}} Hollywood. Much of the film Gotcha! (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.|$|E
500|$|Eckhart gained wide {{recognition}} as George in Steven Soderbergh's critically acclaimed film <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> (2000), and in 2006 received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor for {{his portrayal of}} Nick Naylor in Thank You for Smoking. Another mainstream breakout occurred in 2008 when he starred in the blockbuster Batman film The Dark Knight as District Attorney Harvey Dent.

500|$|... "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] {{was written}} by Carolyn Omine and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Ron Taylor. [...] Omine conceived the episode after hearing about smokers who sued tobacco companies. While its plot is loosely based on <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich,</b> the episode also features references to Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Butterfinger. It also features Ben Stiller as Garth Motherloving. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.5million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh had [...] "conceptual discussions" [...] with Gaghan {{while he}} was {{shooting}} The Limey in October 1998, and they finished the outline before {{he went off to}} shoot <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich.</b> After Soderbergh was finished with that film, Gaghan had written a first draft in six weeks that was 165 pages long. After the film was approved for production, Soderbergh and Gaghan met two separate times for three days to reformat the script. The draft they shot with had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities. The film shortens the storyline of the original mini-series; a major character arc, that of a farmer, is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{named it}} a 'Critics Pick' of 2009. Andrew O'Hehir of Salon praised {{the film and}} called its {{production}} a sign [...] "of hope in the impenetrable impasse of the contemporary Middle East". Benjamin Secher of The Daily Telegraph labeled it [...] "absorbing, sensitive, beautifully-shot" [...] and drew favorable comparisons with <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich.</b> Mark Jenkins of National Public Radio stated that it featured [...] "subtle performances by its striking stars" [...] {{and served as a}} parable about border issues. AMC's Chris Cabin criticized the movie, arguing that its director [...] "seems not to have the faintest idea of how to properly approach the subject", because the film is, in Cabin's view, [...] "unabashedly pro-Palestine".|$|E
500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich.</b> The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich,</b> Eckhart co-starred with Renée Zellweger in LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000). He next {{appeared}} in Sean Penn's mystery feature The Pledge (2001), in which he played a young detective partnered with a veteran detective, played by Jack Nicholson. The movie received generally favorable reviews, {{but it did not}} fare particularly well at the box office. The following year, he collaborated with LaBute in a film adaptation of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel Possession (2002). In 2003, Eckhart co-starred with Hilary Swank in The Core, a film about a geophysicist who tries to detonate a nuclear device in order to save the world from destruction. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Also in 2003, he appeared in The Missing, in which he played Cate Blanchett's lover, and in the action-thriller Paycheck opposite Ben Affleck. Paycheck, based on a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, garnered generally negative reception. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars (out of four), saying that he [...] "enjoyed the movie" [...] but felt that it [...] "exploits [...] for its action and plot potential, but never really develops it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Eckhart {{moved to}} Australia {{and settled in}} Sydney, where he {{attended}} American International School of Sydney for his high school senior year; he further developed his acting skills in productions like Waiting for Godot, where {{he admits that he}} gave a [...] "terrible" [...] performance. In the autumn of his senior year, Eckhart left school to take a job at the Warringah Mall movie theater. He eventually earned his diploma through an adult education course. This also allowed Eckhart time to enjoy a year of surfing in Hawaii and France, as well as skiing in the Alps. In 1988, Eckhart returned to the United States and enrolled as a film major at Brigham Young University–Hawaii, but later transferred to Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. His fortunes changed for the better when he was offered the role of George in the film <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich,</b> which gave his failing career a much needed boost. He was then flooded with film offers and before long established himself as a respected character actor in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{had written}} the opening concert scene without a {{specific}} band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides {{the voice of the}} father in the [...] "new Grand Canyon" [...] commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich</b> also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star.|$|E
500|$|Aki's {{appearance}} was received positively by critics, with {{praise for the}} finer details of the character model such as the rendering of her hair. Entertainment Weekly named Aki an [...] "it girl", stating that [...] "Calling this action heroine a cartoon would be like calling a Rembrandt a doodle." [...] She was voted one of the sexiest women of 2001 by Maxim and its readers, ranking at No. 87 out of 100, becoming the first fictional woman to ever make the list, additionally appearing on the issue's cover in a purple bikini. The same image appeared in the [...] "Babes: The Girls of Sci Fi" [...] special issue of SFX. Ruth La Ferla from The New York Times described her as having the [...] "sinewy efficiency" [...] of Alien franchise character Ellen Ripley and visual appeal of Julia Roberts' portrayal of <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich.</b> The book Digital Shock: Confronting the New Reality by Herve Fischer described her as a virtual actress having a [...] "beauty that is 'really' impressive", comparing her to video game character Lara Croft. In contrast, Livia Monnet criticized her character {{as an example of}} the constantly kidnapped female in Japanese cinema, further [...] "diluted" [...] by her existence solely as a computer-generated character representing [...] "an ideal, cinematic female character that has no real referent." [...] Writing in the book Action and Adventure Cinema, Marc O'Day described her as among the [...] "least overtly eroticised" [...] female characters in science fiction, though stated that Aki was [...] "transformed in a variety of poses into an erotic fantasy machine" [...] in a photo shoot that was included on the DVD's special features.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweets and Sour Marge"'s plot is {{loosely based}} on the 2000 drama film <b>Erin</b> <b>Brockovich,</b> which {{revolves}} around Erin Brockovich's legal fight against the US West Coast energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The Duff Book of World Records is a parody of the annually published reference book Guinness Book of World Records. Cereal mascot Count Fudgula is a spoof of the General Mills cereal mascot Count Chocula (who, in turn, parodies fictional character Count Dracula). After sugar becomes banned in Springfield, the town's police force can be seen burning confiscated sugar products. However, when they throw an amount of Butterfinger candy bars in the fire, the bars start to glow and are left intact. Disappointed, police chief Clancy Wiggum explains [...] "Butterfingers. Even fire doesn't want them." [...] For a long time, The Simpsons characters starred in Butterfinger commercials, which helped the series get launched by earning revenue from the commercials. Around the time [...] "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] was written, the series contract with Butterfinger was terminated, and the staff therefore decided {{to make fun of}} it. [...] "If it had still been in existence, we wouldn't have done it", Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty is {{loosely based on}} Darlene Cates' character Bonnie Grape in the 1993 film What's Eating Gilbert Grape. Before he agrees to hand the sugar cargo to Motherloving, Homer demands that he gets to see an Oompa Loompa, a character from the 1964 children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Oompa Loompa's design is based on the version used in the 1971 film adaptation Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, which Kirkland watched in order to [...] "get [...] right." ...|$|E
