50|$|Degeneration of {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) {{is the main}} cause of neck and low back pain. The IVD is composed of a gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP) centre and several surrounding coaxial lamellae that form the inner and outer anulus fibrosus. This unique structural feature allows the IVD to constrain motion at high loads and provide flexibility at low loads. While factors such as abnormal mechanical stresses, biochemical imbalances and nutritional and genetic deficiencies are all reported {{to play a role in}} disc degeneration, the natural aging process is also characterised by replacement of the gelatinous nucleus pulposus region of the disc by a less-flexible cartilaginous disc. Current treatments (usually massage, mediations; or acupuncture, manipulation) typically provide short-term relief though invasive surgery can be used as a last resort. NFB strategy is to develop an injectable, <b>functionalised</b> hydrogel loaded with hollow extracellular matrix-based spheres that will restore the mechanical properties of the disc and deliver genes to upregulate extracellular matrix components such as aggrecan that are limited in the diseased state. The spheres will be <b>functionalised</b> using PEG-based hyper-branched polymers, designed and developed in-house, that will enable delivery of specific bioactive molecules and will be delivered by injection directly into the intervertebral column.

40|$|The {{challenge}} in synthesising lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (NPs) is the shielding of lanthanide luminescence from the quenching ions around the NPs.

Nearly 14 -fold enhancements in luminescence intensity were observed as the oleic acid surface grafting coefficient increased from 0 to 5. 7. This increase in luminescence intensity is attributed to the shielding of the NP surfaces from surrounding quenching ions such as OH-, by the fatty acid molecules. In view of the changing ligand length, different fatty acids (decanoic acid, hexanoic acid, oleic acid, octanoic acid, and tetradecanoic acid) were used to <b>functionalise</b> the NPs.

50|$|Recently, new {{reagents}} {{have been}} developed that allow for the specific measurement of endo-cellulase. These methods involve the use of <b>functionalised</b> oligosaccharide substrates {{in the presence of}} an ancillary enzyme. In the example shown, a cellulase enzyme is able to recognise the trisaccharide fragment of cellulose and cleave this unit. The ancillary enzyme present in the reagent mixture (β-glucosidase) then acts to hydrolyse the fragment containing the chromophore or fluorophore. The assay is terminated by the addition of a basic solution that stops the enzymatic reaction and deprotonates the liberated phenolic compound to produce the phenolate species. The cellulase activity of a given sample is directly proportional to the quantity of phenolate liberated which can be measured using a spectrophotometer. The acetal functionalisation on the non-reducing end of the trisaccharide substrate prevents the action of the ancillary β-glucosidase on the parent substrate.|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} step {{to control the}} stability of inorganic nanoparticles lies in their surface modification and functionalisation [30, 31]. Here, we compare three strategies to <b>functionalise</b> nearly monodispersed silver-based nanoparticles directly in aqueous solution. We have synthesised silver nanoparticles with a narrow shape and size distribution (15 nm quasi-spherical nanoparticles), <b>functionalising</b> them with polyethylene glycol (PEG) [32 – 34], gold (core-shell) and chromium (alloy). We have characterised the different silver-based nanostructures and established their stability by UV-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid. We have tested the validity of our results using statistical bootstrapping tools, demonstrating a close relationship between homogeneity of nanoparticle size, shape and particle sphericity. Finally, this study {{has made it possible}} to produce stable silver-based nanoparticles {{that can be used for}} further applications and studies of toxicity and environmental impact, where the effect of the nanoparticle-containing solution can be attributed to nanoparticles of a controlled size and stability and not to by-products of synthesis (free ions, toxic surfactants), aggregation and/or degradation due to aging effects.|$|R
