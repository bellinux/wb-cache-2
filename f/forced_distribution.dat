40|$|Due to the {{existence}} of surface roughness in real surfaces, the adhesion force between particles and the surface where the particles are deposited exhibits certain statistical distributions. Despite the importance of adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> in a variety of applications, the current understanding of modeling adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> is still limited. In this work, an adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> model based on integrating the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness distribution (i. e., the variation of RMS roughness on the surface in terms of location) into recently proposed mean adhesion force models was proposed. The integration was accomplished by statistical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. A series of centrifuge experiments were conducted to measure the adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> between polystyrene particles (146. 1 ± 1. 99 μm) and various substrates (stainless steel, aluminum and plastic, respectively). The proposed model was validated against the measured adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> from this work and another previous study. Based on the proposed model, the effect of RMS roughness distribution on the adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> of particles on a rough surface was explored, showing that both the median and standard deviation of adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> could be affected by the RMS roughness distribution. The proposed model could predict both van der Waals force and capillary <b>force</b> <b>distributions</b> and consider the multiscale roughness feature, greatly extending the current capability of adhesion <b>force</b> <b>distribution</b> prediction...|$|R

However, the use of Indian labor was hampered by the dramatic decline in the Indigenous population that occurred especially in the 16th century and the restrictions imposed by the colonial authorities that privileged the use of Indian labor for the mining sector.Given the difficulties faced by the indigenous labor employment, farmers resorted to buying African slaves.These slaves performed a variety of jobs, working as wheeler-dealers, prenseros, bakers, tinkers, ashtrays and artisans. Also carried out field work, livestock and shepherds, or were serving as cocheres, carretoneros and carriers. Women slaves, meanwhile, performed jobs like cooking, child care and provide them the catechism. The purchase of slaves used to represent a very strong monetary investment for the landowner and it was common for the highest value of the sugar mills represent what precisely their slaves and machinery and land.Slavery in the estates was not exempt from abuse and cruelty. They lived in miserable huts and could not ever leave the Iímites of the hacienda. To ensure the survival of the slaves, they were often marked as the cattle, with a hot iron on his face. Their living conditions were so deplorable that many victims died of disease, while some chose suicide to end their suffering. And it was common to avoid having children, to spare these penalties to which they would be subjected.Among the slaves of the sugar mills, the situation calls attention guarding who played the position of Master of sugar, since that work experience required.

40|$|In this study, the {{perceptions}} of 42 teachers—from the Stann Creek District, Belize—regarding the implementation and use of Intercultural Bilingual Education (IBE) as a language preservation tool in their schools were examined. Intercultural Bilingual Education (IBE) is a teaching method that aims at promoting the preservation of indigenous languages by integrating an indigenous language and culture into the academic curriculum, such that students can develop a better appreciation of their history and traditional practices. To examine the perspectives of teachers regarding IBE, Q Methodology {{was used to examine}} the research question: What is the range of perspectives teachers hold regarding IBE as a language preservation tool? From participant interviews and responses to an open-ended prompt centered on the research questions, the researcher developed a 40 -item Q sample comprising statements that represented distinct perspectives on the use of IBE as a language preservation tool. Forty-two participants then sorted these 40 statements within a <b>forced</b> <b>distribution</b> grid that ranged from “most like my perspective” (+ 4) to “least like my perspective” (- 4). These 42 Q sorts were then correlated; the correlations were then analyzed and rotated using PQ method software. Four factors were extracted from this process and they were converted to factor arrays resembling the same initial <b>forced</b> <b>distribution</b> grid. Based on an interpretation of the holistic configuration of these factor arrays and descriptive comments from participants concerning their sorts, these factors were named as: Strongly Supported IBE (Factor 1), Strongly Opposed but Conflicted about IBE (Factor 2), Cautiously Optimistic about IBE (Factor 3), and Supported IBE for Intergenerational Language Transfer (Factor 4). Implications from this study for administrators of similar programs include the importance of understanding teacher beliefs regarding their preparedness to deliver an IBE curriculum as well as their perceptions regarding the usefulness of such an approach, particularly given the additional instructional time needed to deliver it...|$|E

Greater improvement is associated with a higher percentage of firing. The effects of different selection procedures (external hiring, internal promotion or a combination of these two procedures) added to a FDRS are also investigated.

These sectors were amongst the first to utilize technology in a way which had transformative implications for work processes and people management in white-collar service work. In both sectors and across clerical and engineering work contexts, the data show the use of EPM by managers to guide punitive performance management for sickness absence and perceived reduced capability. Older workers emerge as a vulnerable group, with manager decisions shown to be based on age stereotypes.
