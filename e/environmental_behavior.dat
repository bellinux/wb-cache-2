In the pres-ent study, we explored primitive belief underlying environmental attitudes, i. e., connections with nature, and its relationship with pro-environmental behaviors. Specifically, we used scales, a computerized Implicit Association Test, and a situational simulation experiment to examine both explicit and implicit connections with nature, both deliberate and spontaneous <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and to find correlations between environmental connectedness and <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Results showed that explicit connectedness {{was positively correlated with}} deliberate <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors,</b> while implicit connectedness was positively correlated with spontaneous <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Additionally, explicit and implicit connectedness was independent of each other.

40|$|Abstract. Simulatability has {{established}} {{itself as a}} salient notion for defining and proving the security of cryptographic protocols since it entails strong security and compositionality guarantees, which are achieved by universally quantifying over all <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the analyzed protocol. As a consequence, however, protocols that are secure except for certain <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> are not simulatable, even if these behaviors are efficiently identifiable and thus can be prevented by the surrounding protocol. We propose a relaxation of simulatability by conditioning the permitted <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors,</b> i. e., simulation is only required for <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> that fulfill explicitly stated constraints. This yields a more fine-grained security definition that is achievable for several protocols for which unconditional simulatability is too strict a notion, or at lower cost for the underlying cryptographic primitives. Although imposing restrictions on the environment destroys unconditional composability in general, we show that the composition of a large class of conditionally simulatable protocols yields protocols that are again simulatable under suitable conditions. This even holds for the case of cyclic assume-guarantee conditions where protocols only guarantee suitable behavior if they themselves are offered certain guarantees. Furthermore, composing several commonly investigated protocol classes with conditionally simulatable subprotocols yields protocols that are again simulatable in the standard, unconditional sense. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Research {{has shown}} that {{personal}} health behaviors and actions established early in life are often carried through adulthood. Thus, working with children to increase environmental health literacy may improve the environmental health literacy of future adults, potentially improving {{the health of the}} Nation. Given the amount of time children spend in school, this setting could be an ideal place to address environmental health with children. According to social cognitive theory, observation is one way in which learning takes place. Consequently, the <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> and attitudes modeled by teachers would likely impact the <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> and attitudes learned by students. A research study including 101 pre-service teachers from a large Midwestern university was conducted to determine participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and <b>behaviors</b> regarding <b>environmental</b> health.

Specifically, childhood participation in “wild ” nature such as hiking or playing in the woods, camping, and hunting or fishing, as well as participation with “domesticated ” nature such as picking flowers or produce, planting trees or seeds, and caring for plants in childhood have a positive relationship to adult environmental attitudes. “Wild nature ” participation is also positively associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors</b> while “domesticated nature ” experiences are marginally related to <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Few organoiodine {{compounds}} {{are important}} industrially, {{at least in}} terms of large scale production. Iodide-containing intermediates are common in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C - I bond. Industrially significant organoiodine compounds, often used as disinfectants or pesticides, are iodoform (CHI3), methylene iodide (CH2I2), and methyl iodide (CH3I). [...] Although methyl iodide is not an industrially important product, it is an important intermediate, being a transiently generated intermediate in the industrial production of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. The potential for methyl iodide to replace the ubiquitous dependence on methyl bromide as a soil fumigant has been considered, however limited information is available on <b>environmental</b> <b>behavior</b> of the former. [...] Ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), which inhibits photosynthesis at photosystem II, is among the very few organoiodine herbicides.

50|$|In {{attempt to}} save the alalā, efforts {{have been made to}} breed the species in captivity. A {{majority}} of these efforts have proved to be highly unsuccessful. Studies have shown that females are the primary nest builders, and if the male hangs around the nest for too long and attempts to sit in it, the female either ceases her efforts to complete the nest or in other cases, builds up aggression between the breeding pair. This disruptive behavior can inhibit the production of eggs. On average, clutch size bred in captivity is much lower than it has been observed in the wild. This can be attributed to thin eggshells as a result from inbreeding, and behavioral complications from males. Bred in isolation, some males exhibit aggressive behavior towards their mates and an inability to understand friendly gestures. For the best breeding success, it is important for cages to mimic real <b>environmental</b> <b>behavior,</b> and socially-reared males are put together with the females.|$|E
