DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER Abstract: The paper aims at substantiating {{the first}} steps of a more <b>general</b> <b>undertaking</b> {{regarding}} self-awareness in agent-based systems, founded on Hofstadter’s ideas and presented in previous papers (illustrating the broad-band technology potential from an anthropocentric and transdisciplinary perspective). This second paper focuses on computer science aspects, keeping a definite engineering perspective: the target is a generic architecture – based on Gödelian self-reference – for agent-based applications meant for open, heterogeneous, dynamic and uncertain environments. Specific objectives are: a) to defend the undertaking from an agentoriented software engineering point of view; b) to detail the rationale for starting by Gödelian self-reference; c) to specify a stepwise approach affordable within a narrow scope; d) to present self-cloning as the basic software mechanism able to uphold this approach; e) to outline very roughly an experimental model. (Details and implementation issues regarding mechanisms and models are described in forthcoming papers.) Preliminary conclusion: the approach seems workable and the applicative potential seems significant...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the methodologies and results recorded in a documentary/field study concerning work related stress {{and its effects}} on work productivity. The project had as its main aim the elaboration of an instrumental pattern for the assessment of stress influence on work productivity, based on the investigation of the work stress as well as the diagnosis of its occurrence in the companies of the Romanian economic environment. The methods involved: the provision of a scientific theoretical and methodological base, which could catch and include as many aspects of stress as possible and especially their correlation to the indicators of work productivity (e. g. review various policies and actions aiming at reducing the effects of stress at the work place recommended by institutions with duties in the area; strategies adopted by international companies and European ones); elaboration of a set of hypotheses and investigation criteria of the stress at work and assessment of its effects on the modification of indicators on work productivity; the elaboration of the investigation methodology (hypothesis to approach the inquiry at national level: definition of the investigation area, the variables/indicators necessary to draw up the questionnaires). Work stress was tackled as a component of the present stress phenomenon inside the society and, at organizational level, as cumulus of the individual stress reactions as responses to the job and extra-job stress factors. The findings represented the base from which the elaboration of the assessment system of stress influence on work productivity in the companies of the Romanian economic environment started, as an operational instrument for employers to integrate occupational stress management in the <b>general</b> <b>undertaking</b> to prevent occupational risks with obvious benefits both on workers’ health and performance and also on company's health and proficiency...|$|E
40|$|The Act on Freedom of Economic Activity of 2 July 2004 regulates {{two types}} of issues: the {{starting}} up, running and liquidating a company in Poland and the tasks of the organs of public administration in that respect. The scope of the said Act clearly continues the concepts expressed in the Act on Economic Activity and adds to it provisions regulating the tasks of the public administration. The legislator resigned from the earlier model which regulated the tasks and competences of an organ of public administration, which, consequently, has not been included in a separate chapter in the Act. At {{the same time a}} catalogue of general principles regulating individual organs of public administration realising their statutory economic tasks was introduced. One of them is a <b>general</b> <b>undertaking</b> to support entrepreneurship, the objective of which is the creation of favourable conditions to start up and run a business. The paper constitutes an analysis of the provisions of the Act on Freedom of Economic Activity and other related acts {{from the point of view}} of realisation of the provisions of article 8 clause 1 of the said Act by organs of public administration operating within the limits of their statutory tasks. The main task here, from the public law point of view, is determination of the mutual relationship between those acts, and an attempt to systematise public tasks in that regard. The analysis conducted for the sake of the paper allows one to state that indeed there occurs a relation between the discussed act and its government-related provisions. Among the tasks before the organs of public administration and provisions of substantive law there are those which realise the general norms, or provisions, of the analysed act. However, the manner in which they are formulated indicates that both the tasks performed by organs o f public administration as well as the manner in which they are delivered require far-reaching co-ordination. Although the legislator seems to have been right to use the general norms to indicate the rules of proceeding for the organs of public administration in economy, the legal regulations relating to their realisation still fail to ensure their proper execution...|$|E

Returns were also received from some specialist referral centres (one elective orthopaedic hospital, one maternity hospital neonatology radiology service, two university paediatric hospitals and one breast screening service); the data from these centres have been included, but are less applicable to general conclusions because of the very specific nature of the services provided in these centres.|$|R
