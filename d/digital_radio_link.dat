Although scaled ships are basis for experimental studies, {{it is not possible}} to keep using them in towing tanks. The main reason is that high speeds require large space for experiments, so towing tanks are not large enough. This has been noticed after the first part of our research, with head seas, in a 150 m x 30 m towing tank with wavemaker. Consequently, we are preparing for open air experiments. A new fast autonomous scaled ship has been developed. She is self-propelled, and is self-governed by an embedded PC on-board. The ship carries sensors for heading, speed and seakeeping control.

40|$|Regarding {{the high}} {{performance}} and reconfigurability of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), many recent {{software defined radio}} (SDR) systems are currently being designed and developed on them. On the other hand, {{a wide variety of}} applications in communication systems benefits from Phase-Shift Keying (PSK) modulation. Therefore, with respect to practical constraints and limitations, design and implementation of a robust and efficient FPGA-based structure for PSK modulation is an attractive subject of study. In practice, there is an unavoidable oscillator frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver which poses many challenges for designers. This frequency offset makes carrier recovery and time synchronization as two essential functions of every receiver. The possible solution lies in the closed loop control techniques. In other words, without feedback-based controllers, acceptable performance in a <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> is unachievable. The Costas Loop {{is one of the most}} effective methods for carrier recovery and its advantage over other methods is that the error signal in the feedback loop is twice as accurate. The Gardner time synchronization method is also introduced as a closed loop clock and data recovery technique and, regarding to its performance, is a potential candidate to be implemented on FPGA-based platforms. The main body of this thesis work is related to the realization aspects of these methods on FPGA. The thesis spans from the design and implementation of a baseband digital transceiver to connecting it to a radio frequency device, forming a Binary/Quadrature PSK modem. The introduced platform is developed on National Instruments Universal Software Radio Peripheral (NI USRP) equipped with a Xilinx Kintex 7 FPGA. Many case studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of similar systems considering Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this study, in addition to SNR, the effectiveness of the implemented transceiver has been evaluated based on its ability to deal with the carrier and symbol rate frequency offsets. The introduced platform shows promising results in its capability to resolve up to ± 200 kHz carrier frequency offset and ± 14 kHz symbol rate frequency offset (in 18 dB SNR). Furthermore, on the basis of the performed assessment, it is concluded that the introduced model is robust and potential to be applied in array-based or multi-channel networks...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the effects of non-linear propagation on a proposed <b>digital</b> microwave <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> which employs MSK modulation, in order to specify a suitable form of adaptive equalization. MSK is a coherent modulation technique, having improved spectral roll-off over FSK because it avoids the abrupt phase changes at the bit transitions. However computer simulations and field results indicate that MSK <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>links</b> do suffer from intersymbol interference and crosstalk. Software and hardware simulations of multipath propagation are based on Rummlers simplified three path model and statistics. The results obtained from the computer simulations of the MSK link and multipath propagation confirm {{that there is no}} simple relationship between the multipath parameters and the BER degradation which could be used in the design of an equalizer. The choice of adaptive equalizer is made based on criteria such as construction cost, circuit complexity, and performance improvement. It is known from ray model analysis that at a transmitting frequency of 23 GHz deep fading will only occur on links longer than 5. 24 kms. However even on hops of length 5 km' s the fade time is-in the order of 1612 seconds/month (calculated using Rummlers model). A ldB increase in theoretical Eb/No will also be required to overcome potential modem imperfections. It is necessary to have a time domain equalizer which can compensate for both amplitude and phase distortions simultaneously by acting directly on the ISI.
