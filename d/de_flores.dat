25|$|The ex Hacienda of El Molino <b>de</b> <b>Flores,</b> now the Molino <b>de</b> <b>Flores</b> Nezahualcóyotl National Park, {{is located}} three km {{east of the}} city and used to produce pulque and grains. Most of the {{buildings}} on the site, such as the main house, the church of San Joaquin and the Chapel of Señor de la Presa (Lord of the Dam), were constructed by Miguel de Cervantes and his wife. According to tradition, the chapel was named for an apparition of Christ which supposedly occurred on the rocks that border the Cuxcahuaco which crosses this property. The chapel is built out of the rockface, much like the temple at Malinalco. The hacienda reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th century. After the Mexican Revolution, it was abandoned and it deteriorated. The hacienda was declared a national park by President Lázaro Cárdenas in 1937. Due to its style and condition, the hacienda {{has been used as a}} set for Mexican and foreign films.|$|E

50|$|The Prix <b>de</b> <b>Flore</b> is a French {{literary}} prize founded in 1994 by Frédéric Beigbeder. The {{aim of the}} prize is to reward youthful authors and is judged {{by a panel of}} journalists. It is awarded yearly in November, at the Café <b>de</b> <b>Flore</b> in Paris. The prize only applies to French-language literature, even though the author {{does not have to be}} French. Bruce Benderson was the first non-French author to receive the prize, in 2004, for the novel Autobiographie érotique (released in English as The Romanian: Story of an Obsession).The laureate of the Prix <b>de</b> <b>Flore</b> wins about 6,000 Euros and is entitled to drink a glass of Pouilly-Fumé, a white wine from the Loire region of France, at the Café <b>de</b> <b>Flore</b> every day for a year.

25|$|After the {{independence}} from Spain in 1816, {{the city and}} province of Buenos Aires {{became the focus of}} an intermittent Argentine Civil War with other provinces. A Federal Pact secured by Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas in 1831 led to the establishment of the Argentine Confederation and to his gaining the sum of public power, which provided a tenuous unity. Ongoing disputes regarding the influence of Buenos Aires, between Federalists and Unitarians, and over the Port of Buenos Aires (the prime source of public revenue at the time) fueled periodic hostilities. The province was declared independent on September 11, 1852, as the State of Buenos Aires. Concessions gained in the 1859 Pact of San José <b>de</b> <b>Flores</b> and a victory at the Battle of Pavón led to its reincorporation into the Argentine Republic on December 17, 1861. Intermittent conflicts with the nation did not truly cease until 1880, when the city of Buenos Aires was formally federalized and, thus, administratively separated from the province.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Leopoldo Torres Ríos gave Bence {{her first}} {{starring}} role in film in Adiós Buenos Aires, where she played a showgirl [...] "Luisita" [...] living a bohemian life. In November 1938, she {{attracted the attention of}} the public and press when she starred in the play Mujeres at the Smart Theatre, (currently Multiteatro) located on Avenida Corrientes. The play was written by American writer and actress Clare Boothe Luce and also starred Mecha Ortiz. In one of the scenes, Bence appeared bathing in a tub full of foam. She said: [...] "I wore nylon mesh, it was very modest but, as was logical, it did not go unnoticed. I had a very big impact {{as a result of that}} scene... so much so that, the Teatro Maipo... made a parody of it". [...] The work was described as [...] "original, fresh, and modern", reaching 250 performances. It was revived at the Teatro Fénix <b>de</b> <b>Flores.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Alongside the chivalric, French {{literary}} {{tastes of}} the period were drawn to the amorous and pathetic, especially as depicted in the novels of Spaniards Diego de San Pedro and Juan <b>de</b> <b>Flores,</b> themselves inspired by Boccaccio's Lady Fiammeta and its psychologically insightful portrayal of a woman spurned. [...] This sentimental vein would find admirable expression in parts of Hélisenne de Crenne’s Les Angoisses douloureuses qui procèdent d’amours which blends sentimental and chivalric elements, humanist scholarship, orality and eloquence.|$|E

2500|$|The cathedral was {{originally}} {{built on the}} site of a 16th-century Franciscan monastery. [...] Later, it was rebuilt in 1664 as the Parish of San Antonio de Padua. The complex also housed the first European-style school for natives in Mesoamerica, and the Latin alphabet can be seen on some of its columns. Fragments of the portal, the Latin cross layout of the temple and the open chapel are all that is left of the original 16th century monastery. [...] The feast day of the Anthony of Padua, the city’s patron saint is celebrated on 13 June. Another festival if the Molino <b>de</b> <b>Flores</b> (Flower Windmill) which takes place on Pentecost.

[...] His {{attachment to the}} Iberian Peninsula is demonstrated in Canção Ibéria of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of Enrique Granados' piano Goyescas (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece Desesperança— Sonata Phantastica e Capricciosa no. 1 (1915), a violin sonata including [...] "histrionic and violently contrasting emotions", the birds of L'oiseau blessé d'une flèche (1913), the mother–child relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos's music) in Les mères of 1914, and the flowers of Suíte floral for piano of 191618 which reappeared in Distribuição <b>de</b> <b>flores</b> for flute and guitar of 1937.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the first}} {{religious}} missionaries assigned to Leyte in 1580 were the priests {{belonging to the}} Order of Saint Augustine, the Society of Jesus continued the Christianization efforts of their predecessors in 1595. Padre Antonio Sedeño, the Vice-Provincial of the Jesuit mission in the Philippines, had his eye on setting the islands of Leyte and Samar as a mission field. Invited by the citizens of Zebu for the founding of a central house there, Padre Sedeño chose four priests, Pedro Chirino, Antonio Pereira, Juan del Campo, and Cosme <b>de</b> <b>Flores,</b> and one lay brother, Gaspar Garay to open the mission of Leyte with the appointment of Padre Chirino as superior of the expedition. The missionaries landed {{in the town of}} Carigara on the morning of July 16, 1595, the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. They introduced themselves to the encomendero of Carigara, Cristobal de Trujillo, and presided an assembly for the construction of the mission residence there. While the rest of the Jesuits studied Waray-Waray and orienting the natives to the Faith, Padre Chirino and Padre Pereira pushes towards the eastern coast, in Dulac, for the founding of a residencia [...] facing the Pacific Ocean. Within a span of two years, the Sons of Saint Ignatius of Loyola founded five permanent mission stations: Carigara (July 1595), Dulag (September 1595), Palo (October 1596), Alangalang (May or June 1595) and Ogmoc (1597).|$|E
