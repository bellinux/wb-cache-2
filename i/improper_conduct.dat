5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, on 18 July 2008, Evra was charged with four {{separate}} counts of <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> by the FA. The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007–08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm-down following a match on 26 April. The defender denied the charges and was supported by several members of the club's staff, who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation. Evra remained free to play for United up to the date of the hearing despite the charges being made in July 2008. He began the campaign in similar fashion to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team's 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties. Evra was ever-present in Manchester United's first 22 competitive matches of the season, starting 19 of them. At the hearing on 5 December, Evra was found guilty of <b>improper</b> <b>conduct,</b> and handed a four-match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, Wenger {{was charged}} with <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> by UEFA, over {{comments}} made to referee Massimo Busacca, after his team's defeat to Barcelona. He was fined €10,000 and suspended for one UEFA club competition match; however, the ban was later extended to a further two games, after Wenger {{was found guilty of}} communicating with Arsenal's bench while serving a touchline ban against Udinese. A year later, Wenger was charged for post-match comments made about referee Damir Skomina, in Arsenal's defeat to Milan in the Champions League. He was fined £33,000 and handed a three-match touchline ban in the competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match tempers boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for <b>improper</b> <b>conduct.</b> Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger {{in favour of}} Ray Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various sanctions against the national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling fans at Euro 2004. UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for similar incidents in the past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for trespassing. There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> by Croatia fans at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry {{escalated}} in September 2003, when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. In {{the match}} Vieira was shown a second yellow card {{for his part}} in an altercation with striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, and during stoppage time, defender Martin Keown brought down Diego Forlán in the Arsenal penalty area. United were awarded a penalty and Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take it, but his shot rebounded off the crossbar. This was followed by scenes of jubilation from the Arsenal players, who confronted Van Nistelrooy after his miss and the resulting scuffle led to another fracas after the final whistle. The FA immediately took action, charging six of Arsenal's players (Jens Lehmann, Ray Parlour, Lauren, Cole, Keown and Vieira) with <b>improper</b> <b>conduct.</b> The club was fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA at the time.

5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, {{the attorney general of the}} Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of <b>improper</b> <b>conduct.</b> The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited as an example of a repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
5|$|After Diocletian's {{reform of}} the provinces, {{governors}} were called iudex, or judge. The governor became responsible for his decisions first to his immediate superiors, {{as well as to}} the more distant office of the emperor. It was most likely at this time that judicial records became verbatim accounts of what was said in trial, making it easier to determine bias or <b>improper</b> <b>conduct</b> on the part of the governor. With these records and the Empire's universal right of appeal, Imperial authorities probably had a great deal of power to enforce behavior standards for their judges. In spite of Diocletian's attempts at reform, the provincial restructuring was far from clear, especially when citizens appealed the decisions of their governors. Proconsuls, for example, were often both judges of first instance and appeal, and the governors of some provinces took appellant cases from their neighbors. It soon became impossible to avoid taking some cases to the emperor for arbitration and judgment. Diocletian's reign marks the end of the classical period of Roman law. Where Diocletian's system of rescripts shows an adherence to classical tradition, Constantine's law is full of Greek and eastern influences.|$|E

40|$|Foods can been {{contaminated}} by S. aureus usually {{as a result}} of unhygienic behaviour of staff or <b>improper</b> <b>conducted</b> technological procedures. Compared to saprophytic bacteria, S. aureus does not possess significant competitive properties; however its epidemiological potential consists in multiplication to density higher than 10 6 cfu/g and formation of heat-resistant enterotoxins by which it causes food poisoning. Based on the data in 2001, the risk was characterized as follows : S. aureus is almost ubiquitous in ewes’ milk. It is likely that it can increase its numbers by more than 3 log cfu/g and exceed the densities from 10 5 - 10 6 cfu/g for a short period, particularly at farm conditions. It is unlikely that it can succeed in competition with active lactic acid bacteria when they are present in higher numbers in ewes’ milk. While exposure of S. aureus through consumption of lump ewes’ cheese made  ​​ from raw milk is high, its consequences are mild and severity may be assessed as negligible. The overall risk is considered as low. A kind of confirmation provides the official incidence of staphylococcal poisoning which is 0. 2 per 100, 000 populations (lower than the EU<...|$|R
