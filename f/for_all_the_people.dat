25|$|The themes {{expressed}} in gold or ceramics {{show that the}} various communities in these areas were politically and religiously related. The designs on textiles and clay baskets, the female clay figurines, {{and the construction of}} the burial mounds were similar <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of these river valleys. Like the channel system, which remained in use for many centuries, these cultural features lasted a long time and are part of what is called the Zenú tradition. Artisans from different localities in the area, however, expressed these ideas in their own way, making it possible to distinguish between them. Nevertheless, they showed a common Zenú identity.|$|E
25|$|The series' main {{theme is}} {{responsibility}} {{as seen through}} Kenshin's action as he wants to atone <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he killed during the Bakumatsu by aiding innocent people by wielding a non-lethal sword. Marco Olivier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolizes Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors appearing in the series. This theme also encourages former drug dealer Takani Megumi into becoming a doctor upon learning of Kenshin's past and actions. Another theme is power which is mostly seen by Sagara Sanosuke and Myojin Yahiko. However, like Megumi, these two characters are also influenced by the main character as they wish to become stronger in order to assist Kenshin across the plot. Additionally, the series discourages revenge {{as seen in the}} final arc when Yukishiro Enishi believes he succeeded in getting his revenge on Kenshin but starts having hallucinations of his late sister with a sad expression on her face.|$|E

25|$|One {{exception}} {{was a military}} force of Poles from the Polish Legions that had fought in Napoleon's army. A majority of Polish soldiers refused {{to fight against the}} Black inhabitants. At the time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland, as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their homeland. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the French army and join the Haitian slaves, and participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, supporting the principles of liberty <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Władysław Franciszek Jabłonowski who was half-Black was one of the Polish generals at the time. Polish soldiers had a remarkable input in helping the Haitians in the retaliation fights against the French oppressor. They were spared the fate of other Europeans. For their loyalty and support for overthrowing the French, the Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its Independence, and many of them settled there to never return to Poland. It is estimated that around 500 of the 5280 Poles chose this option. Of the remainder, 700 returned to France to eventually return to Poland, and some – after capitulation – were forced to serve in British units. 160 Poles were later given permission to leave Haiti and some particular ones were sent to France at Haitian expense. To this day, many Polish Haitians still live in Haiti and are of mixed racial origin, however some have blonde hair, light eyes, and other European features. Today, descendants of those Poles who stayed are living in Cazale, Fond-des-Blancs, La Vallée-de-Jacmel, La Baleine, Port-Salut and Saint-Jean-du-Sud.|$|E

500|$|Another {{method of}} {{peaceful}} protesting was {{demonstrated in the}} formation of Camp Solidarity which was located {{in the center of the}} protesting, in southern Virginia. Supporters came from all over the country to show their outrage against the actions of Pittston but there was no place that they could stay. Although many people in the local towns would offer shelter, they could not provide enough beds and food <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who came. Union member supporters found a solution to the problem. [...] A local recreational park near Castlewood, Virginia was turned into a campground where these supporters could stay. A small shelter equipped with bunk beds was built and an already existing snack bar was opened to provide food for the people staying at Camp Solidarity. Because the location was a recreational park, there was plenty of space for others to bring campers and tents into the area.|$|E
