5|$|As weather {{conditions}} worsened, Royal Navy destroyers were {{only able to}} rescue 90 survivors from the three German ships. Before the rescue operation was suspended to engage TA 20, Wheatland {{pulled out of the}} sea three officers and 68 seamen—most of them crew of UJ 202. The Kriegsmarine sortied TA 40 and TA 45 corvettes as well as S 33 and S 154 E-boats to look for survivors, finding seventeen TA 20 crew members on the islet of Trstenik on 3 November. The group included seven wounded, tended by a local lighthouse crew. Besides them, the ships rescued one UJ 202 and three UJ 208 crew members from the sea. The deteriorating weather also prevented retrieval of the coast watchers for four days. More than two hundred Germans perished in this action, including the <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander</b> and all three ship commanding officers.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty ordered Captain Warburton-Lee {{to attack}} German {{shipping}} in Narvik, Norway on 9 April. The following morning Hardy led four of her half-sisters down Ofotfjord in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. A torpedo from Hardy blew off {{the stern of}} the German flagship, , and killed the German <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander,</b> Commodore Friedrich Bonte. Heidkamp sank the next day. Another hit a merchant ship in the stern. A second salvo of four torpedoes was fired at two other German destroyers, but missed and badly damaged the ore docks. After regrouping, Captain Warburton-Lee led another attack on the harbour later that morning, but inflicted little additional damage due to poor visibility.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July, the {{minelayer}} , {{escorted by}} the cruisers Lübeck, Roon, and Augsburg and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of Bogskär. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; Augsburg, Albatross, and three destroyers made for Rixhöft while {{the remainder of}} the unit went to Libau. Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander,</b> ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and Lübeck. Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with Prinz Heinrich and Prinz Adalbert to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert. Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser.|$|E

5000|$|Surface flotillas {{were first}} formed in 1938 from preexisting surface divisions, {{some of which}} had existed since before the First World War. The surface flotillas were {{primarily}} used for mid to smaller class vessels, such as destroyers and minesweepers, while capital ships and heavy cruisers were considered [...] "stand alone" [...] vessels answering directly to a vessel type <b>commander.</b> Surface <b>flotilla</b> <b>commanders</b> reported to a type commander for their particular class of vessel.

5000|$|Minesweeper flotillas of the Kriegsmarine were {{administrative}} units grouping German minesweepers together. There were {{three types of}} minesweeper flotillas, these being the standard minesweepers, auxiliary minesweepers, and [...] "mine barrage" [...] vessels. <b>Flotilla</b> <b>commanders</b> operated from a shore office and were usually commanded by an officer ranked as a Korvettenkapitän.

25|$|Whilst {{heading for}} this German force, the {{flotilla}} {{ran into a}} newly laid, uncharted minefield and Express was badly damaged, losing most of her bow. The explosion caused heavy casualties: ninety of the 175 men on board were killed or wounded, including her captain, J.G. Bickford, who was injured by the explosion. The <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander,</b> Lieutenant-Commander Crouch, moved his ship, Esk, to assist Express but Esk also hit a mine and the vessel swiftly sank, killing all on board, save one man. Ivanhoe then went to transfer the wounded from Express but also hit a mine and was badly damaged, the explosion killing a further 53 men and wounding {{the majority of the}} crew. Several life rafts, carrying shipwrecked sailors, drifted into the Dutch coast where those on board were detained by the German authorities as prisoners of war.|$|E

This was the first E boat captured and Hichens' crew obtained valuable information and equipment before the boat sank. For this action Hichens was awarded a Bar to his DSC, the citation noting his [...] "...oolness skill and readiness when in action against enemy E boats sinking one and damaging others".|$|E
500|$|The two central {{boats in}} the German {{flotilla}}, S117 and [...] the flotilla leader S119, tried to hit Undaunted with torpedoes but Undaunted outmanoeuvred the German boats and remained unscathed. When Legion and Loyal had finished off S118, they came to Undaunteds aid and engaged the two attackers. Legion attacked S117, which fired its last three torpedoes and continued to engage with gunfire. Legion pulverised S117, damaging her steering mechanism which forced her to circle before she was sunk at 15:30. At the same time, Lance and Lennox had damaged S115 {{to the point where}} only one of the destroyers was needed. Lance joined Loyal in bombarding S119 with lyddite shells. S119 managed to fire a torpedo at Lance and hit the destroyer amidships but the torpedo failed to detonate. S119 was sunk at 15:35 by gunfire from Lance and Loyal, taking the German <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander</b> down with it. S115 stayed afloat despite constant attacks from Lennox, which sent a boarding party, who found a wreck with only one German on board who happily surrendered. Thirty members of the crew were eventually rescued from the sea by the British vessels. The action ended at 16:30, with gunfire from Undaunted finishing off the abandoned hulk of S115.|$|E

5000|$|During {{tactical}} operations, the Navy group commanders {{served in}} the same capacity as an operational fleet commander.

He was aware that the British had attempted to set their flag there in 1859 and had conducted hydrographic surveys around the island in 1855. In 1860 he requested a go-ahead from the government in Saint Petersburg; the cautious foreign minister, Alexander Gorchakov, ruled out any incursions against British interests, while General Admiral Konstantin Nikolayevich suggested making a private deal {{with the head of}} Tsushima-Fuchū Domain, as long as it did not disturb [...] "the West".

2500|$|On 15 April 1909, Whiting took Porpoise out {{for what}} his crew of six {{thought would be}} a routine run. After Porpoise leveled off in Manila Bay {{at a depth of}} 20 feet (6.1 meters), Whiting {{informed}} his crew that he was convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through a torpedo tube and that he intended to test the idea on himself. He squeezed into Porpoises 18-inch (460-mm) tube and clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door as the crew closed the inner door. When the crew opened the outer door and seawater rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar, which drew his elbows out of the tubes mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms. After 77 seconds, he was free of the submarine and swam to the surface; Porpoise soon surfaced and recovered him. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public [...] in Porpoises log that day, Whiting simply commented, [...] "Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in water in normal condition, as an experiment..." [...] he nevertheless informed his <b>flotilla</b> <b>commander,</b> Lieutenant Guy W. S. Castle, who submitted a report on how the feat had been accomplished.|$|E

At 2045 Heinrich had ordered the second torpedo boat flotilla under captain Schuur together with three boats from the sixth flotilla (from the XII half-flotilla) under Kapitanleutnant Lahs, all positioned at the rear (north) of the German fleet, to stage an attack {{to the east of}} the German position.
