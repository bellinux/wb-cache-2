5|$|Final Fantasy IV {{introduced}} Square's Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which {{differed from}} the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player <b>inputting</b> orders for the characters in real time during battles. The system was used in many subsequent Square games.|$|E

He contributed to {{productions}} including electric guitar, jazz, and rock music. He acquired his first computer about 1998, wherein he began to learn musical composition and production. He experimented by taking compositions from Ludwig van Beethoven and Sergei Prokofiev, and <b>inputting</b> them electronically into his computer. He noted in a 2006 interview that his wife Katie O'Brien Field helped with promotion of his music.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by <b>inputting</b> certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that not all drum module <b>inputs</b> have the same capabilities. Besides the obvious differences between mono, stereo and three-way <b>inputs,</b> which support mono (single-zone), stereo (dual-zone) or three-zone pads accordingly, there are additional differences in the capabilities of stereo <b>inputs.</b> While some stereo <b>inputs</b> only support pads with a piezo and a switch (piezo/switch <b>inputs),</b> others also support pads with two piezos (piezo/piezo <b>inputs).</b> Also, some stereo <b>inputs</b> are only intended to be split into two mono <b>inputs</b> by using an insert cable (mono/mono <b>inputs).</b> Certain pairs of stereo <b>inputs</b> can be configured to form one three-way <b>input.</b>|$|R
5|$|Convicted {{computer}} {{criminals are}} people who are caught and convicted of computer crimes such as breaking into computers or computer networks. Computer crime can be broadly defined as criminal activity involving information technology infrastructure, including illegal access (unauthorized access), illegal interception (by technical means of non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within a computer system), data interference (unauthorized damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or suppression of computer data), systems interference (interfering with the functioning of a computer system by <b>inputting,</b> transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data), misuse of devices, forgery (or identity theft) and electronic fraud.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). <b>Inputting</b> the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual Gigabit Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for <b>inputting</b> audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E

Parents have access to their child(ren) current grades, report card, attendance, progress reports, transcripts, schedule, etc. The teachers have access to all of the above, and also has access to <b>inputting</b> grades, locker combination, personal information (e.g., allergies), and discipline reports. Newfound utilizes this tool to help teachers organize their grades, and allows students/parents to see their current grades without asking their teachers.|$|E
25|$|A common {{occurrence}} {{was the use}} of domain names similar to known ones, such as whitehouse.com (unrelated to whitehouse.gov), which for some period featured explicit content. The use of expired domains is also common, along with typosquatting, which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when <b>inputting</b> a website address into a web browser.|$|E
25|$|While {{there may}} be {{arguments}} in favour {{of some of these}} variant romanizations in specific contexts, their use, especially if mixed, leads to confusion when romanized Japanese words are indexed.

25|$|As well as {{its primary}} use for citing Russian names and words in {{languages}} which use a Latin alphabet, romanization is also essential for computer users to input Russian text who either {{do not have a}} keyboard or word processor set up for <b>inputting</b> Cyrillic, or else are not capable of typing rapidly using a native Russian keyboard layout (JCUKEN). In the latter case, they would type using a system of transliteration fitted for their keyboard layout, such as for English QWERTY keyboards, and then use an automated tool to convert the text into Cyrillic.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different keyboard layouts arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are <b>inputting</b> text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, computer programming, or other purposes. The United States keyboard layout is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.|$|E

Team 2 can vary their bowling strategy (between conservative and aggressive) to try and achieve either of these objectives, so this means doing the same calculations as above, <b>inputting</b> their opinions of future runs conceded, wickets taken and overs bowled in each bowling strategy, to see which one is best.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of photocells. Various types of photocells were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices.
