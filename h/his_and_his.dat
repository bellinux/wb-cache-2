The Great Powers did not support curtailing Otto's increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto's absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects.|$|E

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|At the {{concluding}} Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> descendants' {{right to the}} French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded {{the rights to the}} lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city {{in what was then}} the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.|$|E

5|$|Giovinazzi made a {{slow start}} in the first race and lost the lead to Nobuharu Matsushita. The event was {{affected}} by four safety car periods which closed the field up {{and led to the}} race being subjected to a time limit. Matsushita lost the first position to Marciello who later fended off attempts by Matsushita to reclaim the lead. Giovinazzi recovered and caught up to Marciello and passed him on the 18th lap. He stayed in the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race to clinch <b>his</b> (<b>and</b> <b>his</b> team's) first victory in the GP2 Series. In the second race, Daniël de Jong started from pole position but lost the lead to Matsushita. He then fended off a challenge by de Jong and Oliver Rowland for the position after he made a slow restart. Gasly became the leader when Marciello and Matsushita made contact and held it until Giovinazzi passed him to win the race.|$|E
5|$|In December 2000, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by a sequel, , which was broadcast on Japanese television in December 2000 and released worldwide on home video and DVD in 2001. Voiced by Dan Green in English with Ichimura reprising the role in Japanese, Mewtwo and the clones have since found peace in another region. However, Giovanni, whose memories were left intact after the first film, locates and pursues Mewtwo. Assisted by Ash and his companions, Mewtwo comes to terms with its existence and defeats Giovanni, removing any memory of itself from <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> soldiers' minds, while leaving the others unaffected. As everyone departs, Mewtwo sets out on its own.|$|E
5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged {{that while he}} was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E

5|$|In {{his fifth}} {{year with the}} Grizzlies, he became the franchise's all-time leading rebounder on March 24 against the New York Knicks when he grabbed his 3,072nd rebound in a Grizzlies uniform. He made 29 {{consecutive}} free throw attempts from January 24 to 28, tying the second best mark in Grizzlies history, including two straight games going 12–12 from the line, tying the best single-game mark in franchise history. Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to {{the playoffs for the}} third time in <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> team's history. Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of <b>his,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|One artist {{agreed to}} assist anonymously; {{he said that}} he was afraid for <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family's safety. According to Bluitgen, one artist {{declined}} due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director Theo van Gogh the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the Carsten Niebuhr Institute at the University of Copenhagen; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture. The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.|$|E

5|$|Taking an {{advantage}} of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions {{under his command}} were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster {{at the beginning of}} 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's mukhtiyari would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next mukhtiyar, {{wrote a letter to the}} King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting Mukhtiyar and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.|$|E
5|$|The February 1974 {{election}} {{proved to}} be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence {{on the grounds that the}} prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.|$|E

Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at <b>his</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him {{to break up}} with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E
5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with <b>his</b> (<b>and</b> <b>his</b> troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E
