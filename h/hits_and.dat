40|$|Background: Minimal {{improvements}} in treatment or survival {{of patients with}} osteosarcoma have been achieved {{during the last three}} decades. Especially in the case of incomplete tumor resection, prognosis remains poor. Heavy ion radiotherapy (<b>HIT)</b> <b>and</b> modern anticancer drugs like histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have shown promising effects in osteosarcoma in vitro. In this study, we tested the effect of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in a xenograft mouse model. Methods: Osteosarcoma xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection of KHOS- 24 OS cells and treated with either vehicle (DMSO), SAHA, <b>HIT</b> or <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> SAHA. Tumor growth was determined and tumor necrosis, proliferation rate, apoptotic rate as well as vessel density were evaluated. Results: Here, we show that the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> SAHA induced a significant delay of tumor growth through increased rate of apoptosis, increased expression of p 53 and p 21 Waf 1 /Cip 1, inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis compared to tumors treated with HIT only. Conclusion: <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> in particular the combination of <b>HIT</b> <b>and</b> histone deacetylase inhibition is a promising treatment strategy in OS and may be tested in clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|Persistent viral infections causing serious {{diseases}} derive, primarily, from altered {{function of}} the immune system. Knowledge of the very complex composition and {{function of the}} innate and adaptive branches {{of the immune system}} is essential to understanding persistent infection. The best {{solution to the problem of}} persistent infection is by prevention using prophylactic vaccines. <b>Hit</b> <b>and</b> run viruses evade immune destruction by infecting new hosts <b>and</b> rarely persist. <b>Hit</b> <b>and</b> stay viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine escape, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic change. Twelve prophylactic vaccines against <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> run agents exist, and there are only three vaccines against <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> stay viruses, all of which are of DNA composition. Several new vaccines against <b>hit</b> <b>and</b> stay viruses are feasible, but protective vaccines against RNA HIV and hepatitis C agents are highly unlikely, short of a major breakthrough. Therapeutic vaccines are very improbable without a magnitude of favorable new discoveries. In the meantime, antiviral chemotherapy, chemotherapy/prophylactic vaccination, and short interfering RNA silencing are worthy of intense investigation...|$|R
