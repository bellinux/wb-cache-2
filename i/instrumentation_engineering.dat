25|$|Often {{instrumentation}} is {{not used}} by itself, but instead as the sensors of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple {{might be used to}} help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engineering</b> is often viewed as the counterpart of control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Instrumentation</b> <b>engineering</b> {{deals with}} the design of devices to measure {{physical}} quantities such as pressure, flow, and temperature. The design of such instrumentation requires {{a good understanding of}} physics that often extends beyond electromagnetic theory. For example, flight instruments measure variables such as wind speed and altitude to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly, thermocouples use the Peltier-Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two points.|$|E

25|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in the year 1994 by the Parshvanath Charitable Trust, then managed by trustee Mr. Tekchand Shah. It offered instruction leading to the University of Mumbai's Bachelor of Engineering degree (4-year duration) in 3 disciplines: computer engineering, electronics and telecommunication engineering, and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>engineering.</b> The first batch of students graduated in the year 1998. New departments were subsequently started: mechanical engineering in 1996 (first batch graduating in 2000), information technology in 1999 (first batch graduating in 2003), and civil engineering in 2010 (first batch intended to graduate in 2014). All departments offered degrees of the University of Mumbai.|$|E
