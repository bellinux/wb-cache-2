40|$|Accurate forward {{modeling}} of surface subsidence above producing hydrocarbons reservoirs {{requires an understanding}} of the mechanisms determining how ground deformation and subsidence evolve. Here we focus entirely on <b>rock</b> <b>salt,</b> which overlies a large number of reservoirs worldwide, and specifically on the role of creep of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> caprocks in response to production-induced differential stresses. We start by discussing available <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> creep flow laws. We then present the subsidence evolution above an axisymmetric finite element representation of a generic reservoir that extends over a few kilometers and explore the effects of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> flow law choice on the subsidence response. We find that if <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> creep is linear, as appropriate for steady state flow by pressure solution, the subsidence response to any pressure reduction history contains two distinct components, one that leads to the subsidence bowl becoming narrower and deeper and one that leads to subsidence rebound and becomes dominant at later stages. This subsidence rebound becomes inhibited if <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> deforms purely through steady state power law creep at low stresses. We also show that an approximate representation of transient creep leads to relatively small differences in subsidence predictions. Most importantly, the results confirm that <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> flow must be modeled accurately if good subsidence predictions are required. However, in practice, large uncertainties exist in the creep behavior of <b>rock</b> <b>salt,</b> especially at low stresses. These are a consequence of the spatial variability of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> physical properties, which is practically impossible to constrain. A conclusion therefore is that modelers can only resort to calculating bounds for the subsidence evolution above producing rock salt-capped reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Whereas bulk {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) {{exhibits}} the wurtzite crystal structure, nanoscale ZnO was recently synthesized in the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> structure by addition of Mg. Using first-principles methods, we investigated two stabilization routes for accessing <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> ZnO. The first route is stabilization by Mg addition, which was investigated by considering ZnO-MgO mixed phases. The second route is through size effects, as surface energies become dominant for small nanocrystal sizes. We {{discovered that the}} surface energy of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> ZnO is surprisingly low at 0. 63 J m- 2, which is {{lower than those of}} wurtzite and zinc blende ZnO and lower than that of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> MgO.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> {{has been studied}} for many decades. Early engineering studies were driven largely {{by the need to}} design safe salt mines. In recent times more of the study is concerned to understand the long term behavior of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> to develop and assess the safety of <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> deposits for the storage of radio active waste. The physical and mechanical characteristics of salt are evidenced in its compact texture, low porosity, low permeability and strong rheological properties (creep behavior). These properties are however necessary for stability analysis and the design of engineering structures in salt mines. Long term effect of the temperature on <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> mechanical behavior has been documented by various researchers. Temperature also has pronounced effect on short term behavior like instant strength of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt.</b> Generally the trend is that as the temperature increases the instant strength decreases. For the stability of structures like solution-mined caverns, dry salt mines, storage and disposal caverns and boreholes used in the exploration and production of oil and gas comprehensive study of the instant strength of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> is also vital. The objective of this research was to study the temperature effect on the instant strength of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> obtained from Polkowice - Sieroszowice mine in the Lower Selicia. After laboratory tests using uniaxial compressive strength test method, it was observed that the at the given range of temperature applied in the test (10 degree C to 80 degree C) the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> instant strength does not show any correlation with the temperature. In other words the instant strength of the rock does not decrease as temperature increase. This kind of unanticipated behavior towards the temperature in terms of strength which is rare for the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> could be due to the reason that the range of temperature used in the test was not sufficient for the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> to show any alteration in its strength value. Since there was no significant effect of given temperature range on the strength values of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt,</b> classical failure criterion like Mohr-Coulomb criterion was considered as the suitable criterion to justify the strength changes on the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> samples. On the other hand density emerges out as a crucial factor that influences the instant strength of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt.</b> Higher uniaxial compressive strength values can be observed for the samples having higher density. This research work is useful to understand the mechanical behavior of the <b>rock</b> <b>salt</b> which behaves in a complex manner when there are lots of factors involved like geology, temperature, density, loading history, maturity of the crystals etc. are involved. It is therefore deemed necessary that more through studying and testing is required. Geo-engineeringApplied Earth SciencesCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
