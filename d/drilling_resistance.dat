30|$|Bamboo, an {{extensively}} used {{material in}} Asia, {{is becoming an}} increasingly available structural (e.g., flooring and furniture) material in Taiwan. The bending strength and dynamic modulus of elasticity of moso bamboo (Phyllosachys edulis) laminae were investigated using ultrasonic-wave and <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> techniques. The strength quality of bamboo was reduced after steaming treatment and was significantly affected by node characteristics. The transverse variations of the mean <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> value (R) gradually increased outward from the bamboo cavity layer. There were very significant positive relationships among density (ju), the <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> value (R), the dynamic modulus of elasticity (Eb), the modulus of elasticity (MOE), and the modulus of rupture (MOR), although the coefficients of determination were small. Combining ultrasonic-wave and <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> techniques is efficient in estimating and establishing the dynamic modulus of elasticity (REb). Values of REb for moso bamboo increased with increasing ju, R, Eb, MOE, and MOR, and the relationships could each be represented by positive linear regression formulas.|$|E

This paper presents a detailed investigation of user-controlled variables and their influence on <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance.</b> The study proves that the ratio of penetration rate/rotational speed (PR/RPM) is proportional to <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance.</b> Data from Bath stone and an artificial reference stone demonstrates how different materials can be compared using their intrinsic specific energy. It is also shown that adjusting drilling settings does not significantly change drilling measurement variability. However, settings producing high <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> can significantly contribute to drill bit wear. A theoretical framework in which tests can be optimised without compromising the ability to compare data is presented. The framework is of high significance to the conservation industry and will promote a more effective use of DRM.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the mass of}} coarse woody debris (CWD), {{it is necessary to}} quantify its density. <b>Drill</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements are introduced as a approach to estimate the density of CWD in different stages of decay. Dead logs of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] from a Central European mountainous site were used as a test system to compare the new method with conventional predictors of wood density such as fast quantitative field estimates (e. g., knife probe) and classification of decay classes based on a set of qualitative traits and quantitative estimates. The model containing only <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> as a predictor explained 65 % of the variation in wood density and was markedly better than models containing one or more of several conventional predictors. However, we show that the relationship between <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> and gravimetric wood density relationship is sensitive to the decay status. Therefore, the best model combines <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> and decay class (adj. R- 2 = 0. 732). An additional experiment showed that <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> is also sensitive to the moisture state (fresh vs. oven-dry) of the sample.

30|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} in situ diagnostic tools to document stone heritage sites prior to conservation interventions using a Medieval ruin of Central Europe (Székesfehérvár, Hungary). The applied methods included lithological mapping and characterisation and mapping of decay forms {{as well as in}} situ measurements of physical parameters such as Schmidt hammer rebound, moisture content and micro-drilling resistance. The combination of these methods allowed the condition assessment of different lithotypes and demonstrated the role of micro-fabric, mineralogical composition and climatic conditions in stone durability. Differences were found in the properties and in the weathering forms of fine-grained and medium-grained porous oolitic limestone and travertine. The black crust observed in porous limestone is less prone to detachment on medium-grained oolitic limestone ashlars, while scaling was observed on fine-grained oolitic limestone blocks. The micro-drilling resistance of exposed porous limestone showed higher <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> at the crust zone (upper 1 – 2 [*]mm) than below, marking the upper cemented zone, while the <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> of porous limestone under shelter showed an opposite trend.

40|$|Abstract — In this study, {{the method}} of <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> was applied to wood to {{estimate}} the Janka hardness rating and the shear strength of tropical woods. For validation of the nondestructive tests, destructive tests were performed of apparent density, shear strength and Janka hardness in the three orthotropic directions of wood- longitudinal, tangential and radial. All the destructive tests were adjusted for moisture content of 12 %. To obtain correlations between nondestructive and destructive tests, seven types of wood were used: angelim pedra (Hymenolobium petraeum), angelim vermelho (Dinizia excelsa), castanheira (Bertholletia excelsa), garapa (Apuleia leiocarpa), muiracatiara (Astronium lecointei), pequi (Caryocar villosum) and roxinho (Peltogyne discolor). The density interval was from 650 to 1150 kg/m. For estimation of Janka hardness, {{the method of}} <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> in wood exhibited good correlations, with R greater than 85 %. For shear strength, positive results were also found, however, with intermediate R values, ranging from 59 % to 75 %.

40|$|Nondestructive {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} to assess existing timber structures. The models proposed for these methods are usually performed in the laboratory using small clear wood specimens. But in real situations many anomalies, defects and biological damage are found in wood.

40|$|Background and Aims Density is {{a crucial}} {{variable}} in forest and wood science and is evaluated by a multitude of methods. Direct gravimetric methods are mostly destructive and time-consuming. Therefore, faster and semi- to non-destructive indirect methods have been developed. Methods Profiles of wood density variations with a resolution of approx. 50 µm were derived from one-dimensional resistance drillings, two-dimensional neutron scans, and three-dimensional neutron and X-ray scans. All methods were applied on Terminalia superba Engl. & Diels, an African pioneer species which sometimes exhibits a brown heart (limba noir). Key Results The use of X-ray tomography combined with a reference material permitted direct estimates of wood density. These X-ray-derived densities overestimated gravimetrically determined densities non-significantly and showed high correlation (linear regression, R 2 = 0 · 995). When comparing X-ray densities with the attenuation coefficients of neutron scans and the amplitude of <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance,</b> a significant linear relation was found with the neutron attenuation coefficient (R 2 = 0 · 986) yet a weak relation with <b>drilling</b> <b>resistance</b> (R 2 = 0 · 243). When density patterns are compared, all three methods are capable of revealing the same trends. Differences are mainly due to the orientation of tree rings and the different characteristics of the indirect methods.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} windthrow resistance {{with respect}} to stem breakage, a nondestructive method for determining the shape of trunk cross sections was developed. In this method, the coordinates of multiple gauge points set on the perimeter of a trunk are calculated by measuring the distances between them.

Measurement tests were conducted using profile gauges with lengths of 300 and 900 mm on model specimens with four shape patterns and four different diameters. The accuracy of the estimation was verified by comparing the section modulus calculated for the generated image and for the photograph. The average ratio of section modulus (generated/photo) for all specimens was 0.994, which indicates that the proposed method is highly accurate. The section moduli of hollow trunks can be evaluated using the profile method together with the <b>drill</b> <b>resistance</b> technique on the condition that 26 % of the trunk diameter could be drilled without skew.|$|R
