5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans {{found that the}} number {{and shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These researchers found no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E
5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E

5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their {{instinct is to}} follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible {{for much of the}} damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} pitched and written by John Swartzwelder. The writing staff {{had to find}} a new angle for Homer's weight problems, as the idea had been used several times before. This was {{emphasized}} in this episode when Marge <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> care that Homer {{is going to try to}} lose weight again.|$|E
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E
5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose {{to him as}} a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have required extensive repairs.|$|E

5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} {{the text of}} the four Gospels based on the Vulgate. It does not, however, contain a pure copy of the Vulgate. There are numerous differences from the Vulgate, where Old Latin translations are used in lieu of Jerome's text. Although such variants are common in all the insular Gospels, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a consistent pattern of variation amongst the various insular texts. Evidence suggests that when the scribes were writing the text they often depended on memory rather than on their exemplar.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark {{is found}} off {{southern}} India and Sri Lanka, {{as well as}} from southern China and Taiwan to Java and Borneo. It may also occur in the Philippines and the Red Sea, though specimens from these regions need to be compared taxonomically with those from its confirmed range. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be very common naturally. This species inhabits continental and insular shelves from inshore waters to at least a depth of , and usually swims close to the sea floor.|$|E

5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E
5|$|This {{indicates}} {{the existence of}} two groups: Lucius Gellius Publicola eventually attacked Crixus {{and a group of}} some 30,000 followers who are described as being separate from the main group under Spartacus. Plutarch describes the desire of some of the escaped slaves to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. While this factional split is not contradicted by classical sources, there <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be any direct evidence to support it.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the period}} from 1066 to around 1500. Following {{the defeat of the}} Saxons by the Normans in 1066, various castles were set up in Somerset by the new lords such as that at Dunster, and the manors was awarded to {{followers}} of William the Conqueror such as William de Moyon and Walter of Douai. Somerset <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have played much part in the civil war in King Stephen's time, but Somerset lords were main players in the murder of Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|When Europeans first {{contacted}} Native Americans, some bows, {{especially in}} the area that became California, already had sinew backing. After the reintroduction of horses, newly mounted groups rapidly developed shorter bows, which were often given sinew backing. The full three-layer composite bow with horn, wood, and sinew <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be recorded in the Americas, and horn bows with sinew backing are not recorded before European contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
