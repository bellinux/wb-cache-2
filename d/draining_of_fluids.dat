50|$|In {{the first}} supernatural tradition, {{also called the}} demonological method, {{abnormal}} behaviors are attributed to agents outside human bodies. According to this model, abnormal behaviors are caused by demons, spirits, or the influences of moon, planets, and stars. During the Stone Age, trepanning was performed on those who had mental illness to literally cut the evil spirits out of the victim's head. Conversely, Ancient Chinese, Ancient Egyptians, and Hebrews, believed that these were evil demons or spirits and advocated exorcism. By {{the time of the}} Greeks and Romans, mental illnesses were thought to be caused by an imbalance of the four humors, leading to <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluids</b> from the brain. During the Medieval period, many Europeans believed that the power of witches, demons, and spirits caused abnormal behaviors. People with psychological disorders were thought to be possessed by evil spirits that had to be exercised through religious rituals. If exorcism failed, some authorities advocated steps such as confinement, beating, and other types of torture to make the body uninhabitable by witches, demons, and spirits. The belief that witches, demons, and spirits are responsible for the abnormal behavior continued into the 15th century. Swiss alchemist, astrologer, and physician Paracelsus (1493-1541), on the other hand, rejected the idea that abnormal behaviors were caused by witches, demons, and spirits and suggested that people's mind and behaviors were influenced by the movements of the moon and stars.|$|E

ICC were found primarily close to the intestinal myenteric plexus, and also in the submucosal plexus and septa of the muscle layers. Lack or absence of c-kit immunoreactivity in the gut has been associated with gastrointestinal motility disorders (Yamataka et al. 1995, Streutker et al. 2003). Recently, we have demonstrated the unique distri-bution of Cajal-like cells (CLC) in the normal upper urinary tract in humans and various animal species (Metzger et al. 2004, 2005).

40|$|We report {{capacitive}} {{measurements of}} the hysteresis and avalanche properties of 4 He in Nuclepore. Hysteresis was measured on global loops and subloops for Nuclepore with 30 nm and 200 nm diameter pores. Subloops exhibit the property of return point memory, but subloops between the same chemical potential end points were not congruent. The failure of congruence showed that the Preisach model, in which the pores do not interact, does not describe this system. Modification of the Preisach model to allow for pore intersection within the membrane resulted in qualitative agreement with the data. Using a model for hystersis by Mason which included pore-pore interactions, we calculated the pore size distribution for Nuclepore. ^ Close examination of the primary desorption curve resulted in the observation of large groups <b>of</b> pores <b>draining</b> together.

40|$|Abstract Background Prolonged and {{excessive}} drainage <b>of</b> serous <b>fluid</b> and seroma formation constitute {{the most common}} complications after mastectomy for breast carcinoma. Seroma formation delays wound healing, increases susceptibility to infection, skin flap necrosis, persistent pain and prolongs convalescence. For this, several techniques have been investigated to improve primary healing and minimize seroma formation. Materials and methods Between June 2009 and July 2010 forty patients with breast carcinoma, scheduled for modified radical mastectomy, were randomly divided into 2 groups, the study group (20) and the control group (20). In the study group; the mastectomy flaps were fixed to the underlying muscles in raws, at {{various parts of the}} flap and at the wound edge using fine absorbable sutures. In the control group; the wound was closed in the conventional method at the edges. Closed suction drains were used in both groups. Patients, tumor characteristics and operative related factors were recorded. The amount and color <b>of</b> <b>drained</b> <b>fluid</b> were recorded daily. The drains were removed when the amount become less than 50 cc. The total amount and duration <b>of</b> <b>drained</b> <b>fluid</b> and the formation of seroma were recorded and the results were compared between the two groups. Results In the flap fixation group, the drain was removed in significantly shorter time compared to the control group (p Conclusions The mastectomy flap fixation technique is a valuable procedure that significantly decreases the incidence of seroma formation, and reduces the duration and amount <b>of</b> <b>drained</b> <b>fluid.</b> However, it should be tried on a much wider scale to prove its validity. </p...|$|R
50|$|Treatment for cystic hygroma {{involves}} {{the removal of}} the abnormal tissue; however complete removal may be impossible without removing other normal areas. Surgical removal of the tumor is the typical treatment provided, with the understanding that additional removal procedures will most likely be required as the lymphangioma grows. Most patients need at least two procedures done for the removal process to be achieved. Recurrence is possible but unlikely for those lesions able to be removed completely via excisional surgery. Radiotherapy and chemical cauteries are not as effective with the lymphangioma than they are with the hemangioma. <b>Draining</b> lymphangiomas <b>of</b> <b>fluid</b> provides only temporary relief, so they are removed surgically.

40|$|AIM: There is recent {{interest}} in the measurement <b>of</b> peritoneal <b>fluid</b> cytokines in the early post operative period, to help diagnose anastomotic leakage at a preclinical stage. The currently available literature on the early diagnosis of colorectal anastomotic leakage by estimation <b>of</b> <b>drain</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokines or matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is reviewed. METHOD: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library for all publications studying the feasibility to diagnose colorectal anastomotic leakage earlier, by estimation <b>of</b> peritoneal <b>fluid</b> cytokine or MMP levels. A meta-analysis {{of the most commonly}} measured cytokines was performed. RESULTS: Eight publications were included. Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) were most frequently studied. Most studies found significantly higher levels of TNF-α and IL- 6 in patients with anastomotic leakage during the first three post-operative days. In the meta-analysis IL- 6 levels were significantly higher from day 1 and TNF-α from day 2. MMP- 9 was most often significantly elevated in patients with anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSION: Measurement <b>of</b> <b>drain</b> <b>fluid</b> cytokines and MMP has the potential to diagnose colorectal anastomotic leakage at a pre-clinical stage, but is not yet ready for clinical use.

However, as the drainage becomes established, the spreading slows, {{and in fact the}} fluid only spreads a finite distance before it has fully drained into the underlying layer. We examine the sensitivity of the results to the initial conditions through numerical solution of the governing equations. We find that for sources of sufficiently large initial aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of height to length), the solution converges rapidly to the initially self-similar regime. For longer and shallower initial source conditions, this convergence does not occur, but we derive estimates for the run-out length of the current, which compare favourably with our numerical data.
