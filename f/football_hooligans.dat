5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' {{hooligan}} firms has been covered in {{books such as}} Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. No One Likes Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious <b>Football</b> <b>Hooligans</b> by Andrew Woods focuses on the fights between the two firms, {{from the perspective of}} Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E
5|$|Before the final, both finalists {{were awarded}} 12,000 tickets. The Danish Football Association {{announced}} that 9,000 tickets would be offered, {{for sale to}} the public, while the remaining 3,000 were sold to other European countries. UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members. Problems ensued after {{it was revealed that}} Galatasaray had been charging the tickets more than the original price, in order to prevent some <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> from entering the ground. The Turkish club's secretary general however, denied this and insisted that the tickets were being sold at their original price and to support the stadium and the club's other sporting activities.|$|E

25|$|Only {{days after}} the Croatian {{elections}} in 1990, Ražnatović, who {{was the leader of}} the Delije (football club Red Star Belgrade's Ultras), was present at the away game against Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb at Stadion Maksimir on 13 May 1990, a match that ended in the infamous Dinamo–Red Star riot. Ražnatović and the Delije, consisting of 1,500 people, were involved in a huge fight with the home team's <b>football</b> <b>hooligans.</b>|$|E
25|$|Acid {{house was}} also popular in Manchester. The Thunderdome (which was {{generally}} advertised as a Techno night) in Miles Platting {{was at the}} epicenter of the scene and gave rise to acts like 808 State, Jam MC's, Steve Williams and Jay Wearden. The genre was extremely popular with the city's <b>football</b> <b>hooligans.</b> According to Manchester United football hooligan Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of a Little Red Devil, the acid house venues were the only place where rival hooligan gangs would mix without coming to blows with one another.|$|E

25|$|The 1984–85 {{season was}} Liverpool's first trophyless season in ten years, {{though they did}} reach their fifth European Cup final against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium, Brussels, Belgium. This final was to end in {{disaster}} as, before the match kicked off, rioting <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 Juventus supporters. The game ended in a 1–0 win for Juventus. Liverpool were beaten to the title by neighbours Everton, who were crowned champions with four matches to spare. The sequel to the ban was an indefinite ban on all English clubs in European competition, with Liverpool set to serve an extra season once the ban was lifted on other English clubs. This meant that Rush and Liverpool were unable {{to compete in the}} 1985–86 UEFA Cup.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, {{monuments to}} Antonescu were raised and streets were {{named after him}} in Bucharest and several other cities. Among those {{directly}} involved in this process were Iosif Constantin Drăgan, the nationalist Mayor of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar, and General Mircea Chelaru, whose resignation from the Army was subsequently requested and obtained. Also during that interval, in 1993, filmmaker and Social Democratic politician Sergiu Nicolaescu produced Oglinda, which depicts Antonescu (played by Ion Siminie) apologetically. The rehabilitation trend was also represented at an October 1994 commemorative exhibit at the National Military Museum. The same year, a denialist documentary film, Destinul mareșalului ("The Marshal's Destiny"), was distributed by state-owned companies, a matter which raised concern. After the Wiesel Commission presented its findings and such public endorsement was outlawed, statues in Antonescu's likeness were torn down or otherwise made unavailable for public viewing. An unusual case is that of his Saints Constantine and Helena Church, where, after lengthy debates, his bust was sealed inside a metal box. Outside of this context, the publicized display of Antonescu's portraits and racist slogans by <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> during Liga I's 2005–2006 season prompted UEFA intervention (see Racism Breaks the Game).|$|E
500|$|Tyndall {{had grown}} distant from Webster {{over a number}} of differences, and in the late 1970s began blaming him for the party's problems. Webster had for {{instance}} disagreed with Tyndall's support for Chesterton's leadership, while Tyndall was upset with Webster's attempts to encourage more skinheads and <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> to join the party. Tyndall in particular began criticizing the fact that Webster was a homosexual, emphasising allegations that Webster had been making sexual advances toward young men in the party. More widely, he complained about a [...] "homosexual network" [...] among leading NF members. In October 1979 he called a meeting of the NF directorate at which he urged them to call for Webster's resignation. At the meeting Webster apologised for his conduct, and the directorate stood by him against Tyndall. Angered, Tyndall then tried convincing the directorate to grant him greater powers in his position as chairman, but they refused. Tyndall resigned in January 1980, subsequently referring to the party as the [...] "gay National Front".|$|E

500|$|By the 1970s, a {{combination}} of the recession, overpriced food, and fear of <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> had greatly reduced the services' popularity. The quality of the food declined substantially and, because of its prominent location, the services became a byword for poor catering. Roy Harper wrote a song criticising the food at the Watford Gap on his 1977 album, Bullinamingvase, writing: [...] "Watford Gap, Watford Gap / A plate of grease and a load of crap". The owners of Watford Gap service station objected to criticism of their food, as did an EMI board member who was also a non-executive director of Blue Boar. Harper defended his decision to write the song, claiming the food was [...] "junk. Absolute junk". [...] In 1989, one journalist claimed the services had some of the worst food found on the road network, adding [...] "if I threw the toast out of the window, it would probably still be bouncing up the M1." [...] Roadchef purchased the motorway businesses from Blue Boar in 1995 and have since improved facilities. In 2011 and 2012 it was rated as 3 stars by quality assessors at Visit England.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall had {{observed}} the electoral success achieved by Jean-Marie Le Pen and the French National Front during the 1980s, {{and hoped that}} by learning from their activities he could improve the BNP's electoral prospects. He saw the issue as being one of credibility among the electorate, declaring that [...] "we {{should be looking for}} ways to overcome our present image of weakness and smallness". He ignored the significant impact that had been achieved by the French NF through moderating its policies and thereby gaining greater respectability among the electorate. While Tyndall had sought to keep skinheads and <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> out of the BNP, he still kept a range of Holocaust deniers and convicted criminals close to him. He expressed the view that [...] "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to our public". Conversely, in the early 1990s a 'moderniser' faction emerged in the party that favoured a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by Le Pen's move to disassociate his party from biological racism and focus on the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. Tyndall opposed many of the modernisers' ideas and sought to stem their growing influence in the party, ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} and traditional rivalry for Genoa, is the inner-city {{one with the}} club with whom they share a ground; Sampdoria. The two clubs compete together in the heated Derby della Lanterna ("Derby of the Lantern"); {{a reference to the}} Lighthouse of Genoa. Genoa's supporters also have a strong distaste for AC Milan. After a clash between opposing supporters in January 1995 resulted in the death of Genoese Vincenzo Spagnolo, who was stabbed to death by Milanese Simone Barbaglia. The assailant was a member of an informal group of <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> dubbed [...] "The Barbour Ones", who used to routinely carry bladed weapons to matches, a practice made possible by the leaky security measures of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Membership was {{restricted}} to ethnic Ukrainians, and for a period the party did not accept atheists or {{former members of the}} Communist Party. In the internet could be found an information that {{in the second half of}} 1990s the party also recruited skinheads and <b>football</b> <b>hooligans.</b> Media was accusing the party in criminal fighting which resulted in physical elimination of criminal elements of the Caucasus region from the West Ukraine. The SNPU's official program defined itself as an [...] "irreconcilable enemy of Communist ideology" [...] and all other parties to be either collaborators and enemies of the Ukrainian revolution, or romanticists. According to Svoboda's website, during the 1994 Ukrainian parliamentary elections the party presented its platform as distinct from those of the communists and social democrats. SNPU did not win any seats to the national parliament, but managed to receive some seats in the Lviv Regional Council.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, it was {{revealed}} that a Guardian journalist, Ian Cobain, had worked undercover in the BNP for seven months, becoming the party's central London organiser. Among the accusations made by the paper was that the BNP used [...] "techniques of secrecy and deception... in its attempt to conceal its activities and intentions from the public". It asserted that the BNP operated with a [...] "network of false identities" [...] and organised rendezvous points to allow members to be directed to [...] "clandestine meetings". Party members were directed to avoid [...] "any racist or anti-semitic language in public". Cobain also claimed that the membership in central London had expanded beyond the party's traditional range, now including [...] "dozens of company directors, computing entrepreneurs, bankers and estate agents, and a handful of teachers". Following the report, the campaign group Unite Against Fascism called for ballerina Simone Clarke to be dismissed from the English National Ballet, because her views on immigration were [...] "incompatible with a leading arts institution such as the English National Ballet" [...] and because she had [...] "used her position to support a party which fosters division". Clarke said: [...] "the BNP is the only party to take a stand against immigration". The BNP was investigated by the Electoral Commission in 2007, after The Guardian revealed that it had set up a front organisation to raise money from sympathisers in the United States. Later in 2007, three BNP councillors resigned. In Epping, Terry Farr resigned after suspension for writing abusive letters to Trevor Phillips. In Sandwell, James Lloyd was disqualified for not attending any meetings. In Blackburn, Robin Evans left the party and wrote a letter to his former colleagues denouncing it as a party of drug-dealers and <b>football</b> <b>hooligans.</b> Evans remains a councillor, describing himself as a [...] "national socialist".|$|E
2500|$|While the German Police {{expressed}} {{satisfaction in}} their ability to contain and deal with hooliganism, speculation was rife that a number of potential flashpoints existed which could cause widespread public disorder. With a number of routes into the country, amongst them the open land borders which are a consequence of the Schengen agreement, apprehension of known troublemakers and organisers of disturbances looked to be a very real problem. However, during the World Cup, Germany suspended its rules granting passport-free travel to EU citizens. As an illustration of this, on 8 June, German police apprehended 9 English hooligans attempting to enter the country via the Czech border. Britain has a particularly stringent policy of restricting foreign travel of known <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> during periods where the England team are involved. 3,500 banning orders were served, and by 8 June all but 150 had surrendered their passports. On 9 June Channel 4 News in the UK reported that although there had been no violence, England fans in Frankfurt had been kicking footballs at the windows of the city's 600-year-old Römer city hall building, although local police decided not to take action over this minor incident and the staff at the Mayor's office apparently took the attempted vandalism in good humour. On the day of England's first match against Paraguay two England fans were arrested for having swastikas and SS insignia painted on their bodies. The two were flown back to England to appear in court; one was found guilty and banned from attending football matches until 2008, while the other was not banned as the symbol (the double-sig rune of the SS) was painted on his back, and he may {{not have been able to}} see it or known what it was. [...] The court heard that the fan found guilty also had a letter J on his arm, believed to be a slight to Jews, but claimed not to know its meaning.|$|E
