50|$|Marine outfalls for {{partially}} treated or untreated wastewater remain controversial. Still {{according to}} Sharon Beder, the <b>design</b> <b>calculation</b> and computer models for pollution modeling have been criticized, arguing that dilution has been overemphasized {{and that other}} mechanisms work in the opposite direction, such as bioaccumulation of toxins, sedimentation of sludge particles and agglomeration of sewage particles with grease. Accumulative mechanisms include slick formation, windrow formation, flocculate formation and agglomerated formation. Grease or wax can interfere with dispersion, so that bacteria and viruses could be carried to remote locations where the concentration of bacterial predators would be low and the die-off rate much lower.|$|E

50|$|The {{engineering}} and industrial phase began in early 1945. This phase {{can be considered}} phase of the project. It is said that Kurchatov was caught nodding when a new political situation arose after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The second phase began on August 20, 1945 when the State Defense Committee {{made the decision to}} set up a Special Committee, a Technical Board, and the First Main Administration to be put in charge of the implementation of the atomic project. Kurchatov and his team were in charge finding out new problems, at the time, unknown to scientists. This team acted as research supervisors of major engineering projects, which include: the startup of the first physical reactor, Ph (1946); the design, construction, and startup of plants for plutonium production, radiochemical extraction, and metallurgy (Kurchatov, plants A, B, V, Chelyabinsk- 40, in 1948 and 1949); the development of a physical reactor and an industrial heavy-water one (Alikhanov, Laboratory no. 3, 1949; OK-180, Chelyabinsk-40, 1951); the development of a manufacturing technology of diffusion separation of uranium-235 and uranium-238 (I.K. Kikoin, plant D-1, Sverdlovsk-65, 1949-1951); the development of industrial mass separators for the electromagnetic separation of isotopes of uranium (L.A. Artsimovich, SU-20, Sverdlovsk- 45, 1950); and, finally, the <b>design</b> <b>calculation,</b> modeling, construction, and production of the first atomic bomb (Khariton, Arzamas-16, 1946-1949). During this industrial phase, Kurchatov’s team of engineers, those on construction sites, plant floors, and research laboratories completed these missions within three years in 1942 to 1945 (Gaponov). The results of these missions were the solution to the Soviet’s nuclear safety.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{introduction}} of flexible explosion rated stoppings {{has become an}} item of interest to many supply, contract and mining companies {{in the last few}} years. These ventilation devices are characterized by the fixing of various fabrics with direct bolt attachments to the mine roadway perimeter.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of small molecule transition state structures into protein <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> poses special challenges {{because of the}} need to represent the added translational, rotational, and conformational freedoms within an already difficult optimization problem. Successful approaches to computational enzyme design have focused on catalytic side-chain contacts to guide placement of small molecules in active sites. We describe a process for modeling small molecules in enzyme <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> that extends previously described methods, allowing favorable small molecule positions and conformations to be explored simultaneously with sequence optimization. Because all current computational enzyme design methods rely heavily on sampling of possible active site geometries from discrete conformational states, we tested the effects of discretization parameters on calculation results. Rotational and translational step sizes as well as side-chain library types were varied in a series of computational tests designed to identify native-like binding contacts in three natural systems. We find that conformational parameters, especially the type of rotamer library used, significantly affect the ability of <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> to recover native binding site geometries. We describe the construction and use of a crystallographic conformer library, and find that it more reliably captures active-site geometries than traditional rotamer libraries in the systems tested. 14...|$|R
