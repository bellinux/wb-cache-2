As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Kombo Moyana series {{refers to}} a series of {{banknotes}} which carried Kombo Moyana's signature after being appointed governor of the Reserve Bank from 1983 to August 1993. The series bears the new name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last two series except for the date and signature.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
50|$|As it panned out, Burnie and Glenorchy led the {{competition}} for almost the entire season, with Clarence making a late charge after an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
50|$|He became {{assistant}} manager of Weston-super-Mare under his former Newport manager Len Ashurst and took full {{charge of the}} club in 1998. He was sacked in October 2001 after an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
50|$|Gertrude, a peripatetic nun, only {{accessible}} on {{the telephone}} at her own convenience. She grants prosaic and <b>indifferent</b> advice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inner circle and has an apparently godlike awareness of what is said in her absence.|$|R
5|$|The Gospel of Luke {{says the}} census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius was {{governor}} of Syria. Tipler suggests this took place in AD 6, nine years {{after the death of}} Herod, and that the family of Jesus left Bethlehem shortly after the birth. Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of the Gospel of Luke, concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or <b>indifferent</b> <b>to,</b> <b>the</b> chronological difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberation of}} Belgium begun in September 1944 as Allied forces moved eastwards. Brussels was liberated on 3 September. On 8 September, Pierlot and the {{government}} in exile arrived in the city by aeroplane. The return of the government was met with general indifference by the population, which felt the government had been <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plight of the population during the occupation.|$|E
50|$|He {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second flight with LR Ahlen in October 2000. His {{first season}} brought a 7th-place finish, but an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2001-02 season saw him leaving {{the club for}} fellow 2. Bundesliga outfit VfL Bochum.|$|R
50|$|However some of {{the other}} members were <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> {{committee}} and <b>the</b> committee never met with the total number of representatives. Later (1927) Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in his Nutuk (Great speech) complained of the indifference of {{some of the}} committee members.|$|R
50|$|He led <b>the</b> club <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final of the League Cup and the semi-finals of the FAI Cup in 2009, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{promotion}} play-offs {{the following}} season.

5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to {{a dozen or more}} birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, {{but other than that}} he was <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> populace. He was finally overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). <b>Indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
2500|$|When Doc {{returns home}} to his beach house, he is greeted by Shasta, who has {{returned}} and is <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> trouble her disappearance has caused.

[...] She and Doc have sex; and when she tells him [...] "It doesn't mean we're back together," [...] Doc replies, [...] "Of course not!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On 20 September 2007, Mourinho left Chelsea by [...] "mutual consent" [...] {{following}} an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> season and {{after several months}} of well-documented friction between Mourinho and Abramovich. Shortly afterwards, Israeli Avram Grant, who had been appointed Chelsea's director of football on 8 July 2007, was announced as Mourinho's successor.|$|R
50|$|The club made an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> League campaign, winning four, drawing {{three and}} losing {{four of their}} first eleven games before embarking on a run of nine {{consecutive}} victories from November to January that took them top {{of the table and}} marked them as favourites to win their second League Title.|$|R
5|$|Karas {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} version of Shinjuku, Tokyo. The show {{initially}} showcased larger areas of Tokyo, but the production team felt other animations have featured these areas too many times. Art designer, Hajime Satō created a modern version of the ward infused with a mixture of East Asian cultures. Fictional lettering, resembling Chinese and Hangul characters, fill the billboards and signs. Western gargoyles and Singapore's Merlion statues decorate the streets, and the buildings are modeled on Shinjuku structures of 2003 while blending influences from the Shōwa period. This Shinjuku is populated by humans and Japanese folklore spirits, yōkai. The humans have become <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> yōkais presence, and fail to see them as they go about their lives.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888. <b>Indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued to be thought of as a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{justified}} {{his ideas}} by {{his belief in}} an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of noblesse oblige, which asserted that the aristocracy {{had an obligation to}} be generous and honourable; to Disraeli, this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies; one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that, should the ruling class become <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.|$|E
50|$|After an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} season, he {{came off}} <b>the</b> bench <b>to</b> score <b>the</b> winner away <b>to</b> Bolton Wanderers on 15 September 2001. He scored at a regular rate {{over the next}} three months including the winner in a 1-0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 24 November - Saints first win in their new St Mary's Stadium.|$|R
50|$|Gilbert {{completed}} {{his high school}} career setting a state record of 12,534 passing yards, breaking the previous mark set by Graham Harrell by two-yards. Gilbert initially was <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> breaking <b>the</b> record {{when he had the}} chance during the 2008 state title game; he only did so after his coach insisted. Gilbert finished second to Harrell for career touchdowns, completions and attempts. He led his Cavaliers to a 39-4 combined record as a starter from his sophomore through senior seasons.|$|R

5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added little to the {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally agreeing with the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues. From the 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice of kingship, and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E
25|$|Seeing {{little sense}} in a {{principle}} requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the final anthropic principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into {{existence in the}} universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.|$|E

In one of the farms, the cow’s beddings, were located indoor, and in the second one outdoor under the roof.

50|$|Due to {{considerable}} {{difficulties with}} the language barrier, personal health problems, and other incidents, the mission work had little success throughout the later years, especially during the 36-year period of the Japanese colonial rule. This colonial rule caused significant obstacles to Church development in Korea, primarily because those missionaries appeared <b>to</b> have an <b>indifferent</b> attitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Korean independence movement at that time.|$|R
25|$|Much of the {{population}} of Soviet Central Asia was <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collapse of the Soviet Union, even the large Russian populations in Kazakhstan (roughly 40% of the total) and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Aid from the Kremlin had also been central to the economies of Central Asia, each of the republics receiving massive transfers of funds from Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{majority}} of Roman Catholic, conservative population were <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new state, officials and politicians had to be imported from neighboring cantons. The canton was divided and some municipalities sought affiliations with other cantons: the Lutheran congregations in the Limmattal wanted to affiliate with Zürich, the Amt of Hitzkirch with Lucerne, and the upper Freiamt with Zug or Schwyz.|$|E
25|$|Gore easily {{defeated}} Bradley in the primaries, {{largely because}} {{of support from the}} Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary. On March 14, Al Gore clinched the Democratic nomination.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Rockdale parted {{ways with}} Branko Culina after an <b>indifferent</b> start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NPL NSW season, {{appointing}} the experienced player Paul Reid as Player/Coach.

The turn of fortunes since his appointment saw Paul Reid retain the Head Coach role for the 2016 season, helped by assistant Matthew Ribarovski.|$|R
50|$|Allen's out-of-town job is {{affecting}} {{his relationship with}} Maria, so he decides to quit and propose to her. When he arrives in Montverde, he finds significant changes there. Maria, who earlier had hinted at marriage, now seems <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> it. <b>The</b> town is practically uninhabited and has a much darker air about it, and tattoo parlors and seedy shops have replaced the nice stores that once lined the main street. When Allen begins to investigate, he discovers the dreadful virus has forced the town people into self-mutilation.|$|R
2500|$|While <b>the</b> {{biosphere}} is <b>indifferent</b> <b>to</b> whether <b>the</b> {{greenhouse gases}} {{are produced by}} one country or by a multitude, {{the countries of the}} world do express an interest in such matters.
