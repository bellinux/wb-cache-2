50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of this plant {{is still being}} studied; the name and number of varieties have {{changed over the years}} and are still in flux. In 1982 the rare variety kalaeloana was added to the endangered species list of the United States. This plant was and still is known only from Oahu's Ewa Plains between Kalaeloa (Barber's Point) and Pearl Harbor. It had been reduced in population by a number of factors, including Navy activity, pollution, destruction by bulldozer on private property, quarrying, agriculture, <b>fire,</b> <b>development</b> and construction of housing, roads, an oil refinery, and resort property, and expansion of the harbor. The plant's human-caused decline probably started {{with the arrival of the}} Polynesians. Other threats include non-native plant species, especially kaunaoa pehu (Cassytha filiformis), kiawe (Prosopis pallida), Chinese violet (Asystasia gangetica), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris). Potentially damaging insects that visit the plant include croton moth (Aechaea janata) and spiraling whitefly (Aleurodicus dispersus).|$|E

These fumes include ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and nitrous fumes. The nitrous fumes have a characteristic yellow-brown colour. Initially, these fumes are released at the edges of the panels, but they also build up inside the sandwich panels themselves.|$|E

30|$|The {{investigation}} of fires {{is one of}} the more complicated forensic sciences due to the continuously altered or destroyed evidence by the fire itself. Fire is a highly three-dimensional, time-variant process with time-variant boundary conditions. The other difficulty for forensic scientists investigating fires is that the observations of damage after the fire may often times be independent of the path taken by the fire making it difficult to identify where the fire started. Thus, a fire investigator must have a solid grasp of the physics and variables that influence a <b>fire’s</b> <b>development,</b> as well as how these variables may or may not have influenced the damage outcome.|$|R
40|$|The five {{relative}} {{energy release}} criteria (RERC) {{which are a}} first step towards formulating a unified concept {{that can be applied}} to the development of fires in enclosures, place upper bounds on the rate and amount of energy released during a fire. They are independent, calculated readily, and may be applied generally to any enclosure regardless of size. They are useful in pretest planning and for interpreting experimental data. Data from several specific fire test programs were examined to evaluate the potential use of RERC to provide test planning guidelines. The RERC were compared with experimental data obtained in full-scale enclosures. These results confirm that in general the RERC do identify the proper limiting constraints on enclosure <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and determine the bounds of the <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> envelope. Plotting actual fire data against the RERC reveals new valid insights into fire behavior and reveals the controlling constraints in <b>fire</b> <b>development.</b> The RERC were calculated and plotted for several descrpitions of full-scale fires in various aircraft compartments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{consisting of}} experiments {{and analysis of}} <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> in a passenger train carriage. The aim {{of this research is}} to use experiments, particularly a full-scale passenger train fire experiment, to increase understanding of fire behaviour in passenger trains and evaluate existing design fire estimation methods applied to passenger trains. A design fire represents a <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> scenario in terms of a heat release rate (HRR) vs time curve. The design fire is the most critical input affecting fire safety design of trains, tunnels and surrounding infrastructure. Large fires involving at least an entire carriage are rare but can result in severe consequences and require design consideration. Current understanding of <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> on passenger trains is limited. Very limited experimental research has been conducted, particularly full-scale HRR measurement of entire carriages. As a result, existing methods for design fire estimation applied to trains are based on crude assumptions and appropriate design fires for passenger trains are uncertain...|$|E

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} {{temperature distribution}} in flashover fire {{is a key}} issue for evacuation and fire-fighting. Now many good flashover fire experiments have be conducted, {{but most of these}} experiments are proceeded in enclosure with fixed openings; researches on <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and temperature distribution in flashover caused by backdraft fire did not receive enough attention. In order to study flashover phenomenon caused by backdraft fire, a full-scale fire experiment was conducted in one abandoned office building. Process of <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> and temperature distribution in room and corridor were separately recorded during the experiment. The experiment shows that <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> in enclosure is closely affected by the room ventilation. Unlike existing temperature curves which have only one temperature peak, temperature in flashover caused by backdraft may have more than one peak value {{and that there is a}} linear relationship between maximum peak temperature and distance away from fire compartment. Based on BFD curve and experimental data, mathematical models are proposed to predict temperature curve in flashover fire caused by backdraft at last. These conclusions and experiment data obtained in this paper could provide valuable reference to fire simulation, hazard assessment, and fire protection design...|$|E

The fire size has strong influence, while the roof opening area has weak influence on the average rate of gas temperature rise. In the early stage of a fire, the <b>fire</b> <b>development</b> will slow down with the increase of roof opening area.

Fire patterns are defined as the “visible or measurable physical changes, or identifiable shapes, formed by a fire effect or group of fire effects” (NFPA 2014).
