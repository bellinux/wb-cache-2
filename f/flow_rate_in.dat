25|$|Full-Flow Filtration — Full-flow {{filtration}} continuously strains particulates out of {{the entire}} system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>In</b> this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the discharge side of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|The fastest {{reactions}} {{tend to be}} in {{the order}} of triple-bonded > double-bonded > single bonded molecules, and also lower molecular weight molecules are faster than higher ones. So acetylene is faster than ethylene, and ethylene is faster than propene, etc. The molecular weight factor in polymer deposition is dependent on the monomer <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>in</b> which a higher molecular weight monomer typically near 200 g/mol needs a much higher flow rate of 15 g/cm2, whereas lower molecular weights around 50 g/mol require a flow rate of only 5 g/cm2. A heavy monomer therefore needs a faster flow, and would likely lead to increased pressures, decreasing polymerization rates.|$|E
25|$|Weirs allow hydrologists and {{engineers}} a simple method of measuring the volumetric <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since {{the geometry of}} the top of the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the depth of water behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows {{over the top of the}} weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits/sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make flow measurement complicated, inaccurate or even impossible.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{characteristic}} speed U and sound speed are essentially the same, {{it can be}} rewritten as the second equation. This equation has the same structure as the one for the point monopole shown above. Although the amplitude factor A replaces the dimensionless volumetric <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> these equations, the speed dependence strongly confirms the monopole-like characteristics of the Hartmann whistle. A cousin to the Hartmann whistle {{is shown in the}} figure on the right, the Galton whistle. Here the cavity is excited by an annular jet which oscillates symmetrically around the sharp edges of the cavity. It appears to be a circular version of the edge tone (discussed below) in which the symmetry of the otherwise dipole source of the edge tone is converted to a monopole source.|$|E
25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, but enough to cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E
25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction {{has been defined as}} any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes used to describe the symptom {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either xerostomia or salivary gland hypofunction.|$|E

2500|$|To {{demonstrate}} how {{time and space}} constraints of individual-level interactions affect colony function, social insect network approaches can also incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.

40|$|During {{operation}} in the sea the reactor natural circulation behaviors are affected by ship rolling motion. The development of an analysis code and the natural circulation behaviors of a reactor simulator under rolling motion are described in this paper. In the case of rolling motion, the primary coolant <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> the hot legs and heating channels oscillated periodically, and the amplitude of <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> oscillation was <b>in</b> direct proportion to rolling amplitude, but in inverse proportion to rolling period. The total mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> also oscillated with half the rolling period, and the average total mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was less than that in steady state. In the natural circulation under a rolling motion, the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> oscillations <b>in</b> the hot legs were controlled by the tangential force; however, the mass <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> oscillations <b>in</b> the total natural circulation and the heating channels were {{a result of the}} combined action of the change of inclination angle, flow resistance, and the extra force arising from the rolling motion.
