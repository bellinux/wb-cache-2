5|$|Miz {{was drafted}} from SmackDown! to ECW on June 17, 2007, {{as part of}} the 2007 {{supplemental}} draft. He was absent from the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> ECW, though he was the subject of backstage mentions between matches and had several short Miz TV Crashes ECW video segments. He made his debut on the July 10 episode of ECW in a match against Nunzio, which he won.|$|E
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce spent the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as {{he sought to}} represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, {{forced out of the}} group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
50|$|The film grossed $472,892 in Canada {{over its}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> As <b>of</b> April 17, 2011, the film had grossed $4.3 {{million in the}} United States {{and a total of}} $8 million {{worldwide}}. Most of the worldwide box office was in Italy.|$|R
25|$|On June 28, 1995, Reeve {{was taken}} to the Kessler Rehabilitation Center in West Orange, New Jersey. He was given several blood transfusions in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> because <b>of</b> very low {{hemoglobin}} and protein levels. Many times his breathing tube would become disconnected and he would be at the mercy of nurses to come in and save his life.|$|R
50|$|The Rancho Los Amigos Scale is {{a complex}} scale that has eight {{separate}} levels, and is often used in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months <b>of</b> coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.|$|R
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> winter, the eastern half of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the eastern half of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> 2010, {{there was}} renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn {{made it difficult}} for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the tour, {{as he struggled to}} adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
5000|$|Very severe SMA (type 0/1) can be {{sometimes}} evident {{before birth}} - reduction in fetal {{movement in the}} final months of pregnancy.

5000|$|Schulz and {{cartoonist}} Jim Sasseville (who also assisted Schulz on Peanuts {{stories for}} various comic books) produced this strip {{which appeared in}} newspapers four times a week, including Sundays. Schulz created the strip and produced the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> worth <b>of</b> strips himself; after that, while Schulz was {{responsible for most of}} the written content and rough artwork, Sasseville was brought on board to provide some of the gags and all the finished artwork, done in Schulz's style. (Schulz continued to receive sole credit for the comic.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The offstage {{voice was}} {{originally}} played by Jennie Sullivan, Arthur Sullivan's cousin {{under the name}} J. Hervey. The role is not mentioned after the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months <b>of</b> the run. Jessie Bond in her autobiography mentions her spoonerism [...] "The missus is having such a cow with the rabman", which comes from this piece.|$|R
5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was more}} often {{substitute}} than starter in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> 2012–13 under new manager Robert Maaskant, but {{went on to}} re-establish himself in the side. A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or just not being selected. Groningen finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning to Earth. When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero.|$|E

Only those cases survived in which the spinal cord lesion was a partial one " (Cushing 1927). Nowadays, this has been reversed. In well...|$|R
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months <b>of</b> infection. It usually occurs unnoticed {{because it is}} symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|R
50|$|A poorly {{functioning}} {{pituitary gland}} may also cause {{a lack of}} thyroid hormone, leading to central hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is critical for growth and brain development, especially during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> to months <b>of</b> life. Children with untreated hypothyroidism {{are at high risk}} of mental retardation; thus, early detection is crucial. Central hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by a low or normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{in the presence of a}} low level of free T4. Free T-4 should be checked annually for at least four years.|$|R
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|With {{this dispute}} settled {{collaboration}} could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists {{as possible so}} long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat {{refused to give up}} his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so that he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.|$|E
5|$|As the {{invasion}} began, the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla {{activity in the}} area, with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration. Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, {{some of which were}} orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen, broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> Operation Barbarossa, 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10,000 Jews, {{and by the end of}} 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, SS-Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled, the less likely the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours.|$|E
50|$|Infantile hemangiomas {{typically}} {{develop in}} the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months <b>of</b> life. They are more common in Caucasians, in premature children whose birth weight is less than 3 lb, in females, and in twin births. Early lesions may resemble a red scratch or patch, a white patch, or a bruise. The majority of hemangiomas occur {{on the head and}} neck, but they can occur almost anywhere. The appearance and color of the hemangioma depends on its location and depth within the level of the skin.|$|R
40|$|Intranasal {{instillation}} of Mycobacterium lepraemurium (MLM) into mice produced pulmonary infection. MLM multiplied {{rapidly in}} the lung tissue during the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> without involvement <b>of</b> other organs. The increase in number, size and confluence of lung granulomas paralleled the multiplication of MLM which could be found both intracellularly and extracellularly. It is postulated that extracellular bacteria may {{find their way to}} the bloodstream and thus spread to other visceral organs. Extensive destruction of alveoli and occupation of airspaces by lepra-like cells invariably occurred as the disease progressed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized his mistake and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{eight to}} nine months, {{following}} which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are born. In a 2004 {{study in the}} Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 {{percent of the total}} calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. Young males would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
40|$|This book {{is written}} to give pre-service and {{graduate}} teachers {{an opportunity to}} reflect on their own behaviour as it applies to classroom and student management. It is particularly directed at supporting graduate teachers who are having second thoughts about remaining in the profession, and especially those, who in their <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hectic <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> teaching, are considering resigning. The over-arching purpose of this book is to guide teachers to become more resilient and competent so that they will enjoy a successful teaching career. By modelling and teaching resiliency you will create a harmonious classroom where students feel they belong. Vignettes from June’s field work are sprinkled quite liberally throughout this book to illustrate the kind of experiences teachers may encounter. There are ten chapters in this book, each one taking you closer to becoming a successful manager of classroom and student behaviour...|$|R
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, I {{was working on a}} project of {{studying}} the tunnelling mechanism and spin excitations of a single magnetic atom on a CuN island. My tasks involved analysis of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy data acquired by Dr. Cyrus Hirjibehedin at IBM, and some modelling by using Mathematica. During the <b>first</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the project, I learned to use Origin to analyse the conductance spectra (differential conductance dV dI against applied voltage bias V) to understand the spin-dependent tunnelling mechanisms. By observing the spectra, we were able to determine that the elastic tunnelling is in fact composed of two parts: the spin-independent elastic conductance which was previously identified [1] and a spin-dependent elastic part which had not previously been recognized. By describing these processes using higher-order perturbation theory, we also were able to verify the existence of a new sum rule, which states that the sum of spin-dependent elastic and inelastic conductance parts is independent o...|$|R
50|$|Ohtahara {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} but severe epilepsy syndrome usually starting in the <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days or <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> life. The seizures are often {{in the form of}} stiffening spasms but other seizures including unilateral ones may be seen. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is characteristic. The prognosis is poor with about half of the infants dying {{in the first year of}} life; most if not all surviving infants are severely intellectually disabled and many have cerebral palsy. There is no effective treatment. A number of children have underlying structural brain abnormalities.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed in late November, and two disturbances {{formed in the}} <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> January. In the duration between when Iletta developed on January23 and when Tropical Cyclone Josie formed on February9, another two {{tropical disturbance}}s formed, and the final two developed after Lisette originated in late February. The first, Tropical Disturbance M1, formed on May11 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and later crossed into the Australian region to intensify into Tropical Cyclone Rhonda. The final disturbance of the season originated from a persistent area of convection near the equator on July19, northeast of Diego Garcia. With warm enough water temperatures, the system developed further, becoming Tropical Depression M2 on July20, the first July depression since 1971. That day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01S. As the JTWC considers the tropical cyclone year to begin on July1, and the MFR considered it beginning on August1 at the time, the storm was in different cyclone years in different agencies. Estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested that the system approached tropical storm status on July21 after a central dense overcast formed, although the MFR only estimated peak 10minute winds of 55km/h (35mph). Moving southwestward and later to the west, the depression began weakening due to wind shear on July23, and dissipated two days later. At the time, July was within the annual tropical cyclone year, although a change in policy shifted {{the end of the}} tropical cyclone year to June30, beginning in 2002.|$|E

40|$|The {{emphasis}} on the class struggle in revolutionary thinking has obscured the significance of traditional sex roles and nowhere is this more apparent than in the mistaken belief that child rearing is, of necessity, the responsibility of women. In fact, other than the optional <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> or months <b>of</b> breast feeding, there is no biological connection between the bearing of children and their rearing. Women both in and outside the Women’s Liberation movement are busily mouthing this radical idea, but {{it is evident that}} as far as their own lives are concerned, and in their attitudes to others, it remains an empty ideal...|$|R
