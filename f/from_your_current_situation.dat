40|$|One {{approach}} to understanding “reasons”—including both reasons for action and reasons for belief—postulates a fundamental connection between reasons and reasoning. According to this approach, {{there is a}} reason for you to φ—where φ-ing could be either an action (such as writing a letter) or an attitude (such as believing that it is snowing) —if and only if there is a possible process of sound or rational reasoning that could take you <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>current</b> state of mind to your rationally φ-ing. This approach is familiar in discussions of reasons for action. As Bernard Williams (1995, 35) put it, for there to be a reason for you to φ, there must be a “sound deliberative route ” that leads <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>current</b> state of mind to your being motivated to φ. Presumably, Williams’s reference to “a sound deliberative route ” comes to {{more or less the same}} thing as my own terminology of a “possible process of rational reasoning”. 1 It is clearly possible to take the same {{approach to}} understanding reasons for belief. You have a reason to believe p if and only if there is some possible process of rational reasoning that could lead you <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>current</b> state of mind to your being rationally inclined to believe p. So one way to make progress in understanding reasons for belief is to investigate whic...|$|R

Of course, the action suggested by the table might simply be, “Think about <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation</b> and decide what to do next. ” This method is, in many ways, represen-tative of the conventional approach to planning; however, what distin-guishes universal plans from con-ventional plans is that the action suggested by a universal plan is always a primitive one that the agent can execute immediately (Agr...|$|R

Where {{do you want to}} be professionally and personally in the next 5, 10, 20 years and what do you need to do to get there? It is important to determine how you would like to see your life and career develop, self-assess <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation</b> then develop a road map to get you there. Critical to your future success is a new found understanding of the positive correlation between relationships and results. Your roadmap’s first few steps are to create a vision, develop goals then perform a self-assessment and evaluate how well <b>your</b> <b>current</b> personal network will continue to support your future aspirations. After these few but critical steps are completed, you then can see which areas could be improved, possibly through training or some other development means. You may find in necessary to add resources to your personal network after your self-assessment is completed. It is important to create the right network of colleagues and friends that will support you. Finally, the importance of adopting a “pay it forward ” methodology may be the most important step.

In {{the first part of}} the project we briefly discuss water as necessary and vital to life, its use and treatment throughout history element and finally what is <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation</b> and future expectations. In the second part of the work will make a study, focused on the architectural level, of the water that is managed in buildings. On the one hand, we speak of the water entering a building; water supply from the network, and rainwater. On the other hand, we study the water resulting from the various activities that take place in the home. We will focus in features, quality and treatment, as well as the regulations that we can find in this area. In the third part of the work we will apply what has been previously investigated a multi-family building in Barcelona for improved management and water saving taking into account the particularities of this building type. First we carry out a study of existing water facilities and then we determine the water consumed in each home for each unit / activity, the water that can get to pick through rainwater harvesting, and finally the volume of water end generated by the building. With these data we will evaluate sustainable improvements to be gained in terms of water management...|$|R
40|$|Your resume {{provides}} {{a snapshot of}} your skills and experience for prospective employers. Ideally, it should also communicate your potential to perform well in the future. Typically, YOU ONLY HAVE THIRTY SECONDS to impress a recruiter or prospective employer with your resume. There {{are two types of}} resumes: the chronological resume and the functional resume. A chronological resume presents your employment history and experience in reverse chronological order under general headings or categories. A functional resume highlights the skills you have gained from past experiences, which are transferable to your desired career path. When compiling a functional resume, organize the information, especially the information in your “experience ” section, by job or skill function rather than chronologically.

40|$|People often “disconnect ” {{themselves}} from their personal health habits and financial practices. However, it’s hard to change behavior, to improve your health or increase your wealth, when you don’t fully acknowledge the problems with <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation.</b> Trying to make changes without an identified starting point is like making a plane reservation and not indicating the airport that you’re leaving from. You {{have to admit that}} you have a problem before you can take steps to address it. Denial is common with both health and personal finance issues, even when there’s ample visible evidence (e. g., a bulging waistline and increasing credit card balance) to the contrary. Several recent studies, for example, have found that many people said they were “healthy ” even though they were overweight, smoked, drank too much alcohol, and/or never exercised. Examples of financial denial (e. g., “other people will need long-term care, but I won’t ” and “I’ll be OK in retirement even though I haven’t saved any money yet”) have also been well documented. Awareness of one’s current behaviors and shortfalls is the first of the 5 A’s of successful behavior change. The other four are ability (being able to make a change), ambition (a strong desire to change), attitude (a positive state of mind about changing), and action (taking steps to actually change).

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. The City of Cape Town water {{services}} is currently {{operating on the}} reactive mode and their maintenance system is not effectively and efficiently utilized. The lack of proper utilization of Physical Asset Management (PAM) {{has resulted in the}} technical department failure to meet the departmental objectives of providing planned and scheduled maintenance activities, reducing equipment downtime and ensuring planned delivery of quality spares at the appropriate time. The aim of the report is to provide guidance in the implementation of physical assets management. The report looks at different maintenance strategies available and evaluates the current operating scenarios for the department and further recommends the relevant strategy that will suit the department. Physical asset management as a maintenance program provides an effective planned and scheduled maintenance system to reduce labor and downtime. This ensures that the correct materials and parts are utilized and that the workmanship is of a high quality. A Maintenance Plan provides documented and sequenced tasks with labour and types of material required to execute the plan. Infrastructure assets are systems that serve defined operational needs, where the intention is to maintain the asset for continual use on a certain level. One of the main aspects in infrastructure network is the degree of interdependency not only within a particular asset network but also among networks. The failure of one component within a network may undermine the performance of other networks. One of the major objectives in an infrastructure network is to maintain the necessary service level through continuous maintenance while ensuring cost effectiveness The initial step is to choose certain maintenance tactics and then decide how often these tactics will be performed. The frequency of maintenance, its actions or tactics depends on the current condition of the equipment which is linked within the technical characteristics of failure and specific monitoring technique. “Regardless of the system you select, you must start from where you are and then develop an orderly series of steps to get where you want to end up, so start by assessing <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation.</b> The most essential ingredient in your maintenance management system is the people. An excellent system run by poorly trained or unmotivated people will be adequate at best but well trained people with positive attitudes can make an excellent system world class. ”-Thomas Westerkam...|$|R
40|$|Regret is a {{negative}} emotion experienced upon the realisation that, had an alternative course of action been chosen, <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation</b> could have been improved. Psychologists and behavioural economists have long been interested in {{the extent to which}} both the anticipation and experience of this emotion can affect choice behaviour, when {{faced with the prospect of}} decision making under uncertainty and risk, where the resolution of uncertainty can have a significant effect on the degree to which an individual may regret the choice they ultimately decide to make. The literature in this area to date has principally focussed on the role of regret as an “anticipatory” emotion, whereby simply the fear of potentially regretting a course of action is sufficient to induce an individual to think twice about the decision they wish to make. More recently, however, the question has shifted to study the effects of the past “experience” of regret on subsequent decision making behaviour. This thesis both complements and challenges the existing literature in three ways. Firstly, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to introduce more realistic psychological assumptions, about the role of regret as an emotion, into a standard regret-based decision under uncertainty economic framework, and observes the patterns of behaviour which emerge when the mathematical formulation of regret is subject to the same biases and characteristics that we typically find with other emotions. Primarily, this concerns the degree to which an individual can learn about their future aversion towards regret from previous regretful experiences. Secondly, the small number of existing experiments, which aim to study the role of experienced regret on future choice, are challenged on the basis that their conclusions depend heavily on assumptions about the unobservable role regret plays in the mind of an individual. Indeed, the experimental results can be sensibly explained in a number of different ways such that opposite conclusions can be drawn. This problem is akin to the Identification Problem found in standard economics literature. Lastly, an experiment is designed and run which demonstrates that the extent to which the experience of regret affects future choice may be context dependent and population specific. The results show that we currently do not have a sufficiently strong theoretical understanding of how the anticipation of regret is connected to past choice in the mind of an individual...|$|R
5000|$|After Yuan Shao died in 202, Guo {{became a}} staff advisor to Yuan's eldest son, Yuan Tan. During the {{impending}} attack on Ji Province, after the defeat at Guandu, Guo Tu {{was sent to}} muster Yuan Tan's troops. Further on, {{as the leader of}} the Yuan family was being decided after Yuan Shao's death, Guo Tu was sent to talk to Yuan Tan's younger brother Yuan Shang, whom Yuan Shao had destined for succession. Yuan Shang had two advisors that were very crafty in their dealings, and it was Guo's idea to separate the two men as to make it easier for Yuan Tan to win over Yuan Shang's title. When Guo reached Yuan Shang, Yuan Shang gave Yuan Tan the title of General and ordered him to attack Cao Cao. Guo asked, since no men of Yuan Tan were fit to give advice, if Yuan Shang could send his two advisors to help. Yuan Shang could only but send one, whom Guo accompanied back to Yuan Tan. Upon reaching Yuan Tan, the advisor grew suspicious and retired to his chambers. He then entrusted a message to be brought to Yuan Shang saying, [...] "Guo Tu is very guilefull and is likely planning to harm you after Cao Cao is dealt with. Me being here is only to weaken <b>your</b> <b>current</b> <b>situation.</b> I advise letting Cao Cao do your work for you and withhold reinforcements." [...] He did so, but Yuan Tan found out of the ruse and killed his brother's advisor. News of this reached Yuan Shang and he began to worry of his brother's defection, in which case Cao would approach his city without opposition, so he marched to help his brother at once. They arrived and immediately was stricken with many defeats against Cao Cao. So Yuan Tan and Shang went on the defensive and Cao withdrew momentarily. Again suspicion arose between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang and Guo advised Yuan Tan set up a banquet for his brother's victory and assassinate him forthwith. The ruse was discovered by Yuan Shang, who brought five companies with him and besieged the city in which Yuan Tan resided. Guo, seeing defeat definite, advised surrendering to Cao, which Yuan Tan went about doing. Cao came with men and when he came upon the besieged city, Yuan Shang retreated back to Ji Province. Ji Province was besieged and Yuan Shang surrendered and was spared. Yuan Tan was to marry one of Cao's daughters and was sent to the capital, away from Guo.|$|R
