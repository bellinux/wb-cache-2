5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> mean anything so precise as that. However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So Fine with different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

60|$|Only {{in retrospect}} can I mark the almost {{imperceptible}} growth of my desire.

5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know how long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language {{which can be used}} not because of facilities and all that... but because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{have a high}} {{opinion of}} North American and their motives in the early days. Their first program manager was a {{first-class}} jerk....

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> think Europeans {{understand}} {{the implications of}} a systemic banking crisis....

Government intervention should be the first resort, not the last resort.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk about the things that I did {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record.

60|$|Perhaps it was {{the mystery}} which hung about her that kept her in my mind. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know where she was. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know how she fared. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know what sort of a man it was whom she had {{preferred}} to me. That, it struck me, was {{the crux of the}} matter. She had vanished absolutely with another man whom I had never seen and whose very name <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know. <b>I</b> had been beaten by an unseen foe.|$|R

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> greatly deceive myself, {{on the view}} that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E
