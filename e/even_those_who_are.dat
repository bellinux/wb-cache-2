The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> acclimatized. In serious cases, {{it can lead to}} high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E

[...] Soon afterwards he wrote [...] "It has already been said that when the State was established it held only six percent of the Jewish people remaining alive after the Nazi cataclysm. It must now be said that it has been established in only a portion of the Land of Israel. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> dubious as to the restoration of the historical frontiers, as fixed and crystallised and given from the beginning of time, will hardly deny the anomaly of the boundaries of the new State."

2500|$|The methods {{employed}} in CBT research {{have not been}} the only criticisms; some individuals have called its theory and therapy into question. For example, Fancher argues that CBT has failed to {{provide a framework for}} clear and correct thinking. He states that it is strange for CBT theorists to develop a framework for determining distorted thinking without ever developing a framework for [...] "cognitive clarity" [...] or what would count as [...] "healthy, normal thinking." [...] Additionally, he writes that irrational thinking cannot be a source of mental and emotional distress when {{there is no evidence of}} rational thinking causing psychological well-being. Or, that social psychology has proven the normal cognitive processes of the average person to be irrational, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> psychologically well. Fancher also says that the theory of CBT is inconsistent with basic principles and research of rationality, and even ignores many rules of logic. He argues that CBT makes something of thinking that is far less exciting and true than thinking probably is. Among his other arguments are the maintaining of the status quo promoted in CBT, the self-deception encouraged within clients and patients engaged in CBT, how poorly the research is conducted, and some of its basic tenets and norms: [...] "The basic norm of cognitive therapy is this: except for how the patient thinks, everything is ok".|$|E

2500|$|By 23 June, {{a larger}} battle {{south of the}} state capital, Wau town, broke out between SPLA and SPLM-IO, the latter {{claiming}} to fight {{in order to protect}} the local Fertit people from attacks by the Dinka-dominated SPLA. As result of the increasing violence, a state of emergency was declared in Wau town, and the SPLA's 5th Division moved in, officially to prevent further escalation of violence. These forces were under the command of Lt. Gen. Gabriel Jok Riak, who had been accused of human rights abuses by the United Nations during the South Sudanese Civil War. Governor Waya initially claimed to support the emergency declaration, stating [...] "All who are here are rebels, so the Division [...] SPLA is ready and <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> just walking around are ready". However, opposition groups claimed that the army soon began to plunder the state capital, and to assault the civilian population, leading Governor Waya to criticise the soldiers. Soon thereafter, on 24 June 2016, President Kiir unexpectedly sacked Waya, and just a few hours later, had him arrested. A local SPLA commander declared that Waya had been arrested because he was responsible for the deteriorating situation in the state, claiming that he had no respect for the military and talked [...] "nonsense". A few days later, a document began to circulate on the internet that claimed that Lt. Gen. Mangar Buong Aluenge of the SPLA had plotted from the very beginning to remove and arrest Waya, while the Society for Threatened Peoples believed that Waya's criticism of the army had led to his arrest.|$|E
2500|$|... "When he {{had been}} consecrated eight years the Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadasi Ashoka conquered Kalinga. A hundred and fifty {{thousand}} people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and many times that number perished. Afterwards, now that Kalinga was annexed, the Beloved of the Gods very earnestly practised [...] "Dhamma", desired [...] "Dhamma". On conquering Kalinga the Beloved of the Gods felt remorse, for, when an independent country is conquered the slaughter, death, and deportation of people in extremely grievous to the Beloved of the Gods, and weighs heavily on his mind. What is even more deplorable to the Beloved to the Gods is that those who dwell there, whether Brahmans, Sarmanas, or those of other sects, or householders who show obedience to their superiors, obedience to their mother and father, obedience to their teachers and behave well and devotedly to their friends, acquiescence, colleagues, relatives, slaves and servants—all suffer violence, murder and separation from their loved ones. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> fortunate to have escaped, and whose love is undiminished (by the brutalizing effect of war), suffer from the misfortunes of their friends, acquaintances colleagues and relatives. This participation of all men in suffering weighs heavily on the mind of Beloved of the Gods. Except among the Greeks, there is no land where religious orders of Brahmans and Sarmanas {{are not to be}} found, and there is no land anywhere where men do not support one sect or another. Today, if a hundredth or thousandth part of those people who were killed or died or were deported when Kalinga was annexed were to suffer similarly, it would weighs heavily on the mind of the Beloved of the Gods." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{critical}} reviews {{show the}} album remains highly regarded. Allmusic said [...] "Their rhythms {{may have been}} reggae-based, their music Jamaican-inspired, but UB40 had such an original take on the genre that all comparisons were moot... Their music was... revolutionary, their sound unlike anything else on either island ... It's hard to {{believe this is the}} same UB40 that later topped the U.K. charts with the likes of 'Red Red Wine' and 'I Got You Babe'. Their fire was dampened quickly, but on Signing Off it blazed high, still accessible to the pop market, but so edgy that <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sure there's nothing about the group to admire will change their tune instantly." [...] In 2008 Mojo magazine's online website revisited the album as part of their [...] "Disc of the Day" [...] series, calling it [...] "the Brum reggae institution's original and best" [...] and going on to say that [...] "Signing Off was a singular British take on Jamaican music, in some ways truer to the reggae source than 2-Tone but with a punky, multi-cultured sensibility of its own... it's a superb balance of lightness and weight, as spry, skanking tunes rub up against militant lyrics made soulful by vocalist Ali Campbell." [...] The print edition of the magazine also reviewed the 2010 reissue, stating that [...] "Signing Off... has retained much of its fire... this is flinty, political and Britain-focused reggae, distinct from the later output of a band that... still acts as the form's global ambassadors." [...] Reviewing the 2010 Collector's Edition, BBC Music said [...] "Signing Off is still believed {{by many to be the}} group's greatest album, and it remains the clearest window into what the band were all about... has energy and intelligence that made it stand out from so much post-punk pop. This set sums up a bunch of young Brummies schooled in the West Indian blues dances of Balsall Heath, angry about the world around them and articulate enough to express that without simply ranting." ...|$|E
