Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

[...] In addition to his three remaining children, he was survived by ten grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. President Obama paid tribute to him as [...] "a champion for peace" [...] and a [...] "statesman of great conscience and conviction".

The province's educational minister, Madelaine Dubé, said: [...] "It is good to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> schools can also contribute to protecting our environment." [...] The school held its inauguration ceremony with Bernard Lord present on September 30, 2005, despite its delayed opening {{a few days after}} the beginning of the 200506 school year. Lord spoke of his government's intention to add schools to the growing number of Francophone institutions in New Brunswick, as well as advancing the state of the province's education.

[...] "Parents, students and teaching staff now have modern, state of the art facilities. I feel very proud about this project and I am delighted that it is now a reality."

500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E
500|$|Since {{moving to}} digital {{multichannel}} Eleven, Neighbours has traditionally rated between 250,000 and 350,000 viewers. The show attracted 254,000 viewers {{for its first}} episode broadcast on 11 January 2011. This was half the number of viewers that watched it on Network Ten; the Herald Sun reported {{that it was a}} good result as [...] "bosses were only expecting 133,000." [...] Neighbours became Eleven's most-watched show and the third highest rating show on digital multichannels that night. Programming chief, David Mott stated [...] "Last night's strong result for Neighbours already suggests the audience will follow the folks from Ramsay Street to their brand new neighbourhood on Eleven." [...] On 24 January 2011, Neighbours achieved 330,000 viewers and three days later 355,000 viewers tuned in, becoming the show's highest rating yet on Eleven at the time. The show had more viewers than the Ten Evening News in the 16–39 and 18–49 demographic. On 13 June 2011, Neighbours was watched by 455,000 viewers, making it the highest rating show on digital multichannels that night and breaking its previous ratings record on the channel. On 27 May 2013, episode 6651 of Neighbours was watched by an audience of 405,000 viewers, which was the highest rating the series had achieved in nearly two years. Neighbours began going through a ratings decline in 2016, with episodes now averaging below 200,000 viewers.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} appears {{when there}} is no natural choice of elements from each set. [...] If we cannot make explicit choices, how do we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> set exists? [...] For example, suppose that X is the set of all non-empty subsets of the real numbers. [...] First we might try to proceed as if X were finite. [...] If we try to choose an element from each set, then, because X is infinite, our choice procedure will never come to an end, and consequently, we shall never be able to produce a choice function for all of X. [...] Next we might try specifying the least element from each set. [...] But some subsets of the real numbers do not have least elements. For example, the open interval (0,1) does not have a least element: if x is in (0,1), then so is x/2, and x/2 is always strictly smaller than x. [...] So this attempt also fails.|$|E
