30|$|However, {{the drying}} {{shrinkage}} of mortars reduces significantly {{by increasing the}} <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> dosage. When 100 % calcareous gravel is replaced by waste glass, the shrinkage of the corresponding mortar becomes less than one-third of that of the reference mortar (0 %). This {{is due to the}} higher modulus of elasticity of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> compared to that of calcareous gravel. Again, the silane addition does not change significantly the behaviour of mortars.|$|R
30|$|As expected, due to {{the lower}} {{porosity}} of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets,</b> increasing the replacing of gravel gives a slight reduction in water loss with time, regardless {{of the presence of}} silane.|$|R
40|$|Combining {{the use of}} photocatalysts with {{cementitious}} {{materials is}} an important development {{in the field of}} photocatalytic air pollution mitigation. This paper presents the results of a systematic study on assessing the effectiveness of pollutant degradation by concrete surface layers that incorporate a photocatalytic material - Titanium Dioxide. The photocatalytic activity of the concrete samples was determined by photocatalytic oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) in the laboratory. Recycled <b>glass</b> <b>cullets,</b> derived from crushed waste beverage bottles, were used to replace sand in preparing the concrete surface layers. Factors, which may affect the pollutant removal performance of the concrete layers including glass color, aggregate size and curing age, were investigated. The results show a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity due to the use of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> as aggregates in the concrete layers. The samples fabricated with clear <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> exhibited threefold NO removal efficiency compared to the samples fabricated with river sand. The light transmittance property of glass was postulated to account for the efficiency improvement, which was confirmed by a separate simulation study. But the influence of the size of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> was not evident. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of concrete surface layers decreased with curing age, showing a loss of 20 % photocatalytic activity after 56 -day curing.

40|$|Rheological {{behaviour}} {{of fresh}} mortars {{is a key}} characteristic since it determines workability, compaction and segregation properties of the material and greatly influences the final characteristics of the hardened product. Substituting Portland cement with pulverised lamp glass waste (incandescent light bulb borosilicate <b>glass</b> waste <b>cullet</b> and fluorescent lamp tube <b>glass</b> waste <b>cullet)</b> in concrete has {{a significant effect on}} its workability and strength. Present study evaluates the effectiveness of lamp <b>glass</b> waste <b>cullet</b> at a level of 30 % as cement component in mortar and determines the grinding time for optimal physical and mechanical properties of mortars. Viscosity, electrical conductivity, ultrasound pulse velocity and compressive strength of such cement mortars were determined. The results showed that the finer the incandescent light bulb borosilicate <b>glass</b> waste <b>cullet</b> powder particles were, the lower were the viscosity, ultrasound pulse velocity and electrical conductivity. However, the finer the fluorescent lamp tube <b>glass</b> waste <b>cullet</b> powder particles were, the higher were the viscosity and electrical conductivity.

30|$|Moreover, due to {{the lower}} density of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> (2.5  g/cm 3) {{compared}} to calcareous gravel (2.65  g/cm 3), the replacing in volume gives a slight decrease of density in the hardened compound (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|The {{possibility}} of recycling mixed colour waste glass {{as it is}} for manufacturing decorative architectural mortars, has been investigated. In mortars, the 0 – 33 – 66 – 100 % of calcareous gravel volume has been replaced with recycled <b>glass</b> <b>cullets,</b> with no other inorganic addition. To mitigate the possible alkali–silica reaction, mixes with a hydrophobic admixture were also compared. The obtained results show that the replacement of calcareous gravel with <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> of similar grain size distribution permits to reduce the dosage of the superplasticizer admixture to obtain the same workability of fresh mortar; it does not affect significantly the mechanical performances, the water vapour permeability and the capillary water absorption but it reduces significantly the drying shrinkage deformation. The used recycled glass is classified as no reactive in terms of alkali–silica reaction neither in water nor in NaOH solution following the parameters of the current normative, {{even in the absence of}} the hydrophobic admixture. The hydrophobic admixture further delays the expansion trigger but not the speed of its propagation.|$|R
50|$|Since 1927, the Beer Store has {{refunded}} deposits on all empty beer containers {{purchased in}} Ontario. In February 2007 the Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP) was {{launched by the}} Government of Ontario. The ODRP’s goal {{is to ensure that}} 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled. All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario’s waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher-end recycling supporting Ontario’s green economy and generating environmental benefits. “This success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,” said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement. As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality <b>glass</b> <b>cullet</b> for Ontario glass manufacturing - previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source <b>glass</b> <b>cullet</b> from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013-2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads. Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil).|$|E
50|$|Goff's {{accumulated}} design {{portfolio of}} 500 projects (about {{one quarter of}} them built) demonstrates a restless, sped-up evolution through conventional styles and forms at a young age, through the Prairie Style of his heroes and correspondents Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan, then into original design. Finding inspiration in sources as varied as Antoni Gaudi, Balinese music, Claude Debussy, Japanese ukiyo-e prints, and seashells, Goff's mature work had no precedent and he has few heirs other than his former assistant, New Mexico architect Bart Prince, and former student, Herb Greene. His contemporaries primarily followed tight functionalistic floorplans with flat roofs and no ornament. Goff's idiosyncratic floorplans, attention to spatial effect, and use of recycled and/or unconventional materials such as gilded zebrawood, cellophane strips, cake pans, <b>glass</b> <b>cullet,</b> Quonset Hut ribs, ashtrays, and white turkey feathers, challenge conventional distinctions between order and disorder.|$|E
50|$|Islamic {{glass from}} this period has been given {{relatively}} little attention by scholars. One exception to this was the work carried out by Carl J. Lamm (1902-1987). Lamm catalogued and classified the glass finds from important Islamic sites; for example Susa in Iran (Lamm 1931), and at Samarra in Iraq (Lamm 1928). One {{of the most important}} discoveries in the field of Islamic glass was a shipwreck dated to around 1036 AD on the Turkey coast at Serçe Liman. The recovered cargo included vessel fragments and <b>glass</b> <b>cullet</b> exported from Syria. The significance of these finds lies in the information they can tell us about the production and distribution of Islamic glass. Despite this, the majority of studies have concentrated on stylistic and decorative classification (Carboni 2001; Kröger 1995; Lamm 1928; Lamm 1931; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001), and as such technological aspects of the industry, as well as undecorated vessels and objects, have often been overlooked within the field. This, in particular, is frustrating because the majority of glass finds during the Islamic period are undecorated and used for utilitarian purposes.|$|E
30|$|The glass sample came {{directly}} from a waste management system of hollow glass as it is, just to test a mix of very different waste glasses without additional expensive treatments. In particular, the effect of replacing calcareous gravel volume with increased dosages of <b>glass</b> <b>cullets</b> on the workability, mechanical behaviour, in terms of bending and compression tests, water vapour permeability, and durability, in terms of capillary water absorption, shrinkage and alkali–silica reaction, has been investigated.|$|R

5000|$|The {{situation}} is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul - however the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry {{have yet to be}} located. These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern Europe and inferred for Italy. [...] Evidence for large scale production has only come the Eastern Mediterranean and from latter dates and assumes a continuing glass making tradition. That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck - 3rd century - carrying 8 tons of raw glass. [...] This however does not exclude the smaller scale local production reported elsewhere. The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo <b>glass</b> <b>cullet</b> presumably for recycling. [...] Trace element analysis of colourless glass showed these were made using sands from different sources and giving some support to the de-centralised production hypothesis.|$|E
5000|$|The use of VSI crushers {{in large}} scale {{operations}} allow {{the production of}} up to 125 tons per hour [...] of crushed <b>glass</b> <b>cullet.</b> VSI Crushers use a high speed rotor with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle particles. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of fiberglass, ceramic ware, flux agents and abrasives. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower wear part lives.|$|E
