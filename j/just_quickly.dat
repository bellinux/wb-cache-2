30|$|For {{annotated}} and animated examples, {{the amount}} of work with examples could be counted as the number of accesses to examples and the “depth” of access, which is critical for “instructional” content. To see whether these two aspects should be treated separately, we looked at the correlation between the number of examples viewed (access to examples) and the number of example lines viewed (depth of access), and we found that the correlation was very high for both the annotated examples and animated examples (ρ= 0.98, p< 0.0001). Additionally, to make sure that students worked with examples and did not <b>just</b> <b>quickly</b> click through the example lines without reading the annotations or reflecting on what the example visualized, we looked at the correlation between the number of examples viewed and {{the amount of}} time students spent on working with the examples. Again, we found the correlation to be very high for each example type (annotated examples: ρ= 0.82, p< 0.0001; animated examples: ρ= 0.92, p< 0.0001). This suggests that when accessing examples, students worked with them and did not just click through them. As a result, one of the measures of the work with examples is sufficient for later analysis; we selected the number of accesses.|$|E
40|$|We've {{known for}} a long time, both from real-life {{language}} use and laboratory experiments, that utterance comprehension is incremental. In my talk, I will use ERP data to illustrate just how pervasive this incrementality really is. Readers and listeners grab every word as it comes in, and relate it to the wider discourse context (e. g., what has been said before, the identity of the speaker) in a split second, in terms of its semantic, referential and syntactic implications. Listeners also relate words that are unintentionally embedded in other words (e. g., "pain" in "champagne") to the preceding context. All this reveals that we are dealing with a rather eager information processing system, one that doesn't hesitate to commit early. After reviewing ERP evidence for incrementality, I will briefly discuss two lines of research that go beyond standard incrementality. First, we have converging evidence to suggest that people don't <b>just</b> <b>quickly</b> act upon bits of the unfolding input [...] they also look ahead, and anticipate upcoming words, referents and concepts. Second, we have initial evidence that, at least {{in the context of an}} attitude survey, people rapidly relate the unfolding utterance to their personal value system. Of course, all this makes sense if we consider language in the bigger picture of biological life, where anticipation can prevent you from getting killed, and where rapid valuation may well be the prime motivator for incremental processin...|$|E
40|$|Inspired on {{the well}} known {{dynamical}} dichotomy predicted in voids, where some underdense regions expand whereas others collapse due to overdense surrounding regions, we explored {{the interplay between}} the void inner dynamics and its large scale environment. The environment is classified depending on its density as in previous works. We analyse the dynamical properties of void-centered spherical shells at different void-centric distances depending on this classification. The above dynamical properties are given by the angular distribution of the radial velocity field, its smoothness, the field dependence on the tracer density and shape, and the field departures from linear theory. We found that the velocity field in expanding voids follows more closely the linear prediction, with a more smooth velocity field. However when using velocity tracers with large densities such deviations increase. Voids with sizes around 18 h^- 1 Mpc are in a transition regime between regions with expansion overpredicted and underpredicted from linear theory. We also found that velocity smoothness increases as the void radius, indicating the laminar flow dominates the expansion of larger voids (more than 18 h^- 1 Mpc). The correlations observed suggest that nonlinear dynamics of the inner regions of voids could be dependent {{on the evolution of}} the surrounding structures. These also indicate possible scale couplings between the void inner expansion and the large scale regions where voids are embedded. These results shed some light to the origin of nonlinearities in voids, going beyond the fact that voids <b>just</b> <b>quickly</b> becomes nonlinear as they become emptier.

30|$|Other {{differences}} between the confidence-weighted multiple-choice format and the standard multiple-choice format exist as well, however, and could possibly also contribute, {{at least to some}} degree, to the greater benefit for retention of untested related information observed with this testing format in the present experiments. For example, the inclusion of a Don’t know option in the confidence-weighted format, used in both the present research and in Bruno’s (1989, 1993) original format, might {{play a role in the}} production of this benefit. Although this option was selected only 8.7  % of the time across both of the present experiments, and thus its availability seems unlikely to have been a major factor affecting the observed pattern of results, it is nonetheless possible that just its presence as a response option could have impacted the type of processing in which participants engaged when taking such multiple-choice tests. We speculate, however, that, rather than increasing participants’ engagement in the type of productive retrieval processes we believe to underlie the benefit for retention of related information observed by Little et al. (2012) and in the present research, its presence may have been counteractive. Perhaps, for example, the presence of a Don’t know option acts something like a bailout option for when test-takers immediately think they do not know the answer. They can <b>just</b> <b>quickly</b> select it rather than being forced to think about their confidence in each alternative relative to the others. In short, the presence of a Don’t know option might occasionally rob test-takers of the opportunity to strengthen what they know via a critical evaluation of all the information they can retrieve regarding each of the alternatives.|$|E
40|$|For {{many people}} in ACP countries, {{particularly}} those living in remote rural areas, non-existent or poor and expensive Internet connections are a daily reality. But that doesn´t {{mean you have to}} go without all the vital information on the World Wide Web. There is a simple but little known solution to common connectivity problems: web-to-email. Web-to-email is a technology that allows anyone to receive web pages by email. If you are not able to surf the web, but are able to receive email, web-to-email is an effective way to still have access to all the resources on the Internet. And if you do have access to the web, using web-to-email will save you time and money. You don´t have to worry about slow connections or per minute dial-up charges trying to download web pages?you <b>just</b> <b>quickly</b> check your email. You may have wondered why the printed version of ICT Update includes the web addresses of all the projects, documents and organizations it mentions. The reason is that we want to promote the use of web-to-email to enable you to retrieve dozens of relevant online files, a minimum investment in terms of time, effort and money. How does it work? Web-to-email technology uses servers that fetch documents from the web, and send them to you as email messages, either in plain text or HTML. To use the system, simply send an email message addressed to one of the web-to-email servers listed below. Leave the subject line blank. In the body of the email message, type the web address of the page you want to read. In the following example, the message is addressed to www 4 mail@kabissa. org, a web-to-email server run by Kabissa. org" / Kabissa. The page requested is ICT Update´s homepage, [URL] Your email message should look like this: [...] - TO: www 4 mail@kabissa. org CC: BCC: SUBJECT: [...] - GET [URL] [...] - Simply replace [URL] with the address of the web page you want to read.
