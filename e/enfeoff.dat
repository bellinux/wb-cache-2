25|$|When Deng Ai besieged Zhuge Zhan at Mianzhu Pass, {{he offered}} the latter {{a chance to}} {{surrender}} and promised to recommend to the Wei government to <b>enfeoff</b> Zhuge Zhan as the Prince of Langye if he surrendered. However, Zhuge Zhan refused, had Deng Ai's messenger executed, and ordered his troops to prepare for battle outside the pass. He supposedly arranged his troops in the Eight Trigrams Formation invented by his father. At the time, there were other notable Shu figures with Zhuge Zhan at Mianzhu Pass, including Zhang Zun (張遵; a grandson of Zhang Fei), Li Qiu (李球; an imperial guard commander), Huang Chong, as well as Zhuge Zhan's eldest son Zhuge Shang. After Huang Chong gave {{a speech to the}} Shu soldiers to boost their morale, both sides engaged in battle. Deng Ai ordered his son Deng Zhong (鄧忠) and another officer Shi Zuan (師纂) to flank Zhuge Zhan's position. They moved to the formation's left and right but the Shu forces intercepted them and drove them back; only Deng Ai's central force remained intact. When Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan complained {{that there was no way}} to break the formation and suggested that they retreat, Deng Ai angrily said that they must win if they wanted to live another day, and even threatened to execute anyone who spoke of retreat. Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan then led their men to attack the Shu formation again and succeeded in breaking it. Zhuge Zhan, Zhuge Shang, Zhang Zun, Li Qiu, Huang Chong and other Shu officers were killed in action.|$|E
25|$|Brandenburg and Neuburg {{viewed the}} regency {{as a direct}} attempt at annexing the duchy. On 10 June 1609, they signed the , rejecting all other claimants and {{establishing}} a provisional government together with the local estates. Their troops entered the duchy in defiance to the acting regency and the Emperor. In January 1610, Henry IV of France signed a draft military pact with the Protestant Union, dispatching 22,000 men under Marshal de La Chatre to north–east France. A comparable number of troops was dispatched by the Dutch towards Schenkenschanz, in an apparent show of force towards Spain. Archduke Leopold V sought to raise his profile in the ongoing power struggle between the Emperor and Archduke Matthias by convincing the former to annul the Treaty of Dortmund and appoint him as the imperial commissioner. Leopold triumphantly entered Jülich, however he soon found himself besieged by an army three times his size, as fighting spread to Aachen and Düren. The struggle between the Catholic royal family and the Protestant princes brought fears of a larger religious war. The Protestant Union mobilized 5,000 men, while Leopold recruited 1,000 cavalry and 3,000 infantry in the Prince-Bishopric of Strasbourg. His Habsburg relatives {{and the rest of}} the Catholic League refused to openly support Leopold, only gathering troops for their own protection. On 13 March 1610, the Protestant count Otto von Solms–Braunfels invaded Strasbourg with 2,000 troops. The Catholics simply retreated into walled towns such as Saverne, waiting until the ill–disciplined invaders ran out of money and retreated. A meeting was set in Prague on 1 May 1610, in order to broker a settlement. Rudolf's initial decision to <b>enfeoff</b> the entire duchy to Christian II, Elector of Saxony was rejected by a number of moderate princes, leading to postpone further negotiations until August.|$|E
2500|$|After Zhong Hui {{returned}} to Luoyang, the Wei imperial court offered him {{the position of}} Minister Coachman (太僕), but he turned down the offer and chose to be a clerk in Sima Zhao's office. He was one of Sima Zhao's close aides. Later, the imperial court wanted to <b>enfeoff</b> him as the [...] "Marquis of Chen" [...] (陳侯) to honour him for his contributions in suppressing Zhuge Dan's rebellion, but he declined to accept the marquis title. The court respected his decision and appointed him as the Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉) instead. Zhong Hui was still heavily involved in politics in the imperial court {{even though he did}} not serve in the court. He also {{played a major role in}} instigating Sima Zhao to execute Ji Kang.|$|E

50|$|In 1272 the Prioress of Lingebrook {{was summoned}} to answer the coheirs of Walter Muscegros as to why she blocked their {{redemption}} of tenements in Bodenham under the Dictum of Kenilworth.

The Prioress claimed that Muscegros had <b>enfeoffed</b> John L’Estrange, who <b>enfeoffed</b> Walter Devereux, who <b>enfeoffed</b> Nicholas Duredent, who <b>enfeoffed</b> Master John de Croft, and Croft granted the same to the Prioress in frankalmoin.

2500|$|In 626, Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, who {{had been}} in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng the crown prince, ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, the Prince of Qi, at Xuanwu Gate. He then [...] forced Emperor Gaozu to first <b>enfeoff</b> him as crown prince and then abdicate the throne, leaving it open for Li Shimin to take the throne as Emperor Taizong. [...] After Taizong ascended to power in 628, Ashina Tong was killed by his uncle, Ashina Moheduo, who seized the throne as Qulipiqie Khan. [...] However, some key Turks {{supported}} Ashina Tong's son Ashina Dieli as khan. Both sought aid and marriages from Tang China, and Emperor Taizong declined both. Eventually, in 630, Ashina Dieli was able to defeat and kill Ashina Moheduo, again reuniting the Western Turkic Khaganate. [...] Meanwhile, Gaochang's king Qu Wentai made a visit to Chang'an in 630, and was received warmly by the Tang court.|$|E
2500|$|In 211, after Cao Cao's son Cao Pi was {{appointed}} as General of the Household for All Purposes (五官中郎將) in the Han central government, Liang Mao first served as his Chief Clerk (長史) {{and later as}} his Left Military Adviser (左軍師). In 213, when Emperor Xian, the figurehead Han emperor, wanted to <b>enfeoff</b> Cao Cao as the Duke of Wei (魏公), Cao Cao initially declined but relented after Liang Mao and several others urged him to accept. Liang Mao served as Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射) and later as zhongwei fengchang (中尉奉常) in Cao Cao's dukedom. In 216, Emperor Xian elevated Cao Cao from {{the status of a}} duke to a vassal king under the title [...] "King of Wei" [...] (魏王). A year later, after Cao Cao designated Cao Pi as the heir apparent to his vassal kingdom, he appointed Liang Mao as the Crown Prince's Grand Tutor (太子太傅). Cao Pi treated Liang Mao respectfully and courteously. Liang Mao died in office in an unknown year, but most probably before 220.|$|E

50|$|The {{constitution}} of the Holy Roman Empire provided, that the Emperor may only <b>enfeoff</b> a prince-bishop elect with the regalia, if the Pope would have confirmed his election to the respective See. In default thereof the Emperor could grant a liege indult (Lehnsindult), often restricted to some years only, and then notwithstanding <b>enfeoff</b> the prince-bishop elect with the regalia of restricted legitimacy {{to the effect that}} the elect could rule with princely power within the prince-bishopric, bearing only title of Administrator, but would be banned from participating in the Diets.
