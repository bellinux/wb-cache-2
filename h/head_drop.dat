6000|$|The heart-broken sister let her <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> faintly. [...] "So Hilda told me," [...] she murmured; [...] "and what Hilda says {{in these}} matters is almost always final." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Beam let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on his breast, {{his arms}} hung down by his side, and he sank into his chair, {{as if his}} spine had come unhinged.|$|E
6000|$|Alice Deringham let her <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> {{back on her}} father's {{shoulder}} with a little sigh. [...] "It seems a very long way," [...] she said, [...] "and I am very cold." ...|$|E
60|$|He sighed heavily; his <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{again on}} his breast--he left me.|$|R
60|$|Mulvaney's <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{upon his}} chest, {{and we thought}} that he was asleep.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} heavy {{arms on the}} table; his <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> on them--he slept.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{am not a}} fortune-teller," [...] he said, {{letting his}} <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> into a festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. [...] "You know what I am, don't you? Good night, Pip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so. I thought so. And I {{sent him}} back for confirmatory evidence. But the rogue has never brought it." [...] He let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on his rude pillow heavily. [...] "Never, never brought it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl saw Ruth's <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> an inch, and {{her eyes}} close to a slit as she {{inspected}} him with sudden surprise. He knew that it had just occurred to her who he was. Their eyes exchanged understanding. [...] "She does get things," [...] he thought, and said, lightly: ...|$|E

60|$|The Captain's <b>head</b> <b>dropped,</b> {{his elbow}} relaxed, and he {{returned}} to the land of Nod for another half-hour.|$|R
6000|$|Why did her <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> heavily {{upon his}} shoulder? He turned--a dark stream of blood was flowing from her lips! He sprang to his feet. The girls rushed in. They tore open her shawl, {{and saw the}} ghastly wound, which she had hidden with such iron {{resolution}} to the last. But it was too late. Miriam the daughter of Solomon was gone to her own place. ...............|$|E
60|$|Barbara began rather weakly, but {{her voice}} {{gathered}} strength, and then poured full volume to the end, where it weakened again. He {{knew that she was}} taking refuge from him in the song, and in the magic of her voice he escaped from the disappointment he had been suffering. He let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> and his eyelids fall, and in the rapture of her singing he got back what he had lost; or rather, he lost himself again to the illusion which had grown so precious to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} seen a comrade {{poisoned}} by the bushmen--when they meant to hurt him? No! Then you have something to be thankful for. Lyle, by worse luck, was young and strong, and took an unconscionable time dying; I don't know that I did well when I took the pistol from him. For three mortal hours I suffered all with him, and there was no power left in me when at last he let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on the table. There are things it is not fit to remember which one can never forget. Then I knew all that the man had been to me; and what I must do was plain before me.|$|E
60|$|Brother John's <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{upon his}} chest, {{and his eyes}} shut {{as though he had}} gone to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Already Nostromo {{was walking}} slowly, his <b>head</b> <b>dropping,</b> as if checked in his pace by the weariness of irresolution.|$|R

6000|$|Gillian, half distracted {{with fear}} and wonder, heaped exclamations on {{questions}}, and mingled questions with cries for help, till Rose sternly rebuked her in a tone which seemed to recall her scattered senses. She became then composed enough to fetch a lamp which remained lighted in the room she had left, and to render herself at least partly useful in suggesting and applying the usual modes for recalling the suspended sense. In this they at length succeeded, for Eveline fetched a fuller sigh, and opened her eyes; but presently shut them again, and letting her <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on Rose's bosom, fell into a strong shuddering fit; while her faithful damsel, chafing her hands and her temples alternately with affectionate assiduity, and mingling caresses with these efforts, exclaimed aloud, [...] "She lives!--She is recovering!--Praised be God!" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} mind to {{locomotion}} in this new body in which he found himself. For a time {{he was unable to}} shift himself from his attachment to his earthly carcass. For a time this new strange cloud body of his simply swayed, contracted, expanded, coiled, and writhed with his efforts to free himself, and then quite suddenly the link that bound him snapped. For a moment everything was hidden by what appeared to be whirling spheres of dark vapour, and then through a momentary gap he saw his drooping body collapse limply, saw his lifeless <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> sideways, and found he was driving along like a huge cloud in a strange place of shadowy clouds that had the luminous intricacy of London spread like a model below.|$|E
60|$|Arthur let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on his hand, {{helpless}} and overcome, as this little matter brought home {{the sense of}} missing his wife, and the remembrance of the attentions he had allowed her to lavish upon him. His brother tried the tea-chest, and, finding it locked, poured out some coffee, which he drank almost unconsciously, then gave his cup for more, sighed, pushed his hair back, and looked up somewhat revived. John tended him affectionately, persuading him to take food; {{and when he had}} passively allowed his plate to be filled, his appetite discovered that he had tasted nothing since yesterday morning, and therewith his spirits were refreshed; he looked up cheerfully, and there was less despondency in his tone as he spoke of her sleep towards morning having been less disturbed.|$|E
60|$|Ciccio {{hung back}} against the door, his <b>head</b> <b>dropped,</b> and the shy, suspicious, faintly {{malicious}} smile on his face.|$|R
60|$|She sank {{lower on}} the flowers, and her <b>head</b> <b>dropped.</b> But {{she would not be}} beaten. She lifted her face.|$|R
60|$|He {{waited and}} waited; his <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{forward in a}} sort of sleep. Suddenly he started awake. The back of his head hurt severely.|$|R
6000|$|Armine {{knew there}} was no chance of an {{immediate}} and entire recovery for him, and this was a severe stroke to Babie, who was quite unprepared. And, as her face began to draw up with tears near the surface, he hugged her close, and consolingly whispered that now they would be together always, he should not have to go away from his own dear Babie Bunting, and there was a little kissing match, ending by Babie saying, disconsolately, [...] "But you did like Eton so, and {{you were going to get}} the Newcastle and the Prince Consort's prize, and to be in the eleven and all—-and you were so sure of a high remove! Oh, dear!" [...] and she let her <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on his shoulder, and was almost crying again.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, Mellish {{had been}} dragged {{from beneath the}} train and seated on the knee {{of one of his}} companions. He was in a stupor, and had a large lump on his brow. His eye was almost closed. The man with the crushed nose now showed himself an expert surgeon. While Cashel {{supported}} the patient on the knee of another man, {{and the rest of the}} party kept off the crowd by mingled persuasion and violence, he produced a lancet and summarily reduced the swelling by lancing it. He then dressed the puncture neatly with appliances for that purpose which he carried about him, and shouted in Mellish's ear to rouse him. But the trainer only groaned, and let his <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> inert on his breast. More shouting was resorted to, but in vain. Cashel impatiently expressed an opinion that Mellish was shamming, and declared that he would not stand there to be fooled with all the evening.|$|E
60|$|Sophy {{could hold}} out no longer, {{she let her}} <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> on the kind shoulder, and seemed to collapse, with burning brow, {{throbbing}} pulses, and sobs as deep and convulsive as had been those of her little brother. Hastily calling Lucy, who was frightened, subdued, and helpful, Albinia undressed the poor child, put her to bed, and applied lily leaves and spirits to her arm. The smart seemed to refresh her, {{but there had been}} a violent strain, as well as bruise, and each touch visibly gave severe pain, though she never complained. Lucy insisted on hearing exactly how the accident had happened, and pressed her with questions, which Albinia would have shunned in her present condition, and it was thus elicited that she had taken Maurice across the street to how him to Mrs. Osborn. He had resented the strange place, and strange people, and had cried so much that she was obliged to run home with him at once. A knot of bawling men came reeling {{out of one of the}} many beer shops in Tibbs's Alley, and in her haste to avoid them, she tripped, close to the gate-post of Willow Lawn, and fell, with only time to interpose her arm between Maurice's head and the sharp corner. She was lifted up at once, in the horror of seeing him neither cry nor move, for, in fact, he had been almost stifled under her weight, and all had since been to her a frightful phantom dream. Albinia was infinitely relieved by this history, showing that Maurice could hardly have received any real injury, and in her declarations that Sophy's presence of mind had saved him, was forgetting to whom the accident was owing. Lucy wanted to know why her sister could have taken him out of the house at all, but Albinia could not bear to have this pressed at such a moment, and sent the inquirer down to order some tea, which she shared with Sophy, and then was forced to bid her good-night, without drawing out any further confessions. But when the girl raised herself to receive her kiss, it was the first real embrace that had passed between them.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{into its}} former {{position}} on my bosom, and she murmured a few words, but too faintly {{for me to}} hear them.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs Verloc’s <b>head</b> <b>dropped.</b> “Nothing. He did nothing. He went away. The {{police were}} on that man’s side,” she murmured tragically. “Another one came too.” ...|$|R
60|$|His <b>head</b> <b>dropped</b> {{back upon}} his pillow. He was white to the lips. Winifred hurried to his side. Once more she turned upon the two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having {{completed}} my preparations, I imparted to the avuncular pendulum {{a gentle}} oscillation, and retiring to cover behind a contiguous rock, lifted up my voice {{in a long}} rasping cry whose diminishing final note was drowned in a noise {{like that of a}} swearing cat, which emanated from the sack. Instantly that formidable sheep was upon its feet and had taken in the military situation at a glance. In a few moments it had approached, stamping, to within fifty yards of the swinging foeman, who, now retreating and anon advancing, seemed to invite the fray. Suddenly I saw the beast's <b>head</b> <b>drop</b> earthward as if depressed by the weight of its enormous horns; then a dim, white, wavy streak of sheep prolonged itself from that spot in a generally horizontal direction to within about four yards of a point immediately beneath the enemy. There it struck sharply upward, and before it had faded from my gaze at the place whence it had set out I heard a horrid thump and a piercing scream, and my poor uncle shot forward, with a slack rope higher than the limb to which he was attached. Here the rope tautened with a jerk, arresting his flight, and back he swung in a breathless curve {{to the other end of}} his arc. The ram had fallen, a heap of indistinguishable legs, wool and horns, but pulling itself together and dodging as its antagonist swept downward it retired at random, alternately shaking its head and stamping its fore-feet. When it had backed about the same distance as that from which it had delivered the assault it paused again, bowed its head as if in prayer for victory and again shot forward, dimly visible as before--a prolonging white streak with monstrous undulations, ending with a sharp ascension. Its course this time was at a right angle to its former one, and its impatience so great that it struck the enemy before he had nearly reached the lowest point of his arc. In consequence he went flying round and round in a horizontal circle whose radius was about equal to half the length of the rope, which I forgot to say was nearly twenty feet long. His shrieks, crescendo in approach and diminuendo in recession, made the rapidity of his revolution more obvious to the ear than to the eye. He had evidently not yet been struck in a vital spot. His posture in the sack and the distance from the ground at which he hung compelled the ram to operate upon his lower extremities and the end of his back. Like a plant that has struck its root into some poisonous mineral, my poor uncle was dying slowly upward.|$|E

60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment, during which Mrs. Goyte {{remained}} with her <b>head</b> <b>dropped,</b> sinister and abstracted. Suddenly she lifted her face, and her eyes flashed.|$|R
