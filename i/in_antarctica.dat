5|$|Peter I Island {{is one of}} Norway's two {{territorial}} claims <b>in</b> <b>Antarctica,</b> {{the other}} being Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim {{which is not a}} sector. Being south of 60°S, the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can only be used for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims <b>in</b> <b>Antarctica.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also {{known as}} the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main {{instrument}} concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity <b>in</b> <b>Antarctica.</b> The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues <b>in</b> <b>Antarctica</b> by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.|$|E

5|$|Each year, {{scientists}} from 28 different nations conduct experiments not reproducible {{in any other}} place in the world.

5|$|Emilio Marcos Palma was {{the first}} person born south of the 60th {{parallel}} south (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty), as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born <b>in</b> <b>Antarctica.</b> Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.
