5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the <b>Financial</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between the states and the Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E

The Federal Ministry of Transport and Communications emphasised that the project would be re-examined and that the results would be available within weeks.

25|$|In 1956, Jentschke {{became an}} ordinarius Professor of Physics at the University of Hamburg. There, {{he found a}} {{positive}} climate, as well as funding, for his vision of building a new institute around a particle accelerator. An international particle accelerator conference at CERN in 1956 was helpful in the decision of which accelerator to build. His vision could not be supported by Hamburg alone, so negotiations took place to bring {{in support of the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Germany (Länder). A <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed on 18 December 1959, which founded the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), a 7.5 GeV electron synchrotron. Jentschke was chairman of the DESY Board of Directors from 1959 to 1970, and for many years also the director of the Second Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Hamburg. While at DESY, Jentschke endorsed the electron-positron storage ring scheme for the DORIS accelerator, and promoted the use of synchrotron radiation for research purposes.|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 1907, the Ferguson Trust Board voted Taft a commission, and on December 16, {{he signed}} a $38,000 {{contract}} to commence work. [...] The commission was the first commission from the Ferguson fund. Despite the <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> it would be some time before a determination of a site for the work. [...] Ward's suit continued to loom over the deliberations. [...] One proposal was to locate it in Grant Park south of the Art Institute and another was to locate it at the 35th Street and Grand Boulevard (Now Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive) intersection that now hosts the Chicago Landmark and National Register of Historic Places-listed Victory Monument. The 1909 Art Institute annual report mentioned {{a proposal for a}} sunken garden with a focal fountain south of the Institute. [...] Legal issues regarding land use intensified in 1910, and the Art Institute began to make modest plans for the fountain almost attached to the south wall of its own building. [...] For the next few years there was little mention of the fountain as Taft focused on other work. Then in May 1913, the fountain model at Taft's Midway Studios was disassembled and taken to Jules Berchem's foundry for bronze casting. [...] Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge designed the base for the sculpture. [...] It was subsequently assembled by mid-August in preparation for a September 9, 1913 dedication date.|$|E

He ordered the dreadnought battle cruiser, Australia and established the <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> of 1909, which gave the States annual grants of 25 shillings ($2.50) per person, which was the basis of Commonwealth-state financial arrangements until 1927.

2500|$|In 1933, Arlosoroff and German Reich {{officials}} {{viewed the}} British Mandate of Palestine as {{a land of}} opportunity for very different reasons.

In addition, a <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> with Zionist leaders for the transfer of the refugees would help bolster a German economy adversely affected by anti-Nazi boycotts. For Arlosoroff and other Zionists, however, the potential mass transfer of Germany's Jews along with their assets to Eretz Israel presented a historic opportunity to help guarantee the future establishment of a Jewish nation in Mandatory Palestine.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{plans for}} a dam in the Syrian part of the Euphrates date to 1927, but these were not carried out. In 1957, an {{agreement}} was reached with the Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of}} a dam in the Euphrates, and in 1960 a <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed with West Germany. Another agreement to finance the project was signed with the Soviet Union in 1965. The project included a hydroelectric power station in the Tabqa Dam, and the construction of a vast irrigation network capable of irrigating [...] of land on both sides of the Euphrates. Construction of the dam lasted between 1968 and 1973 and the flooding of the reservoir commenced in 1974 by reducing the flow of the Euphrates. In 1975, Iraq complained that the flow of the Euphrates had been reduced below an acceptable level and threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam; mediation by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union eventually settled this dispute.|$|E

2500|$|The renamed Sussex Railroad Company gained {{support by}} issuing stock and bonds, which raised the {{necessary}} funds {{to lay the}} new track. Ground was broken on the [...] track gauge line from Newton to Waterloo on May 5, 1853. The company wanted to proceed quickly {{to meet the deadline}} for the agreement that, if met, would mean a substantial source of revenue. Because of this fast pace, steeper grades and tighter curves were adopted than might have been preferred otherwise. Work progressed quickly, even though the M was trying to slow down progress any way they could, including compensating employees of the Sussex Railroad to delay the necessary cuts south of Newton. To speed work along, the Sussex Railroad Company used employees of the Andover Mine temporarily on the railroad right-of-way. All of this effort paid off as they were successful in meeting the deadline. The new railroad was completed and the first train entered Newton on November 27, 1854, with traffic between Newton and Waterloo being opened on December 11, 1854. The M connected to the Sussex Railroad in January 1855, thus the <b>financial</b> <b>agreement</b> made earlier was upheld.|$|E

His next film would be 1988's Johnny Be Good, in which he worked with Uma Thurman and fellow Saturday Night Live cast member Robert Downey, Jr. The film was a critical failure, and some critics panned Hall's performance as a high school football star, claiming that he, the movies' reigning geek, was miscast for the role.
