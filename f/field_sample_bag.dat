40|$|As soil–atmosphere fluxes of {{greenhouse}} gases are characterized by high temporal fluctuations, frequent measurements {{in the range of}} hours to days need to be deployed, resulting in high analytical costs. We have therefore developed a new low-cost system that combines high-frequency automated sampling with low-frequency chemical analysis. The System for Inert Gas Monitoring by Accumulation (SIGMA) is suited particularly for stand-alone observations in remote locations. The SIGMA is connected to an automated chamber with headspace sampling several times per day. Air samples are aggregated in <b>sampling</b> <b>bags,</b> which reduces the number of subsequent laboratory analyses and allows calculation of average flux rates over extended sampling periods.

40|$|Data on {{the acute}} and/or {{long-term}} toxicity of colored smokes {{appear to be}} scarce and inconsistent. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to obtain more insight on this matter. For this purpose, existing platforms for in vitro toxicity screening are evaluated with respect to their applicability to determining the toxicity of colored smokes. The platforms chosen are CULTEX® using human lung cells (A 549) or human keratinocytes (HaCat) in culture to study acute toxicity, and CULTEX® with an Ames module, using bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium), to study long-term adverse effects. The tested colored smokes are green, yellow and red. Acute toxicity was determined as follows: the colored smoke grenade was ignited inside a ventilated bunker. Wells containing the lung cells and keratinocytes were placed in the vicinity of the grenade and were thus exposed to the colored smoke. Meanwhile the smoke was sampled in a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> the number of particles in the smoke was counted and the particle sizes were determined with an aerosol particle sizer. Next, the exposed cells were cultured and various parameters that are indicative of cell toxicity were measured. Also, other wells with lung cells and keratinocytes were exposed to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> using the CULTEX® system. The composition of the smoke collected in the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> was determined using continuous two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (GC*GC-Tof-MS). Long-term toxicity was studied by exposing the bacteria in the CULTEX® Ames module to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag.</b> Next, the bacteria were cultured on a medium which lacks an essential nutrient for these bacteria. Consequently, the bacteria cannot grow on this medium. However, mutagenic compounds will enable the bacteria to produce the essential nutrient, and therefore they will grow on this medium.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{environmental}} analysis, researchers rely on the accurate qualitative and quantitative assessment of odorous compounds in the gas phase. In recent years, attention has been mainly given to advanced hyphenated analytical techniques {{and the development of}} new detectors (e. g. e-noses, SIFT-MS, etc.). However, the sample collection step is equally important and strongly influences reproducibility and accuracy. Whole air <b>sampling</b> using polymeric <b>bags</b> {{is still one of the}} most frequently used sample collection methods in the field. The degree of scalping, which is defined as sorption of the volatiles on the inner surface of polymeric <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> is often underestimated, in particular in the <b>field</b> of environmental <b>sampling.</b> In this work a Phase Ratio Variation (PRV) method is suggested as a fast and efficient manner for predicting the degree of scalping for individual compounds, and thus enabling to compensate for sorption phenomena.

From dataset 1, direct analysis of <b>field</b> <b>samples</b> revealed 57 morphotypes, whereas only 21 of these were detected by trap culture. Community variation (beta diversity) analysis revealed that <b>field</b> <b>samples</b> are far more sensitive in detecting shifts in AMF community composition among land uses than trap cultures in the Amazon region, with the combined results of both methods being not better than that obtained only by direct analysis of <b>field</b> <b>samples.</b> Analysis of dataset 2 showed that the relative performance of trap cultures, using direct analysis of <b>field</b> <b>sample</b> as reference, was inversely related to the total observed AMF species richness...|$|R
