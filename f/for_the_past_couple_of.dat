500|$|The album's {{influence}} has reached beyond jazz, as musicians of such genres as rock and classical {{have been influenced}} by it, while critics have written about it {{as one of the most}} influential albums of all time. Many improvisatory rock musicians of the 1960s referred to Kind of Blue for inspiration, along with other Davis albums, as well as Coltrane's modal records My Favorite Things (1961) and A Love Supreme (1965). Guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band said his soloing on songs such as [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" [...] "comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue. I've listened to that album so many times that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years, I haven't hardly listened to anything else." [...] Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright said that the chord progressions on the album influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song [...] "Breathe" [...] on their landmark opus The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In his book Kind of Blue: The Making of a Miles Davis Masterpiece, writer Ashley Kahn wrote [...] "still acknowledged as the height of hip, four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapory piano introduction is universally recognized". [...] Producer Quincy Jones, one of Davis' longtime friends, wrote: [...] "That [...] will always be my music, man. I play Kind of Blue every day—it's my orange juice. It still sounds like it was made yesterday". Pianist Chick Corea, one of Miles' acolytes, was also struck by its majesty, later stating [...] "It's one thing to just play a tune, or play a program of music, but it's another thing to practically create a new language of music, which is what Kind of Blue did." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt had officially cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said {{it took the}} decision to cut {{diplomatic ties}} due to Qatar’s “embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region”, including the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and groups supported by Iran in the kingdom’s eastern province of Qatif. Islam Hassan argues [...] "Starting from 2000 and ahead, Qatar has been pursuing an independent foreign policy that at times clash with the Saudi strategic interests in the region. The fact that Qatar has not been toeing the Saudi foreign policy, and dealing with states and non-state actors that the Saudis do not approve of have caused this tension in relations {{over the past couple}} of years, mainly after the Arab uprisings. This tension was revived by the hacking saga of Qatar News Agency and the statement that was attributed to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, which Qatar falsified later. This happened at a time Mohamed bin Salman is facing competition from Mohamed bin Nayef over the Saudi throne. Mohamed bin Salman tried to have the US blessing during Trump's visit to Saudi to force Qatar to its knees and go back home with a win that would give him more popularity in Saudi Arabia, easing his journey to power. With regards to UAE, there has been always competition between al-Nahyans of Abu Dhabi and al-Thanis of Qatar. This competition goes back to the 1800s. The Arab uprisings ushered a new chapter in the Qatari-Emirati competition. The competition led to the Emiratis playing a major role in the withdrawal of ambassadors from Qatar in 2014. At the beginning of the current diplomatic crisis, particularly after the hacking saga, UAE was trying to maintain the problem. Yet, Aljazeera's publishing of Yousuf al-Otaiba's leaked emails got the UAE on board with Saudi Arabia. Insofar as Bahrain is concerned, the small Kingdom has been toeing the Saudi foreign policy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years.

40|$|The port-Hamiltonian {{modelling}} {{and control}} of power converters has been the topic {{of a number of}} studies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> years. However, <b>the</b> modelling of three-phase converters from fundamental port-Hamiltonian principles has been an unexplored direction. This study focusses on deducing a modelling procedure to model a three-phase rectifier and a three-phase inverter from a fundamental port-Hamiltonian perspective. Such a perspective involves the derivation of a model from a mathematical expression of the Dirac structure. Two procedures are formulated, where either the switches are viewed as virtual elements or as nonlinear elements. The study concludes that both techniques are equally suitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> modelling of the rectifier and the inverter. Furthermore, incorporating non-ideal switches is easier when regarding them as nonlinear elements, but obtaining a parametrised form (parametrised by the switch state) is more straightforward when regarding them as virtual elements.

The base case, C 1 contains sinter (bulk material) which is needed for obtaining 1 tone of pig iron, quartz which provides slag alkalinity and coke as reducing and energy agent.

Small rodents in southeast Nebraska were trapped and sampled at eight study sites using live capture traps. Captured rodents were assessed for active parasitism by ticks which were collected and placed in alcohol. Tissue samples were then taken and analyzed using PCR for Rickettsia rickettsii and Borrelia sp. spirochetes. All 504 ticks collected from the 212 various rodents were identified as either larval or nymphal American dog ticks, Dermacentor variabilis (Say). Infestation prevalence was 51 % (109 / 212) total with highest prevalence seen in Peromyscus maniculatus (58 %), Peromyscus leucopus (51 %) and Mus musculus (35 %). No evidence of either pathogen was identified by PCR. Retropharyngeal lymph node samples from across Nebraska were taken from hunter-killed deer during the open rifle season and analyzed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Borrelia sp. spirochetes by PCR. Lymph node samples from southeast Nebraska, south-central Nebraska, and mid-central Nebraska were selected for analysis. Ehrlichia chaffeensis was identified in lymph node samples from all three study sets. Southeast Nebraska had 10 positive samples (10 / 49 – 20 %), south-central had 14 positive samples (14 / 50 – 28 %) and mid-central had one positive result (1 / 50 – 2 %). The overall prevalence from all localities tested was 17 % (25 / 149). No positive PCR samples were identified containing Borrelia sp. DNA. This study demonstrates that lone star tick-associated pathogens are present in Nebraska wildlife. Transmission of these pathogens is probable as white-tailed deer are reservoirs <b>for</b> some of <b>the</b> pathogens demonstrated in this study. Further epidemiological and ecological studies are warranted as these organisms are of veterinary and public health importance. Advisor: Roberto Cortina...|$|R
