Each herbicide was used at recommended dose and reduced by half. Spray volume and nozzle type did not affect activity of the mixture iodosulfuron methyl sodium + amidosulfuron, but differentiated the efficacy of OD formulation of iodosulfuron methyl sodium + mesosulfuron methyl, when it was applied at lowered dose. As spray volume rose, herbicide efficacy decreased. Nozzle type influenced OD formulation of the mixture iodosulfuron methyl sodium + mesosulfuron methyl, independently on dose.

The method consists in casting a suitable solution, continuously supplied by a nozzle, onto a moving substrate.

Due to a gradient of the solute concentration, its solidification proceeds in a narrow zone under highly anisotropic conditions.

This work {{shows that}} the zone casting- a method for the {{solution}} casting based fabrication of oriented anisotropic layers of organic materials- can also be applied to fabrication of patterned layers.

Mean flow self-similarity {{was the first to}} establish itself, followed by the mass flux fluctuations, followed in turn by the total temperature fluctuations. Use of a modified Van Driest transformation resulted in good correlation of smooth and rough wall data {{in the form of the}} incompressible law of the wall.

The present data are found to correlate well with previously published roughness effect data from low and high speed flows when the roughnesses are characterized by an equivalent sand grain roughness height. Existing correlations based on low speed data were found to be unsuccessful in predicting the effect of this roughness on the skin friction and velocity profile. The indiscriminate use of low speed roughness effects correlations to predict the effects of roughness on supersonic and hypersonic flows must therefore be regarded as a procedure subject to gross errors. Significant pressure and temperature history effects were observed throughout the boundary layer. The existence of these effects was found to create a nozzle wall boundary layer whose properties were far different than those in a boundary layer on a flat plate in the freestream, raising questions about the validity of simulating the flat plate boundary layer with the nozzle wall boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with the visual simulation of high pressure arc plasmas in two different applications. The first one is an arc maintained in water for the formation of nano-structures such as nanotubes and fullerenes. The second application is high power switching using puffer circuit breakers. The fundamental behaviour of both arc plasmas was computationally studied. The structure of the thesis starts with an introduction to the background and objectives of the present work, the arc models used for the two applications are described in Chapter 2 together with a consideration of the radiation and turbulence models, material properties initial and boundary conditions, and issues relating to solution procedures. Chapter 3 is devoted to the modelling of the carbon plasma in water taking into account size of gas bubble growth, water evaporation and chemical reactions in the gas. Chapter 4 presents the computational simulation of the whole arcing process of a high voltage puffer circuit breaker where predicted arc voltage and pressure evolution in the storage volume are compared with the test results. Modelling of the current zero period and the calculation of the critical RRRV is also included. The proposed method for object based visual simulation is described in Chapter 5. Finally conclusions are drawn in Chapter 6 together with a discussion of the future work. For the arc in water case, {{it is the first time}} that an arc model is applied to study the carbon arc confined in water considering chemical reactions of water vapour and carbon vapour. The arc is generated between two carbon electrodes which are immersed in water with a gap length of 1 mm. The anode has a conical shape with a rod diameter of 8. 2 mm and a tip diameter of 2 mm with a full conical angle of 60 o. The anode has a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 12 mm. A local thermal equilibrium arc model was used to tackle the problem based without considering the sheath layer in front of the electrodes. The loss of carbon vapour due to formation of solid carbon structures is represented by a negative volumetric source. The erosion rate of the anode is derived from experimental result. Results show that the strong influx of carbon vapour displaced the original water vapour in the gap in a few microseconds, typically 5 μs. By 4 ms the arc burns in a carbon dominated environment with about 25 % of water vapour in the region near the cathode. Our results thus suggest that for most of the time the arc can be regarded as burning in a carbon vapour dominated environment. Reaction rate coefficient between carbon vapour and water vapour was derived from that at low temperature (300 K) using the well known Arrhenius expression. The value of this coefficient is 1. 054 × 106. It has been found that the mass concentration of H 2 and CO peaks in a layer surrounding the arc column. The maximum concentration is only 0. 2 % and 2. 8 % respectively, in a region near the cathode surface. Although typically 30 % of the carbon vapour is consumed by chemical reaction, water vapour still dominates the arc surrounding gaseous environment since the erosion rate of carbon anode (6 × 10 - 7 kg/s) is still much lower than the water evaporation rate (6 × 10 - 5 kg/s). The predicted voltage of the arc column at 30 A is 7 V while the measured arc voltage including the sheaths is 17 – 20 V. The difference is attributed mainly to the exclusion of the electrode sheath model in the present work. Considering that the first ionisation energy of carbon vapour at ground state which is 11. 26 eV, the predicted voltage of the arc column is well placed in the expected range. A numerical scheme has been established in the present work to simulate the growth of gas bubble confined in water. The position change of the interface of the bubble-water is controlled by the pressure difference between that inside the bubble and the atmospheric pressure. The inertia of the water surrounding the bubble is taken into account in the construction of the dynamic response. Our results show that the growth of the bubble is dominated in the first half millisecond by the retreat of the water surface as a result of evaporation. Further on in the arcing process, the pressure difference makes a dominant contribution in the growth of the bubble. For the switching arc case, the arcing process for four test duties of a 252 kV puffer circuit breaker has been simulated. A novel method was proposed to improve the arc voltage prediction by mitigating the effect of Lorentz force near the tips of hollow contacts and their filling transparent contacts. The proposal of this method is based on consideration of the most probable practical scenario in reality. Results present in the thesis show that this method is effective and gives satisfactory arc voltage prediction for all four test cases at different current levels and arc durations. As an example the arc voltage in the 47 kA case at 16. 8 ms with an instantaneous current of 55 kA is 220 V, almost the same as that of the measurement while without using the method the prediction is 340 V. Turbulence is important in the interruption process of high voltage SF 6 circuit breakers. It has been found that Prandtl mixing length model with a constant turbulence parameter is not able to predict the important extinction peak in the puffer circuit breaker. In the present work this turbulence parameter is made variable, as a function of instantaneous current that is an indirect measure of the presence of cold SF 6 flow around the arc column. The modified turbulence model was then applied to simulated the current zero period (from 15 kA before final current zero onwards to the current zero point) of a 47 kA case and a 10 kA case. The predicted arc voltage using the modified turbulence model starts to increase rapidly shortly before the final current zero point, qualitatively agree with the measurement. A detailed comparison is not sensible since the accuracy of the measurement is not known. The present work covers the simulation of the cold flow period, the high current, current zero and the post arc periods. The predicted pressure variation in the puffer cylinder and another three points including the middle of the <b>flat</b> <b>nozzle</b> surface all agrees reasonably well with the corresponding measurement. Detailed results on the high current phase were represented and discussed. The thermal interruption capability of a circuit breaker is represented by the critical RRRV, a value of the rate of rise of recovery voltage that the circuit breaker can with stands. Procedures were set up and some example results reported in the thesis. Accurate prediction of the critical RRRV is not possible at present. Nevertheless, the established procedure for the calculation of the post arc current under the influence of system recovery voltage can be of help in studying the behaviour response of a circuit breaker when a design parameter is changed. The shift of the critical RRRV in response to a design parameter change gives an indication of the effectiveness of the change in design. Computer simulation of electric arcs for industrial devices proves a difficult job in the sense that much coding and setting is required to implement the arc in a chosen software package. An approach has proposed to use Object oriented programming to change the model setup from manually to automatic. The feasibility of the approach has been demonstrated in the present work by a component builder and a Visual Analyser and Monitor (VCM). Information exchange between ISEE and the CFD solver is through memory sharing. Typical results for visual simulation are given in Chapter 2, demonstrating a range of useful functionalities it provides and the benefits for arc modellers. A number of aspects of the present work that require further work were identified. The importance of obtaining experimental results was discussed. This include the mass spectroscopic measurement of gases generated in the arc in water case, the more accurate arc voltage measurement just before current zero, and the post arc current measurement...|$|E
50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full cone nozzles {{have the largest}} drop size, {{followed}} by <b>flat</b> spray <b>nozzles.</b> Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest drop size. Spraying pressure: Drop size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on drop size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure drop and decrease the drop size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure drop and increase the drop size.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{evaluation of}} a Gaussian tilting plume model adapted to ground spraying drift is presented. The spray drift deposit of each droplet diameter class measured by a laser particle analyser is computed independently. The summation of these footprints results in the global drift of the nozzle. The methodology is applied to derive from the model the drift of a <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> located in a wind tunnel. Discrepancies from experimental data are commented and potentialities for further improvement of this approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{spraying}} nozzles {{have been studied}} with respect to droplet size and velocity of the sprayed rapeseed oil depending on the applied liquid and air pressures. For the nozzle with a wide angle round spray the air pressure should be lower than the oil pressure and {{should be in the}} range of 1. 5 and 2. 5 bar. For the <b>flat</b> spray <b>nozzle</b> the variation in droplet size is small and the oil and air pressure may vary between 2. 0 and 3. 0 ba...|$|R
40|$|For {{pesticides}} {{to effectively}} manage pests, they {{must first be}} deposited on the target (typically a plant surface) in a {{manner in which the}} active ingredient(s) can be readily taken up by the target organism. A plant architectural model that enables the location of various plant components in 3 -D space combined with a particle trajectory model has been used to study the interception of spray droplets by various vegetative elements. Results from the simulation are compared with wind tunnel studies of glyphosate deposition on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var. Sicala), sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) and wild oats (Avena ludoviciana Durieu). An air induction <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> (AI 110015 at 500 kPa pressure) and an extended range <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> (XR 11002 at 280 kPa pressure) were predicted to have similar glyphosate deposition on cotton and sow thistle plants, whereas the extended range nozzle resulted in higher deposit on wild oats. Spray deposition (µg cm- 2) on wild oat plants at the 5 -leaf stage was more than double the amount of deposition on sow thistle or wild oat plants at the 2 -leaf stage. The model was in good agreement with the experimental data except that it tended to over predict deposition on sow thistle plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate two tips of spraying nozzles (hollow cone <b>nozzle</b> and two <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> annexed to a nozzle body DUO) and three spray volumes (100, 150 and 200 dm 3 ha- 1), whose application was for the control of the Asian soybean rust. An area of 288 m 2 was used, with a randomized blocks design in a factorial 2 × 3 with 4 repetitions, total of 24 experimental parcels of 12 m 2. For the spraying with hydraulical nozzles a costal spray of constant pressure kept by C 02 compressed with bar of 2 m was used. The analysis of the covering percentage was carried through by means of the use of hidro-sensible paper, that was placed in three position of the plant what it represents, in height, the third superior, average and inferior of the canopy. For both the third no interaction between the evaluated factors, was found and meither difference statistics between the spraying tips and the volumes. In absolute values the twin <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> DUO presented minimum difference of covering in relation to the hollow cone nozzle, and for the spray volume of 200 dm 3 ha - 1 presented greater covering percentage...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{water jet}} {{technology}} {{has been used for}} jet cutting. The discharge pressures of these nozzles extend from 100 MPa to 400 MPa, and in extreme cases, to 1000 MPa. The merits of this technology are to get the minimum power required, and the highly dense energy for cutting using small jet diameters. But, it is hard for this technology to peel wide skins of relatively soft objects. In this report, plain water jet technology with low pressure, below 3 MPa, is investigated for peeling the skin of circular objects, such as vegetables. Eight <b>flat</b> <b>nozzles</b> 45 degrees apart are installed in a concentric circle. The axes of nozzles intersect {{at the center of the}} circle, and the plain water jets are on the same plane. A test cylinder is set among the nozzles, in order to measure static pressure on its surface. First, a suitable relation between the test cylinder diameter and the nozzle distance is examined experimentally. Next, a burdock is set instead of a test cylinder, pulled up with constant velocity and peeled by plain water jets. It is apparent that for proper peeling, there are appropriate combinations of the pull-up velocity and the discharge pressure. Lastly, the required power for peeling a burdock is estimated. ...|$|R
50|$|Impact of a spray {{onto the}} target surface is {{expressed}} as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2. This value {{depends on the}} spray pattern distribution and the spray angle. Generally, solid stream nozzles or narrow spray angle <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzles</b> are used for applications in which high impact is desired, such as cleaning. When a nozzle is used for cleaning, the impact or pressure is called impingement. As with all spray patterns, the unit impact decreases as {{the distance from the}} nozzle increases, thereby increasing the impact area size.|$|R
40|$|In 2011 ‒ 2012 single nozzle field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effect}} of different <b>flat</b> fan spray <b>nozzles</b> of the spray drift reduction classes 50, 75, 90 and 95 % on spray drift at two different forward speeds (7. 2 km h- 1 and 14. 4 km h- 1). Experiments were performed with a single nozzle spraying on an outdoor spray track perpendicular to the wind direction. Nozzle types were compared with the BCPC threshold nozzle Fine/ Medium and a standard <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> TeeJet XR 11004. Ground deposits were measured from 1 m upwind to 10 m downwind with respect to the nozzle. At 5 and 10 m distances, airborne spray drift was measured with passive and active collectors. Differences in spray drift reduction were measured for the different nozzle types. Results showed that with a higher nozzle forward speed the spray drift deposition increased for both the ground deposition and the airborne spray drift. Higher nozzle forward speeds may lead to nozzles to be classified in a lower spray drift reduction class...|$|R
40|$|The {{neem tree}} has a {{recognized}} insecticidal activity against insects that damage several crops. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of neem exctracts and application methods on the damage and development of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae on maize. Two experiments were carried out at Embrapa Milho e Sorgo, Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil, under greenhouse conditions. Maize leaves were sprayed varying the neem extracts, sprayer nozzles, concentration and number of application. In the first experiment, the results showed the smallest damage to chlorpyrifos (2. 00) and for the aqueous extracts from neem leaves (2. 50) applied three times through <b>flat</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The commercial extract did not protect maize leaves from larval damage (7. 22 to 7. 90). The larval development showed consistent with the low leaves damage, resulting in the low larval weight (97. 41 mg). In the second experiment, the smallest leaves damage (2. 62 and 2. 65) were observed in three applications of the aqueous extract, using 80. 01 / 80. 04 / 80. 01 nozzles, 10, 000 and 7, 500 ppm, respectively. The highest extract concentration provided low larval weight (60. 21 mg). In conclusion, the three applications of neem leaves extract (10, 000 ppm), using 80. 01 / 80. 04 / 80. 01 nozzles, is most effective to protect maize from fall armyworm damage. All the extract concentrations evaluated affect the larval development...|$|R
50|$|Adequate {{coverage}} of fungicides will maximize fungicide performance. Adequate coverage {{can be achieved}} by applying fungicides in 2 gallons of water per 1000 ft2 through an air induction or <b>flat</b> fan <b>nozzle</b> producing fine to medium size droplets. Fungicide applications on golf courses normally require large commercial sprayers equipped with the appropriate nozzles. Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary for applying most fungicides and includes coveralls over short-sleeved shirts and pants, chemical resistant gloves, chemical resistant footwear, and protective eyewear. Always follow label precautions, including restricted entry intervals (REI) and first aid, when applying any pesticide.|$|R
