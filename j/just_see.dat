Early in their sessions, they reportedly were [...] "fooling around" [...] and [...] "freestyling". One night, Danja was playing a guitar riff and {{caught the attention of}} Timberlake, who then started humming to the melody and later sung the lyrics. Timbaland, who was at their side, added drums onto the progressing sound. After an hour, with no lyrics written on paper, Timberlake recorded in the vocal booth a song that would become [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around".

500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or five in the morning, so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't <b>just</b> <b>see</b> myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} with Hoppus and DeLonge going into {{separate}} rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two {{had not spoken}} {{to each other about}} the lyrics ahead of time, {{and it turned out that}} the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, 'Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and <b>just</b> <b>see</b> how it works for the song.' And we never second-guessed it. We were like, 'That sounds rad.'" ...|$|E

No one else makes television like them and yet still they push themselves." [...] For Clare Murphy, writing in the Daily Mirror, the episode [...] "makes great use of CCTV split-screen footage". Dessau said that the set-up gave the episode [...] "its haunting flavour". Viewers do not <b>just</b> <b>see</b> Andy, but also streams from other cameras, which, for Dessau, [...] "makes the viewer both intrigued and anxious". Boyd, too, claimed that the episode played on the [...] "inherent creepiness" [...] of CCTV footage. She said that the split-screen set-up increased the tension, and that the [...] "gimmick is a good one"; though it could [...] "have worked well as a pleasing novelty on its own, [...] also makes this 'whodunit'/'who's doing it' a refreshingly inventive take on the genre".|$|E
500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather <b>just</b> <b>see</b> them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't <b>just</b> <b>see</b> him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know.

500|$|By appearance, {{he is an}} {{overweight}} corporate head that takes the name Wilson Fisk, but in fact he is the sole person running organized crime, under the moniker of Kingpin. Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and {{the man responsible for}} the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in [...] He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying [...] "they watch movies to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.' But I want them to get past that and <b>just</b> <b>see</b> the movie for what it is and see me for what I am—an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, John, having just chewed {{his way out of}} a dog carrier, meets Apu, who exclaims [...] "Elton John!", to which John replies [...] "That's my name! Well, not really." [...] The {{exchange}} references John's name change, as his birth name was Reginald Dwight. At the end of the episode, John performs for Apu and Manjula {{on the roof of the}} Kwik-E-Mart. The scene is a callback to the season 7 episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian", in which Paul McCartney performed on the roof. The scene in which Homer is seen jamming Valentine's Day cards into their holders were based on an observation by the writers. Simpsons writer George Meyer said of the scene: [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>see</b> cards get really man-handled, and the envelopes get switched with the wrong sizes." [...] In another scene, Marge and Manjula are seen playing badminton. While the scene was conceived in order to provide exposition, the sport was included because badminton is [...] "very popular" [...] in India, according to Simpsons writer Ian Maxtone-Graham. The episode also mentions the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. In a scene, Apu, carrying a shopping bag, exits the jewellery and silverware store Tiffany & Co. Meanwhile, Homer, along with Chief Wiggum, Moe, Flanders and Dr Hibbert are watching Apu, assuming he bought jewellery for Manjula. It is soon revealed that Apu bought a croissant in the store, to which Wiggum says [...] "Oh, that's right, they have breakfast at Tiffany's now." [...] The heart-shaped fade out at the end of the episode is a reference to the series Love, American Style.|$|E
