50|$|The 1962 Stock {{units were}} {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} earlier 1959 Stock units, which were built for the Piccadilly line, although a number or improvements were introduced {{as a result of}} experience with the earlier trains. The major improvement was the use of motor alternators for the auxiliary supplies using static rectification, instead of the motor generator sets. The <b>drivers</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> used the more reliable poppet valve instead of rotary type face valves, and the electro-pneumatic valves used plug in connectors, speeding up replacement and reducing faults due to bad electrical connections.|$|E
40|$|The paper shows a {{comparison}} of different braking technologies for freight trains and their effects on in-train forces. At this aim, the UIC certified software TrainDy is employed. Freight train sets, having one and two remote locomotives, are investigated both as coupled trains and as fixed train compositions. There is also {{an evaluation of the}} in-train forces of freight train sets equipped by electro-pneumatic brakes and disk brakes. The case of two remote locomotives is further explored showing the minor benefits of an ad hoc activation of <b>drivers</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> compared to the benefits of an optimized mass distribution, for train sets both coupled and fixed...|$|E

50|$|The unit itself used air brakes, {{but it was}} {{equipped}} to operate trains with air or vacuum brakes. The brake system would be set up for either air or vacuum train working {{by means of a}} turning switch on the <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> and by pre-setting the appropriate <b>brake</b> <b>valves</b> in the corridor.|$|R
50|$|In EP operation, a distributor, {{performing}} functions {{similar to}} those of the triple valve, is operated directly and instantly by electrical control from the <b>driver’s</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> The Westinghouse <b>brake</b> cylinders and air reservoirs and pumps are used, so that only the means of transmitting the driver’s command is changed.|$|R
25|$|The power cars {{received}} new bogie {{frames and}} a new power supply for the air conditioning. The power cars of trainsets 01 to 20 were refitted with GTO power converters. Smaller measures included diagnosis and subsequent repair of the <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> the installation of new relays into some safety circuits and some software changes.|$|R
50|$|Its {{furnishings}} {{are very}} simple and resemble {{those in a}} bus (hence the name Schienenbus or railbus): one large open coach shared also by the engine driver, seats which can be folded two-ways depending on the direction of travel and simple lighting from bare light bulbs with no covers. The production vehicles were <b>braked</b> using a <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{release of}} {{compressed}} {{air into the}} brake cylinders is achieved by triple valves, which are themselves controlled by the pressure of air in the train pipe, a pneumatic pipe running {{the length of the}} train. When the driver wishes to make a brake application, he operates the <b>driver’s</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> which releases some air from the train pipe, so operating the triple valves. When the driver wishes to release the brakes, his operation of the <b>driver’s</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> returns compressed air (stored in a cylinder near the driving position) into the train pipe and this moves the triple valve so as to release the air in the brake cylinders to atmosphere, allowing the brake blocks to move clear of the wheels. Although, in multiple-unit operation, the air reservoirs on the vehicles can be relatively quickly charged, the restoration of pressure to the train pipe takes some time as air has to travel physically {{down the length of the}} train.|$|R
50|$|The <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{complicated}} valve system for controlling the compressed air brake of a railway vehicle. Depending on its setting, it controls whether the brake pipes of a compressed air brake are evacuated and thus whether braking is applied or maintained; or if the brake pipes are connected to a compressed air reservoir, it controls whether the brakes are released again or remain released.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's brakes were {{operated}} by two 24 in diameter cylinders {{on the engine}} and four 21 in diameter cylinders on the tender. The brake riggings on the tender bogies were independent {{of each other and}} the front tender bogie was equipped with a hand brake. The engine and tender brake pipelines were fitted with delaying <b>valves</b> which delayed <b>brake</b> application on the locomotive until a predetermined degree of braking had been established throughout the train. A separate <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> permitted the continued application of locomotive brakes while the train brakes were being released or vacuum was being built up.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} vacuum brake. This {{system was}} similar to the simple vacuum system, except that the creation of vacuum in the train pipe exhausted vacuum reservoirs on every vehicle and released the <b>brakes.</b> If the <b>driver</b> applied the <b>brake,</b> his <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> admitted atmospheric air to the train pipe, and this atmospheric pressure applied the brakes against the vacuum in the vacuum reservoirs. Being an automatic brake, this system applies braking effort if the train becomes divided or if the train pipe is ruptured. Its disadvantage is that the large vacuum reservoirs were required on every vehicle, and their bulk and the rather complex mechanisms were seen as objectionable.|$|R
50|$|The {{train is}} {{operated}} by the driver either from the engine footplate or from the compartment {{at the other end}} of the train, according to the direction of travel. In the driver's compartment are placed the necessary fittings to give him complete control of the train, These fittings consist of a <b>driver's</b> <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> and air pressure gauges for operating the Westinghouse brake, a cord connected to the whistle on the engine, an electric bell operated from the footplate, a bell push for communication by bell code with the fireman, and an air valve controlling the movements of the steam regulator on the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} air {{reservoirs}} on each vehicle and compressed air is released from these reservoirs to the brake cylinders as {{the pressure in}} the train pipe is reduced by the <b>driver</b> operating the <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> This process causes a mechanical linkage to press the brake blocks against the wheels.|$|R

25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> and the <b>brakes</b> operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the <b>driver's</b> side <b>brakes.</b> On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R

50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully. There was also an issue where a connecting pin in the regulator linkage was prone to falling out.|$|R
