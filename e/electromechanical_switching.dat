25|$|The rapid {{replacement}} of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> {{systems in the}} 1980s with electronic or digital systems eliminated the problem of older switches that would not recognize 911. At this point, 911 service is available in most of North America, {{but there are still}} small, sparsely-populated, or remote areas (such as Nunavut and the Northwest Territories in Canada's Arctic) that do not have it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> systems {{required}} {{sources of}} electricity {{in form of}} direct current (DC), as well as alternating ring current (AC), which were generated on-site with mechanical generators. In addition, telephone switches required adjustment of many mechanical parts. Unlike modern switches, a circuit connecting a dialed call through an electromechanical switch had DC continuity within the local exchange area via metallic conductors.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{switches}} typically used in <b>switch</b> matrices: Coaxial <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>Switches</b> and Solid State Switches, also known as electronic <b>switches.</b> Coaxial <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switches</b> can be further divided into two categories based on their architecture, latching relay and non-latching relay.|$|R

25|$|A {{patchwork}} quilt of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> equipment handled San Jose calls between 1949 and the 1980s. There {{were about}} eight Western Electric Crossbar switches, {{at least one}} Number 1 and mostly Number 5. There was a Western Electric 4A Crossbar that took up two floors of the Main telephone exchange. In the mid-1980s, the 4A crossbar was replaced with a digital switch which took up part of a single floor and quadrupled calling capacity.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. <b>Electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> equipment of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers. Large numbers of calls would otherwise have overloaded switching equipment causing slow dial tone and blocked long distance circuits.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> {{equipment}} {{still in}} use {{made it difficult to}} adapt to recognize 911, especially in small towns and rural areas where the call might have to be switched over a considerable distance.

2500|$|The Mountain Office {{served the}} Summit Road {{community}} {{and areas of}} the Santa Cruz Mountains west of town. Although the office code or prefix for service from this switch was ELgato-3 (later 353), [...] it was not {{referred to as the}} Three Office. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the area was served by Automatic Electric step-by-step (SXS) <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> equipment. The step office was a maintenance headache; it being in a rural area made the problem more difficult. Users noticed crosstalk, and dial pulsing was audible during at least some of their calls. Outside the plant in the mountain area was subject to a variety of tough environmental factors, including long loop lengths and the high humidity of the redwood forest. The area is now served by remote equipment on Summit Road connected to the central office on Los Gatos Boulevard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|E
50|$|The {{attempts}} {{to replace the}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division switching systems used <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> networks with SPC. Nonetheless, private automatic branch exchanges (PABX) and smaller exchanges do use electronic switching devices. The two types of space division electronic switching systems are using <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> network and the other using electronic switching network. The second type is fully electronic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electromechanical</b> <b>switches</b> are {{categorized}} as terminated or unterminated. Terminated switches: when a selected path is closed, all other paths are terminated with 50 ohm loads, {{and the current}} to all the solenoids is cut off. Unterminated switches reflect power.|$|R

25|$|Circuits {{interconnecting}} switches {{are called}} trunks.

5000|$|In early <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switches</b> {{including}} panel switch, a [...] "district junctor" [...] handled {{supervision and}} talk battery duties for outgoing calls, {{similar to the}} duties of the cord circuit of manual exchanges. The junctors for incoming calls were simple three-wire connections between the incoming frame and the line frame. In the later <b>electromechanical</b> 5XB <b>switch,</b> junctors only consisted of three wires to connect the two legs of a call: the line and the trunk, of which the latter supplied all talk battery and supervision.|$|R

50|$|The pulse {{repetition}} rate was historically determined {{based on the}} response time needed for <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> systems to operate reliably.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, {{practical}} applications as an alarm device and automatic filling of an aquarium using an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switch</b> manufactured from metallic glass (MG) ribbon is proposed. The elastic response of an initial arc-shaped MG ribbon-based Fe 90. 65 B 3. 9 Cr 2. 75 Si 2. 7 is studied and exploited. Under the applied load F, the amorphous material exhibits a reversible elastic wavy response. During the elastic deformation and multiplication of harmonic undulations, a perfect linear {{contact between the}} waves and support is established. This contact position {{is the same for}} the pair waves, and can be employed to ensure the passage of an electric current, since the ribbon is Fe-based. The reversible elastic wavy response of MG ribbon can be used as an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switch.</b> The lifespan of the ribbon used as a switch is also considered...|$|R

50|$|Second {{generation}} exchanges such as Strowger, panel, rotary, and crossbar switches {{were constructed}} purely from <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> components with analog control electronics, {{and had no}} computer software control. Stored program control was invented by Bell Labs scientist Erna Schneider Hoover in 1954 who reasoned that computer software could control the connection of telephone calls.|$|E
50|$|When <b>electromechanical</b> <b>switching</b> {{system were}} still in use, the current pulses {{generated}} by the rotary dial on the local loop operated electrical relays in the switches at the central office. The mechanical nature of these relays and the loop capacitance, affecting pulse shape, generally limited the speed of operation, the pulsing rate, to ten pulses per second.|$|E
