40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> and increment in polar liquids under external fields. We couple {{a previously}} introduced dipolar solvent model to a uniform electric field and derive the electrostatic kernel of interacting dipoles. This procedure allows an unambiguous {{definition of the}} liquid dielectric permittivity embodying non-linear dielectric response and correlation effects. We find {{that the presence of}} the external field results in a dielectric anisotropy characterized by a two-component dielectric permittivity tensor. The increase of the electric field amplifies the permittivity component parallel to the field direction, i. e. dielectric increment is observed along the field. However, the perpendicular component is lowered below the physiological permittivity εu ≈ 77, indicating <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> perpendicular to the field. By comparison with Molecular Dynamics simulations from the literature, we show that the mean-field level dielectric response theory underestimates <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation.</b> The inclusion of dipolar correlations at the weak-coupling level intensify the mean-field level <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> and improves the agreement with simulation data at weak electric fields. The correlation-corrected theory predicts as well the presence of a metastable configuration corresponding to the antiparallel alignment of dipoles with the field. This prediction can be verified by solvent-explicit simulations where solvent molecules are expected to be trapped transiently in this metastable state. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl...|$|E
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{to the study of}} hydration of polymeric ions in relation to that of analogous simple ions have been made as follows: In {{the first part of the}} thesis, information in sought regarding the hydration of polyions by evaluating the degree of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> near the charged particles. Previously, this had been done only in the ease of isolated simple ions assumed to be point charges. Since the ionic atmosphere can never be removed from the polyions, even in very dilute solutions, the simple electrostatic field cannot be used in the evaluation of the extent of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation.</b> The dielectric constant has therefore been obtained directly as a function of the distance from the polyion from a solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and previously published relations between dielectric constant and field intensity. The solutions have been obtained by numerical methods using a digital electronic computer. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved by this method for the following models: simple ions, cylindrical polyions, spherical polyions and planar colloidal ions. The relative degrees of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> were calculated and related to the relative extents of primary hydration for the different ionic models. The effect of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> on the field and potential functions is also discussed for the various ion models. The second part of the thesis deals with solvent electrostriction and the determination of salting-out by polyelectrolytes. In order to interpret the experimental data obtained on the salting-out of non-electrolytes (argon, ethylene, d- 1 leucine and benzamide) by polyelectrolytes (sodium polyphosphates, potassium polymethacrylate and poly- 4 -vinyl-N-n-butylpyridinium bromide), it was first found necessary to modify the existing salting-out theories for simple ions and a proposed theory for polymeric ions, by taking into account the effect of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> of the solvent near the ions. Such effects are shown to be important in determining salting-out constants and, in fact, lead to the recognition of the necessity for taking into account the specific structure (e. g. effective radius) of the primary hydration shell. Other modifications to the theory are also suggested. In the modified salting-out theory referred to above, the radius of the primary hydration shell in required. The third part of the thesis therefore describes the evaluation of this parameter from experimentally measured apparent molar volumes for simple and polymeric ions. The significance of these apparent molar volumes in relation to the hydration of this polymeric and simple ions is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} calculations for near-field radiation {{heat transfer}} {{based on a}} local dielectric constant approach indicate that the heat transfer will go to infinity as the gap becomes very small. To correct this anomaly, it has been proposed that the heat transfer through very small gaps will saturate due {{to the influence of}} nonlocal effects on the dielectric constant. Previous experiments using an AFM bi-layer cantilever reported near-field radiation heat transfer between a silica sphere and a flat plate down to a 30 nm gap. The objective of this thesis is to experimentally study thermal radiative transfer at very small separation distances. Experimental results on near-field radiation heat transfer between a silica sphere and a flat glass substrate are presented for sphere-plate separation down to a few nanometers. The experimental results deviate substantially from the theoretical predictions for separation distance of 100 nm and start to saturate at a separation distance of 30 nm. In addition to the effect of the spatial dispersion of the <b>dielectric</b> constant, this <b>saturation</b> may be influenced by the surface roughness of the microsphere and/or repulsive electrostatic forces.

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{practical}} experience of using coarse unbound granular materials is extensive, detailed knowledge on the mechanical and hydraulic behavior is {{to a large}} extent lacking. Regarding influence of water on mechanical properties, this is even more pronounced. The main objective of this work was to investigate the influence of water on behavior and properties of coarse granular materials. The study comprises measurements of resilient properties, soil-water characteristic curve and influence of water content on dielectric properties measured by the use of time domain reflectometry (TDR). The work described herein comprised two test series in terms of materials: firstly, a series where the grading was changed and secondly, a series where the influence of increased contents of free mica was studied. To measure resilient response, triaxial testing, using sample size of 500 mm diameter and 1000 mm height, was performed mainly using constant confining pressures. Tests were performed at incrementally varying water contents up to almost full <b>saturation.</b> <b>Dielectric</b> response and matric suction of compacted specimens were measured in a steel box at varying water content. Results from the first series indicated that the influence of water content on resilient properties depends on the material grading. The coarsest grading, containing least fines, experienced only a small reduction when brought close to saturation. Specimens with an increased amount of fines and more even distribution responded with a substantial loss of resilient modulus upon increased water content. It also appeared as water content increased, the specimens became more dilative. From the second series, generally, resilient modulus decreased with increased mica content and furthermore, elevated water contents caused reduction in stiffness. However, in relative terms, the reduction in resilient modulus caused by water decreased with increased mica content. The soil-water characteristic curves are influenced by grading coefficient and mica content; retentive capacity increases with decreased grading coefficient and increases with increased amount of mica. Volumetric water content as a function of apparent relative permittivity was fitted using a third-degree polynomial. Although, determined relationships deviated from Topp's (1980) relationship.

We identify three general categories of binary solvent mixtures, classified by the relative optical and static dielectric permittivities of the solvent components.

This procedure gives good quantitative agreement for larger ions, and reproduces key qualitative features, such as the shift to positive entropies of solvation for iodide and the shift to negative partial molar volumes for small cations. Small ions require a correction to account for <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> effects, which brings them also into good agreement with experiment. We argue that this model does not require ad hoc corrections, and uses parameters that have good external physical justification.

40|$|Electrokinetic {{transport}} {{behavior in}} nanochannels is different {{to that in}} larger sized channels. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in nanochannels have demonstrated two little understood phenomena which are not observed in microchannels, being: (i) the decrease of average electroosmotic mobility at high surface charge density, and (ii) the decrease of channel conductance at high salt concentrations, as the surface charge is increased. However, current electric double layer models do not capture these results. In this study we provide evidence that this inconsistency primarily arises from the neglect of the viscoelectric effect (being the increase of local viscosity near charged surfaces due to water molecule orientation) in conventional continuum models. It is shown that predictions of electroosmotic mobility in a slit nanochannel, derived from a viscoelectric-modified continuum model, are in quantitative agreement with previous MD simulation results. Furthermore, viscoelectric effects are found to dominate over ion steric and <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> effects in both electroosmotic and ion transport processes.

It is concluded that the mean field Poisson-Boltzmann approximation is often adequate to describe electrostatic effects in ionic systems particularly with monovalent counterions.

Saturation effects are least problematic, while the situation is unclear with respect to the local character of the dielectric response. As regards dielectric inhomogeneities there are clearly unsolved problems, particularly for the interfacial region. The force between zwitterionic surfaces is analysed in terms of a deviation from the asymptotic behaviour obtained by the Lifshitz theory.

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the solvation properties of a single water molecule in liquid water is carried out in two ways. In the first, the water molecule is placed in a cavity and the solvent is treated as a dielectric continuum.

In the second method, the solvent and solute molecules are treated explicitly in molecular dynamics simulations using Ewald boundary conditions. We find a 2 kcal/mole difference in solvation free energies predicted by these two methods when standard cavity radii are used. In addition, dielectric continuum theory assumes that the solvent reacts solely by realigning its electric moments linearly with the strength of the solute's electric field; the results of the molecular simulation show important non-linear effects. Non-linear solvent effects are generally of two types: <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation,</b> due to solvent-solute hydrogen bonds, and electrostriction, a decrease in the solute cavity due to an increased electrostatic interaction.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} is to {{quantify}} the effects of geologic heterogeneity on the dynamic process of CO 2 attenuation in shallow aquifers through the use of multi-scale laboratory experimentation and numerical modelling. First, an experiment was conducted in an intermediate scale two-dimensional cell that was packed with water-saturated porous media in a simple heterogeneous configuration. Constant-head boundary conditions were applied to the system, and then CO 2 -saturated water was injected through it. As the CO 2 -saturated water migrated through the system, gas phase CO 2 evolved within the porous media, as observed by <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> sensors. The outflow of CO 2 gas from the top of the system was monitored by a gas flow meter, and the outflow of water from the side of the tank was monitored via collection into a container that was placed on a computer-interfaced scale. After the multiphase CO 2 evolution appeared to have reached steady state, clean water was injected through the cell until all of the CO 2 was expelled from the system. In addition to the experiments, numerical models were performed using the Finite Element Heat and Mass transfer (FEHM) code as a first step toward planning larger scale experiments.

In the late 1970 s, Hubbard and Onsager predicted that adding salt ions to a polar solution {{would result in a}} reduced dielectric permittivity that arises from the unexpected tendency of solvent dipoles to align opposite to the applied field. So far, this effect has escaped an experimental verification, mainly because of the concomitant appearance of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> from which the Hubbard-Onsager decrement cannot be easily separated. Here we develop a novel non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation approach to determine this decrement accurately for the first time. Using a thermodynamic consistent all-atom force field we show that for an aqueous solution containing sodium chloride around 4. 8 Mol/l, this effect accounts for 12 % of the total dielectric permittivity. The dielectric decrement can be strikingly different if a less accurate force field for the ions is used. Using the widespread GROMOS parameters, we observe in fact an increment of the dielectric permittivity rather than a decrement. We can show that this increment is caused by ion pairing, introduced by a too low dispersion force, and clarify the microscopic connection between long-living ion pairs and the appearance of specific features in the dielectric spectrum of the solution...|$|E

We focus on the electrostatic influence that a channel-forming peptide may exert on energy barriers to ion permeation. The nonlinear dielectric behavior of channel water caused by <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> in the presence of an ion is explicitly modeled by assigning channel water a mean dielectric constant much less than that of bulk water. An exact solution of the continuum problem is formulated by approximating the dielectric behavior of bulk water, assigning it a dielectric constant of infinity. The validity of this approximation is verified by comparison with a Poisson-Boltzmann description of the electrolyte. The formal equivalence of high ionic strength and high electrolyte dielectric constant is demonstrated. We estimate limits on the reduction of the electrostatic free energy caused by ionic interaction with the channel-forming peptide. We find that even assigning this region an epsilon of 100, its influence is insufficient to lower permeation free energy barriers to values consistent with observed channel conductances. We provide estimates of the effective dielectric constant of this highly polarizable region, by comparing energy barriers computed using the continuum approach with those found from a semi-microscopic analysis of a simplified model of a gramicidin-like charge distribution.

When cycled under DC conditions, the maximum energy density measured for any of the capacitors tested here was ~ 4. 7 × 10 − 2 W-h/liter based on the volume of the dielectric material only. This corresponds to a specific energy of ~ 8 × 10 − 3 W-h/kg, again calculated on a dielectric-only basis. These results are compared to those reported by other authors and a simple theoretical treatment provided that quantifies the maximum energy that can be stored in these and similar devices {{as a function of}} dielectric strength and saturation polarization. Finally, a predictive model is developed to provide guidance on how to tailor the relative permittivities of high-k dielectrics in order to optimize their energy storage capacities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{explore the}} {{athermal}} effect of an external electrostatic {{field on the}} stabilities of protein conformations and the binding affinities of protein-protein/ligand interactions, the dependences of the polar and hydrophobic interactions on the external electrostatic field, −E ext, were studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By decomposing E ext into, along, and perpendicular to the direction formed by the two solutes, the effect of E ext on the interactions between these two solutes can be estimated based on the effects from these two components. E ext was applied along {{the direction of the}} electric dipole formed by two solutes with opposite charges. The attractive interaction free energy between these two solutes decreased for solutes treated as point charges. In contrast, the attractive interaction free energy between these two solutes increased, as observed by MD simulations, for E ext = 40 or 60 MV/cm. E ext was applied perpendicular to the direction of the electric dipole formed by these two solutes. The attractive interaction free energy was increased for E ext = 100 MV/cm as a result of <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation.</b> The force on the solutes along the direction of E ext computed from MD simulations was greater than that estimated from a continuum solvent in which the solutes were treated as point charges. To explore the hydrophobic interactions, E ext was applied to a water cluster containing two neutral solutes. The repulsive force between these solutes was decreased/increased for E ext along/perpendicular to the direction of the electric dipole formed by these two solutes...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory of}} {{electrostriction}} of solvent water near ions is developed. The treatment {{is based on}} a calculation of the effective pressure which would, {{in the absence of the}} field, cause the she change in volume as does the field. It is shown that when the dissolution process is from the crystalline phase, the electrostriction at small ions arises mainly on account of changes of effective volume of the solvent rather than from compression of the ion cavity in the dielectric. The change in solvent volume near ions can be related, using an appropriate molecular model, to the apparent change in the volume of the salt upon dissolution. This treatment avoids the difficulties of previous calculations where use of the Born equation involves an integration over a distance from the ion. Explicit approximate solutions for high-and low-field conditions, and a complete numerical solution for the effective pressure-field and field-volume relations are given. A method for calculation of the compressional entropy associated with hydration of ions is proposed on the basis of the above electrostriction calculations, taking into account <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> and pressure dependence of dielectric constant. Relations of the electrostatic contributions to the entropy of hydration of ions to corresponding volume changes are investigated and it is shown that the statistical mechanical method of Eley and Evans and the method of Laidler and Pegis, allowing for <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation,</b> give entropies of hydration that are in better agreement with experimental values. The partial molal volumes V¯ of a series of homologous tetraalkylammonium chlorides, bromides and iodides have been precisely measured by means of a differential buoyancy technique. The extrapolated values of V¯ to infinite dilution give V¯° data which are almost additive for successive homologues and enable the absolute individual partial g. ionic volumes of the halide ions to be estimated by a new principle to an accuracy of about 0. 5 ml. (g. ion) - 1. The anomalously large negative concentration dependence of V¯ is discussed in terms of mutual salting-in by the large cations and also salting-out due to the anion. Estimates of a and d ln a/dP are also made. Non-electrostatic effects arising from the large differences in size between the cations and the solvent molecules are suggested as one of the reasons for the anomalous activity coefficient and partial molal volume behaviour. It is concluded that the hydrophobic character of these ions exerts a strong structural influence on the solvent water, as indicated in other ways in previous publications. The partial molal volumes of some alkylamine hydrogen halides series have been studied with special reference to the role of solvation in the process of ionisation of methylammonium bases. It is shown that the change in volume associated with the ionisation is almost invariant as the degree of hydrophobic character of the cation is increased. The unexpected behaviour of DeltaS°, DeltaC p and DeltaV¯° is discussed in terms of structural influences upon the solvent by the different species. Partial molal adiabatic compressibility studies have been carried out on the homologous series of tetraalkylammonium bromides and iodides, methylammonium chlorides and methylamines. The extrapolated values of fKs to infinite dilution give f&j 0;Ks data which confirm the suspected structure promoting effect of these salts upon solvent water structure; these results complement those obtained from the partial molal volume studies...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{interactions}} of graphene with an electrolyte {{is fundamental to}} its applications for chemical and biological sensors, where graphene operates in the configuration of a field-effect transistor with its surface exposed to liquid containing mobile ions. By applying a gate potential through an electrolyte one may achieve a control of graphene’s conductivity that is extremely sensitive {{to the presence of}} adsorbed molecules, ion concentration, or the pH in an aqueous solution. In addition, charged impurities in the oxide layer underneath graphene also affect its conductivity by causing fluctuations of the scattering potential for charge carriers in graphene. Since the gate potential used for graphene doping in such applications is usually large, it is necessary to consider nonlinear effects in the equilibrium doping of graphene using a full density of states for its π-electron bands, while in the electrolyte it is necessary to assess the effects due to finite size of ions and <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> of water near highly doped graphene. We first explore the capacitance of a graphene-electrolyte interface using well established continuum models from electrochemistry that generalize the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory: the Bikerman model for steric effects due to ion size and the Booth model for <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation.</b> Next, we develop a model to describe the screening of the electrostatic potential that arises in the plane of graphene due to charged impurities in the oxide. For the polarizability of charge carriers in graphene we explore two models, one based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation and the other based on the Random Phase approximation for graphene’s π-electron bands in the Dirac cone approximation. On the other hand, the ion distribution in the electrolyte is described by a fully linearized PB model known as Debye-Hückel PB (DHPB) model, which is suitable for a low gating potential, as well as by a partially linearized PB (PLPB) model, which contains full information on the equilibrium gating conditions of graphene. The screened potential due to charged impurities is described by a dielectric response formulation of the problem, which is derived from the Green’s function for the Poisson equation for the entire structure containing graphene. Statistical properties of the fluctuations in the potential are analyzed by means of its autocorrelation function, which is expressed in terms of a structure factor for the geometric positions of charged impurities in the oxide. We have found that for the gate potentials up to ≈ 1 V, which are of interest in most graphene applications, the total capacitance is dominated by the quantum capacitance of graphene. Moreover, we have found that the capacitance of the electric double layer in the electrolyte may be adequately described for the same range of gate potentials up to ≈ 1 V by using the PB model in its standard, nonlinear form, without the need of additional modifications. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the PLPB model yields the doping density of graphene and the potential drop across the diffuse layer, with better accuracy and in a broader range of values of the external parameters than the DHPB model. We have found that both the DHPB and the PLPB models exhibit a very weak dependence on ion concentration for both the auto-correlation and variance of the potential when compared to the uncorrelated charged impurities. Last but not least, results reported in this thesis are geared towards the first stage of a long-term undertaking to develop a comprehensive and computational model for biological and chemical sensors in the context of graphene based field-effect transistors. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|The {{solvation}} dynamics {{associated with}} the ionization of N, N‐dimethylaniline (DMA) in water and methanol solutions has been studied theoretically. Potential energy surfaces of DMA and DMA[+] were computed by a b i n i t i o molecular orbital (MO) methods. Intermolecular pair potential functions between DMA and H 2 O were developed {{with the aid of}} the electron distributions of DMA and H 2 O and the results of MO calculations for the DMA–H 2 O system. Potential functions between DMA and MeOH were also determined empirically using the parameters for DMA–H 2 O interaction. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics calculations were carried out for the DMA–water and DMA–methanol solutions. The simulation results were analyzed comparing two solvents in order to obtain a realistic molecular model for the solvation dynamics of DMA in polar solvents. The solvation coordinate was defined by the potential energy difference between neutral and cation states and free energy curves along it were constructed using the umbrella sampling method. They were found to be well described by parabolas and nonlinear effects such as the <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> were not observed. The fluctuation–dissipation relation was also examined. It was found that the present systems follow the linear response to a reasonable approximation. In order to provide a kinematic foundation for the choice of the solvation coordinate, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the motion along the solvation coordinate is derived utilizing the reaction path model originally developed to describe photochemical processes in the gas phase. The mechanism of the dielectric relaxationdynamics was discussed {{on the basis of the}} quantities in the GLE deduced from the molecular dynamics (MD) calculations...|$|E
40|$|In {{our recent}} work, J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 138, 154712, we {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} unidirectional pumping of water, exploiting translational- rotational momentum coupling using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Flow can be sustained when the fluid is driven out of equilibrium by an external spatially uniform rotating electric field and confined between two planar surfaces exposing different degrees of hydrophobicity. The permanent dipole moment of water follows the rotating field, thus inducing the molecules to spin, and the torque exerted by the field is continuously injected into the fluid, enabling a steady conversion of spin angular momentum into linear momentum. The translational-rotational coupling is a sensitive function of the rotating electric field parameters. In this work, {{we have found that}} there exists a small energy dissipation region attainable when the frequency of the rotating electric field matches the inverse of the dielectric relaxation time of water and when its amplitude lies in a range just before <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> effects take place. In this region, that is, when the frequency lies in a small window of the microwave region around 20 GHz and amplitude 0. 03 V - 1, the translational-rotational coupling is most effective, yielding fluid velocities of magnitudes of 2 ms- 1 with only moderate fluid heating. In this work, we also confine water to a realistic nanochannel made of graphene giving a hydrophobic surface on one side and -cristobalite giving a hydrophilic surface on the other, reproducing slip-and-stick velocity boundary conditions, respectively. This enables us to demonstrate that in a realistic environment, the coupling can be effectively exploited to achieve noncontact pumping of water at the nanoscale. A quantitative comparison between nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and analytical solutions of the extended Navier-Stokes equations, including an external rotating electric field has been performed, showing excellent agreement when the electric field parameters match the aforementioned small energy dissipation region...|$|E
40|$|The venerable {{theory of}} {{electrokinetic}} phenomena {{rests on the}} hypothesis of a dilute solution of point-like ions in quasi-equilibrium with a weakly charged surface, whose potential relative to the bulk is of order the thermal voltage (kT/e ≈ 25 mV at room temperature). In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC or induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge electrophoresis (ICEP), several V ≈ 100 kT/e are applied to polarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric fields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions of the classical theory. In this article, we review the experimental and theoretical literatures, highlight discrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications of the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, {{in response to a}} large applied voltage, the “compact layer” and “shear plane” effectively advance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counterions. Using simple continuum models, we predict two general trends at large voltages: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse double layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a charge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic mobility; each trend is enhanced by <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation.</b> The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in ACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing salt concentration. Through several colloidal examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere in an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena are generally ion-specific. Similar theoretical issues arise in nanofluidics (due to confinement) and ionic liquids (due to the lack of solvent), so the paper concludes with a general framework of modified electrokinetic equations for finite-sized ions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} construction and application of novel accurate continuum theories to various many-body problems in condensed matter systems. We begin {{with the construction of}} a new "classical" density-functional theory for general molecular liquids which is based on an exact evaluation of the free energy of a noninteracting molecular gas. By adding terms which capture intermolecular interactions, we arrive at a theory which reproduces both the linear and nonlinear dielectric response of the liquid, the experimental correlation functions of the uniform phase and various thermodynamic properties, such as the surface tension or liquid-vapor coexistence. We then apply our "classical" density-functional theory to the liquid of greatest importance, water. We introduce new computational techniques for efficient evaluation of the free energy of noninteracting water molecules and apply the resulting theory to the study of liquid water at solid surfaces. In strong electric fields, we observe <b>dielectric</b> <b>saturation</b> in good agreement with previously published molecular dynamics calculations. Next, we introduce a new, joint time-dependent density-functional theory for the description of dissolved electronic systems in time-dependent external potentials. Starting from the exact action functional for electrons and nuclei of both the solute and the solvent, we systematically eliminate solvent degrees of freedom and finally arrive at a coarse-grained action functional which retains the detailed ab initio description only for the solute electrons while treating the solvent with an approximate continuum theory. We apply this theory to study electronic excitations of formaldehyde in aqueous solution and find good agreement between our predictions and experimental findings. Finally, we examine phonon-phonon interactions in carbon nanotubes using an elastic continuum theory with elastic constants obtained from ab initio calculations. The resulting theory allows us to predict intrinsic quality factors of the fundamental flexural mode for tubes of different lengths and radii, but also for different temperatures and strains. We find that the intrinsic quality factor at room temperature is about one order of magnitude higher than current experimental findings, indicating that there remains room for improvement in current devices. We also explore the possibility of carbon nanotube mass sensors with single yoctogram precision...|$|E
