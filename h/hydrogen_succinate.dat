However, the optimum concentration of malathion which supported the maximum bacterial growth was found to be 22. 8 mg/ml.

Respiratory activities determined with membrane vesicles were 50 - to 100 -fold higher with formate and <b>hydrogen</b> than with <b>succinate,</b> lactate, malate, or NADH as substrates. Evidence for three terminal respiratory components was obtained from respiratory kinetic studies employing cyanide, and the following Ki values for cyanide were determined from Dixon plots: ascorbate + reduced N,N,N', N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, K 1 + 3. 5 muM; malate, K 1 = 55 muM; and hydrogen, K 1 = 4. 5 muM. Two oxidases (K 1 = 90 muM, 4. 5 mM) participated in the oxidation of succinate, lactate, and formate. Except with formate, 37 muM HQNO inhibited respiration by approximately 50 %. Carbon monoxide had little inhibitory effect on respiration except under low oxygen tension (less than 10 % air saturation). The stoichiometry of respiratory-driven proton translocation (H+/O) determined with whole cells was approximately 2 for all substrates examined except hydrogen (H+/) = 3. 7) and formate (H+/O = 2. 5).

R. rubrum and R. capsulata were also capable of growing strictly through anaerobic, respiratory mechanisms. Nonfermentable substrates, such as succinate, malate, or acetate, supported growth only in the presence of an electron acceptor such as dimethyl sulfoxide or trimethylamine oxide. Carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide were produced during growth of R. rubrum and R. capsulata on succinate plus dimethyl sulfoxide. Molar growth yields from cultures grown anaerobically in the dark on fructose plus dimethyl sulfoxide were 3. 8 to 4. 6 times higher than values obtained from growth on fructose alone and were 56 to 60 % of the values obtained from aerobic, respiratory growth with fructose. Likewise, molar growth yields from anaerobic, respiratory growth conditions with succinate plus dimethyl sulfoxide were 51 to 54 % of the values obtained from aerobic, respiratory growth with succinate.

Subjects were divided into two balanced groups receiving placebo or 400 mg BAHS before sleep for a 6 -month period. Basal sleep did not differ substantially in the two groups, both presenting reduced REM sleep. Low amounts of REM sleep were partially reversed by BAHS administration, which caused {{a significant increase in the}} REM sleep stage. Post-treatment sleep modifications found in the experimental group were not observed in the control group. BAHS produced its effects on REM sleep immediately after the first administration of the drug, but they became more apparent after long-term treatment. Our findings indicate that long-term administration of BAHS at low dosage maintains its effects on REM sleep of mentally retarded children, causing modifications similar to those previously obtained with single administration at higher dosages in cats, in healthy young and elderly volunteers and in Down's syndrome children. In addition, our observations demonstrate the effectiveness of BAHS on REM sleep, when utilized in mental retardation of etiologies other than Down's syndrome...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>succinate</b> (SHS), an alkali metallo-organic third order NLO single {{crystals}} {{were grown}} successfully using aqueous solution by slow evaporation technique at room temperature. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis {{reveals that the}} grown crystal belongs to monoclinic system with space group C 2 /c. The presence of sodium in the title compound was confirmed by ICP-OES analysis. The existence of proton and carbon peak in the material was detected using NMR analysis. Using optical absorption studies, the theoretical calculations such as refractive index, reflectance, electrical conductivity, electrical susceptibility and optical conductivity of SHS were determined. The mechanical properties like brittleness index, fracture toughness, yield strength and elastic stiffness coefficient were estimated using Vickers microhardness test. The ac, dc conductivity and activation energy of SHS were also found using dielectric studies at different temperatures. Introduction. The recent developments {{in the field of}} optoelectronics and photonics has made most of the researchers to identify novel materials with most efficient NLO features like second and third order harmonics as per their requirements on the hyperpolarizabilities of molecules [1]. At present large quantity of organic compounds has been materialized as a favorable third order NLO material with large optical susceptibilities, ultrafast response times and high optical threshold for laser power. Organic materials have huge range of remarkable properties and it is more superior to inorganic materials due to π conjugation between electron donor and acceptor groups, chirality and hydrogen bonding. The acceptor-donor groups are commonly attached to organic conjugated systems to produce NLO materials with large hyperpolarizabilities and to mold their transparency [2]...|$|E
40|$|Five {{anaerobic}} fungal isolates {{from the}} bovine rumen were grown on Coastal Bermuda grass (CBG) leaf blades and monitored over a 9 -day period for substrate utilization, fermentation products, cellulase, and xylanase activities. Two of the fungal isolates showed monocentric growth patterns; one (isolate MC- 1) had monoflagellated zoospores and morphologically resembled {{members of the}} genus Piromyces; the other (isolate MC- 2) had multiflagellated zoospores and resembled members of the genus Neocallimastix. Three other isolates (PC- 1, PC- 2, and PC- 3) exhibited polycentric growth and {{have not yet been}} described in the literature; these isolates were characterized by differences in morphology. All of the isolates degraded CBG to approximately the same extent (70 % [dry weight]) in 9 days. Fermentation product accumulation was concurrent with substrate utilization. The major fermentation products for all isolates were formate, acetate, D-(-) -lactate, L-(+) -lactate, ethanol, carbon dioxide, and <b>hydrogen.</b> <b>Succinate</b> was produced by all cultures, with the exception of MC- 1. Fermentation balances revealed different profiles for each isolate. As a group, monocentric isolates produced a greater ratio of oxidized to reduced products when grown on glucose or CBG than did the polycentric isolates, which produced a nearly equal ratio of these products. All isolates exhibited cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities, including endoglucanase, exoglucanase, beta-glucosidase, xylanase, and beta-xylosidase activities. Increasing enzyme activity correlated with the accumulation of fermentation products and substrate utilization. The optimum pH for the enzymatic activity of polycentric isolates was within a more narrow range (pH 6. 4 to 7. 0) than that of the monocentric isolates (pH 5. 5 to 7. 5). Activity toward cellulosic substrates was not detected until after the disappearance of reducing sugars. Xylanase activity was found to be five to seven times that of carboxymethyl cellulase activity for all cultures grown on CBG...|$|E
