5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in <b>his</b> <b>ankle.</b> An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in <b>his</b> <b>ankle.</b> Kemp was told that if he kept playing <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an articular talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test of {{the series}} at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> slipped in a {{footmark}} during the first innings and a bone was chipped.

This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. He appeared to have damaged <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière up front.|$|E

5|$|Coulson was {{released}} by Barnsley {{at the end of}} the season, leaving him free to join Grimsby permanently, signing a two-year contract on 31 May 2010. In the third match of 2010–11, at home to Hayes & Yeading United on 21 August 2010, he took a kick to <b>his</b> <b>ankle,</b> which was expected to keep him out of the team for a month. He returned on 18 September 2010 after starting in a 2–1 defeat at home to Fleetwood Town, but was substituted at half-time. Coulson made a goalscoring second comeback from <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> injury in Grimsby's 2–2 home draw with Eastbourne Borough on 30 October 2010. For the first time as a Grimsby player he scored twice in one match in a 2–1 victory at home to AFC Wimbledon on 5 March 2011, with a first-half shot into the bottom left of the goal and a second-half shot into the top-left corner from inside the penalty area. Coulson's first season as a permanent Grimsby player concluded having scored nine goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they dropped into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> injury.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable {{for the fact that}} he was the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an ankle injury in the previous match, and was not expected (or advised) to play. He started the final and was taken off before half time. During the break, and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to <b>his</b> <b>ankle,</b> including pain-killing injections.|$|E

5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> after {{tangling}} with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{had very}} few {{problems}} affecting the roster. Only one defensive starter missed a game due to injury. On offense, starting running back Selvin Young injured <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> {{in the game}} against Louisiana-Lafayette and re-injured it the following week against Ohio State. He did not play in the games against Rice or Baylor. Receiver Jordan Shipley missed the entire season due to a pulled hamstring.|$|E

Senior Tech running back Mike Imoh, who shared time running the ball during the regular season with Ore and Humes, was also out after {{undergoing}} surgery to repair an injured ankle. Adding to the injury situation for Virginia Tech was offensive tackle Jimmy Martin, who suffered a sprained knee ligament in practice leading up to the game. Martin started 45consecutive games prior to the Gator Bowl, a streak that was broken when he was replaced by Brandon Frye on the day of the game.|$|E
5|$|Baroš broke <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> in a September 2003 {{match against}} Blackburn Rovers, a match which also saw {{teammate}} Jamie Carragher sustain a broken leg. Baroš subsequently missed {{five months of}} football and scored just two goals in the 2003–04 season. His first goal came in a league match against Leeds United in February 2004, while his other goal was in March in a 1–1 Champions League draw against Marseille. Baroš would later claim that had manager Gérard Houllier stayed at the club after the summer of 2004, he would have put in a transfer request. As it was, Houllier left the club {{and was replaced by}} Rafael Benítez.|$|E

Wes Brown, Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all doubts for the final, after they had picked up knocks in the week before the final. They would also be without striker Diego Forlán, who had injured <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> against Juventus, however, defender Mikaël Silvestre was declared fit to start.|$|E

5|$|Burgmeier injured <b>his</b> <b>ankle</b> at {{the start}} of the 2007–08 season, and after playing only four league games, Thun signed him on a six-month loan deal in January 2008.
