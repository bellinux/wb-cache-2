By adjusting the delay time of repeller pulse, {{it is able to}} ignore significantly the background argon ions prior to the repelling of analytical ion pulse due to the repelled ion beam orthogonalized to the extracted ion beam, such that mass spectra are characterized by high discrimination against discharge gas species. The short-term relative standard deviation of 2. 2 % is achieved with 5 -minute interval, which is found mainly up to the stability of discharge pressure.

The technique is based on isotope dilution and was first described in the 1950 s using radioactive C- 14 -labelled cholic acid (CA). It took until the 1970 s before stable isotopes were introduced for this purpose (C- 13, H- 2) and isotope analysis methods were developed for CA and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) applying gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry. Until the 1980 s, the isotope enrichment measurements were performed in bile samples aspirated from the duodenum. Thereafter, methodology became available allowing measurements to be performed in blood requiring at least 2 ml serum samples. Simultaneous measurement of kinetics of metabolically dependent CA and deoxycholic acid using C- 13 and H- 2 labels was introduced. Until the 1990 s, this technique was only possible in adult humans due to the large sample sizes. Introduction of pentafluorobenzyl bromide derivatisation and electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry (GC/ECN-MS) reduced the sample volume to 50 mu l serum. This allowed <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>measurement</b> of CA in rats and in mice. However, repetitive collection of 100 mu l blood samples in mice is too invasive (collection via the orbita) and exhaustive. Therefore, the method development is now focussing on enhanced sensitivity and reduction of blank effects originating from the sample preparation. The final goal is to determine CA isotope enrichments in 20 mu l mouse blood obtained from the tail vein. This paper shows the feasibility of reaching this goal...|$|E

We explore the laser parameters critical to the ionization process and their effects on the measured isotope ratio. Specifically, the use of broad bandwidth lasers with automated feedback control of wavelength was applied to the measurement of {sup 235 }U/{sup 238 }U ratios to decrease laser-induced isotopic fractionation. By broadening the bandwidth of the first laser in a 3 -color, 3 -photon ionization process from a bandwidth of 1. 8 GHz to about 10 GHz, the variation in sequential relative <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>measurements</b> decreased from > 10 % to less than 0. 5 %.

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{selenium}} {{in the environment}} will be a prominent water quality issue in the western United States for many years. Selenium accumulation is linked to increased rates of death and deformity in migratory birds, blind staggers in livestock, and selenosis in humans. In California, agricultural drain waters and oil refinery effluent contribute to high selenium content in the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay. The importance of these industries to California`s economy precludes simple abatement, while the complexity of selenium cycling precludes simple remediation. The purpose of this project is to measure variations in the isotopic composition of selenium in water and soil samples caused by natural processes and to show, for the first time, the value of isotopic measurements in characterizing selenium pollution. The research seeks to identify sources of selenium pollution, determine processes in the selenium cycle, and support selenium remediation studies. The project required the successful integration of three components: (1) appropriate sampling a field setting showing Se enrichment and possibly isotopic fractionation, (2) analytical chemical methods for isolating and purifying the various species of Se in waters and sediment, and (3) mass spectroscopic instrumentation for high precision <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

Presently, no methodologies {{are available to}} measure synthesis rates of individual mitochondrial proteins, which limits our ability to fully understand the translational regulation of gene transcripts. Here, we report a methodology to measure synthesis rates of multiple muscle mitochondrial proteins, which, along with large-scale measurements of mitochondrial gene transcripts and protein concentrations, {{will enable us to}} determine whether mitochondrial alteration is due to transcriptional or translational changes.

40|$|The {{nuclear fission}} of {{actinides}} in reactor fuel produces {{large quantities of}} Kr and Xe as fission products. Because of {{the high levels of}} fission Kr and Xe, sample collection and analysis of noble gases for spent fuel diagnostic measurements is a simple, straight-forward technique. In modern reprocessing plants with continuous dissolvers, it will not be possible to use traditional methods for isolating input batches of fuel. This study investigates the feasibility of using noble gas <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>measurements</b> (<b>isotope</b> correlation techniques - ICT) to solve safeguards requirements. Noble gas measurements might be able to provide an independent analysis of Pu contained within dissolves fuel, on an individual fuel assembly basis. The isotopic composition of Kr and Xe in spent fuel reflects both the composition (<b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> ratios) of the fission products and the effects of neutron capture on those fission products. We have reviewed the available literature for noble gas analyses of spent reactor fuel. While references are made to noble gas isotope correlations over the last 20 years, we have found little if any detailed analysis of large data sets. The literature search did find several useful reports. Of these papers, one is particularly useful for evaluating noble gas isotopic compositions. The ``Benchmark-paper`` (1) contains 54 Kr and 56 Xe isotopic composition analyses for 4 different reactors with a variety of fuel enrichment factors. Burnup ranges from 8000 to 37000 MWd/tU.

40|$|Conventional {{simultaneous}} CNS stable <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>measurements</b> {{of solid}} samples usually require high sample amounts, up to 1 mg carbon, to achieve exact analytical results. This rarely used application is often impaired by high C:S element ratios when organic samples are analyzed and {{problems such as}} incomplete conversion into sulphur dioxide occur during analysis. We introduce, as a technical innovation, a high sensitivity elemental analyzer coupled to a conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometer, with which CNS-stable isotope ratios can be determined simultaneously in samples with low carbon content (< 40 mu g C corresponding to similar to 100 mu g dry weight). The system includes downsized reactors, a temperature program-controlled gas chromatography (GC) column and a cryogenic trap to collect small amounts of sulphur dioxide. This modified application allows for highly sensitive measurements in a fully automated operation with standard deviations better than +/- 0. 47 parts per thousand for delta N- 15 and delta S- 34 and +/- 0. 12 parts per thousand for delta C- 13 (n= 127). Samples collected from one sampling site in a Baltic fjord {{within a short time}} period were measured with the new system to get a first impression of triple stable isotope signatures. The results confirm the potential of using delta S- 34 as a stable isotope tracer in combination with delta N- 15 and delta C- 13 measurements to improve discrimination of food sources in aquatic food webs.

Depending on the dead time of each component in the signal chain, the electronically determined result may not represent the true value for the total system, i. e., {{there might be a}} series of hardware related dead times. However, a hardware set artificial dead time in the pulse counting system that is long enough might yield a system dead time that can be represented by this set dead time solely. It is shown in this work that a carefully chosen, artificially introduced set dead time yields a system that may be characterized to a much lower uncertainty than is possible using ratio-based measurement approaches. Ultimately, the impact of the dead time on the combined uncertainty of an <b>isotope</b> <b>abundance</b> ratio <b>measurement</b> may be negligible even at very high count rates, i. e., > 1 Mcps.

Growth of raft-cultivated Gracilaria gracilis in Saldanha Bay {{is known to be}} badly affected in late summer due to the persistence of warm oligotrophic water at the ocean surface which prevents replenishment of nutrients by upwelling. This study documents the extent of nitrogen starvation during this period and investigates some possible methods of managing this problem. Nitrogen content, C:N ratio and stable <b>isotope</b> <b>abundances</b> of C and N were obtained for material grown for varying lengths of time, material grown at various depths and material that had been fertilized prior to placement on the raft. The relationship between thallus colour and nitrogen content was also documented using a standard colour guide. The onset of nitrogen starvation was rapid, occurring after about two weeks on the raft. Growth was optimized about a meter below the water surface, possibly as a result of photoinhibition of photosynthesis at the surface. Nitrogen limitation ceased below about 2 m growth depth. Prefertilization had no significant effect on yield after 4 weeks growth. Thallus colour showed a clear relationship with N content and may be a useful indicator of N status of cultivated Gracilaria. δ¹⁵N was related to N content and increased rapidly when N limitation was removed.

Recent geochemical and biological efforts have led to {{a significant increase in the}} estimated input of nitrogen to marine ecosystems by biological fixation, while molecular studies have increased our knowledge of the number and diversity of nitrogen fixers known to be active in the ocean. Although Trichodesmium spp. have long been viewed as the primary marine nitrogen fixers, recent efforts have shown that various members of the picoplankton community are also actively involved in nitrogen fixation. The relative abundance of different nitrogen fixers is an important ecosystem parameter since nitrogen fixers may differ significantly in their physiology, life history and ecology. Here we combine rate measurements and stable <b>isotope</b> natural <b>abundance</b> <b>measurements</b> to constrain the impact of N 2 fixation in the waters north of Australia. Samples were collected in the Coral, Arafura, and East Timor Seas, thus spanning three distinct hydrographic regions. Our data show that Trichodesmium has a significant influence on the stable nitrogen isotope ratios of particulate and zooplankton biomass and suggest that Trichodesmium is a significant source of nitrogen for the pelagic ecosystem. Based on stable carbon isotope ratios, it is also likely that the pathways are indirect and nitrogen fixed by Trichodesmium enters the higher trophic levels via decomposition as dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen. Picocyanobacteria showed high diazotrophic activity at some stations, but unlike Trichodesmium, their N 2 fixation rate was not reflected in the stable N isotope ratios of particulate and zooplankton biomass.
