5|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy's {{attacks on}} the Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> ships to home waters, to protect the Australian {{mainland}} from Japanese attack, while several smaller ships remained in the Mediterranean. From 1940 onwards, there was considerable Axis naval activity in Australian waters first from German commerce raiders and submarines and later by the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
5|$|An {{open-source}} {{adaptation of}} Garamond intended for display sizes, designed by Christian Thalmann and co-released with Google Fonts. It features a delicate style suitable for printing at larger sizes, and considerable contrast in stroke weight in <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> sizes. Thalmann added several unusual alternate designs {{such as an}} upright italic and unicase styles, as well as exaggerated, highly slanting accents.|$|E
5|$|Leccinellum albellum {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.holopus, but grows in association with oak and has a more southerly distribution. L.scabrum is a widely distributed lookalike that can be distinguished from L.holopus by <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size and generally darker colors.|$|E

5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{neighbouring}} {{counties in}} the English Midlands. Rutland is the smallest county in England and its administration was amalgamated with <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> neighbour between 1974 and 1997.

5|$|Originally {{placed in}} the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs), the giant mouse lemur was moved to its own genus, Mirza, in 1985 due to <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size, {{morphological}} differences, dental characteristics, and behavior.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{resistance}} to oxidation exhibited by silicon carbide, {{as well as the}} discovery of new ways to synthesize the cubic β-SiC form, with <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> surface area, has led to significant interest in its use as a heterogeneous catalyst support. This form has already been employed as a catalyst support for the oxidation of hydrocarbons, such as n-butane, to maleic anhydride.|$|E

5000|$|Wudaokou is {{also known}} for <b>its</b> <b>large</b> number of {{international}} students. Wudaokou's popularity as an international student area is reflected in <b>its</b> <b>large</b> number of [...] bars and nightclubs (including Wu Club, Global Club, Sugar Shack, Lush, Sensation and Propaganda), which generally offer cheaper prices than many similar clubs in more central areas, such as Sanlitun. The Wudaokou area is also notable for <b>its</b> <b>large</b> number of Koreans, with many signs in Korean advertising businesses, restaurants and bars located within its vicinity. Korean students make up the largest foreign student population.|$|R
5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|Boletus caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> spores, which have been reported to be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|Following the Munster {{match the}} All Blacks {{returned}} to England. Due to <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> capacity, {{the game was}} played at Crystal Palace (which had an official capacity of 50,000) rather than Blackheath. Despite the official capacity, it is estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 people attended the match; many of them non-paying spectators. The 100,000 spectators, including the Prince of Wales (the future King George V), was a record for a rugby or football match in London.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea {{is known}} from three mandibles (lower jaws)—one, the holotype, with the fourth premolar (p4) {{and all three}} molars (m1–3) preserved; one with the incisor and m2; and one with the incisor, p4, m1, and m2—an {{isolated}} lower incisor, and an isolated m2. It was large for a squirrel, and can be distinguished from the fossil squirrels Palaeosciurus, Aliveria, and Ratufa obtusidens by <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon is {{represented}} in the fossil record by teeth, vertebral centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the jaws of megalodon {{would have been more}} massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than that of the great white. Its fins were proportional to <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E

5|$|The Schiavo case {{involved}} 14 appeals and numerous motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at {{the levels of}} the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the pro-life movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo's death, both {{her husband and her}} family have written books on their sides of the case, and both have also been involved in activism over <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by <b>its</b> <b>larger</b> size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
