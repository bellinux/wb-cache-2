5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of the}} most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England.

This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Henry Huxley {{was born}} in Ealing, which was then a village in Middlesex. He was the second {{youngest}} of eight children of George Huxley and Rachel Withers.

25|$|In 1882, Moore {{sold the}} Gertrude {{and built the}} Pacific Slope, {{but by the end}} of the year, he had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> <b>times</b> again and sold the Pacific Slope to Andrew Onderdonk and {{declared}} bankruptcy again, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Western Slope at auction, and being a man of great honor, hired Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent. William Moore, now 60, was hardly ready to become an employee of his old rival's 28-year-old son, so he built another sternwheeler, the Teaser, which was eventually seized by creditors (despite Billie's attempt to hide her in Alaska), and sold and renamed the Rainbow.|$|E

25|$|The 1969 Ohio State vs. Michigan {{football}} game {{is considered to}} be one of the best-known games of the series, as well as one of the biggest upsets in college football history. The Buckeyes went into the game as the top-ranked team in the country, with a 22-game winning streak under the direction of legendary head coach Woody Hayes. They were also defending national champions. The Wolverines went into the game under a new head coach, Bo Schembechler, who was trying to redefine a college football power that had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> <b>times.</b> Ohio State was playing for its second straight national title, while Michigan was playing for the Rose Bowl, and the championship of the Big Ten Conference was on the line. The game was witnessed by a (then) stadium-record crowd of 103,588 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, and began the highly combative stretch of the rivalry informally known as The Ten Year War.|$|E
25|$|The day Channel 4 began {{operations}} in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based Brookside, which would redefine soaps {{over the next}} decade. The focus of Brookside was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike Coronation Street and Emmerdale Farm, which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in Brookside were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> <b>times.</b> Though Brookside was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.|$|E
25|$|Marius {{found that}} {{ending the war}} was more {{difficult}} than he had claimed. He arrived comparatively late in 107 BC and in that year and the next he forced Jugurtha {{to the south and}} west toward Mauretania. Marius' quaestor in 107 BC had been Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, the son of a patrician family that had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> <b>times.</b> Marius was supposedly unhappy at receiving the dissolute youth as his subordinate, but Sulla proved a competent military leader. By 105 the king of Mauretania, Bocchus I, who was also Jugurtha's father-in-law and reluctant ally, was worried about the approaching Romans. After receiving word that an accommodation with them was possible, Bocchus insisted that Sulla make the hazardous journey to his capital, where Sulla induced Bocchus to betray Jugurtha, who was duly handed over to Sulla, thus ending the war. Since Marius held the imperium and Sulla was acting as his subordinate, the honor of capturing Jugurtha belonged strictly to Marius, but Sulla had clearly been immediately responsible and had a signet ring made for himself commemorating the event. Sulla would later claim that the credit for ending the war was his. Meanwhile, Marius was the hero of the hour, and his services would be needed in another emergency.|$|E

5000|$|By 1966 {{the theater}} began to <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> <b>hard</b> <b>times.</b> Over the years, the fare changed from {{legitimate}} theater, to rock concerts, to boxing matches, until in 1980 {{it became a}} Jehovah's Witness Regional Assembly Hall. By 2004, the church had outgrown the facility and sold the property, which it had bought for $1 million, to the developer JPI for $30 million.|$|R
