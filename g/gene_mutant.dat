50|$|Zhang et al. hypothesize that, if survivin is a {{significant}} contributor {{to the development of}} hormonal therapy resistance in prostate cancer cells, targeting survivin and blocking it would enhance prostate cancer cell susceptibility to anti-androgen therapy. The basis of anti-androgen therapy involves using drugs that eliminate the presence of androgens in the cell and cellular environment, since the presence of androgens are known to enhance tumour immortality in prostate cancer cells. Zhang et al. first assessed the level of survivin expression of LNCaP (an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line that expresses intact androgen receptors) using quantitative Western analysis and found high expression of survivin in these cells. Cells exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), an exogenous androgen, showed increased levels of survivin expression only and not other IAP family members. This result implicates that androgens in the physiological context may upregulate survivin, which contributes to the resistance of apoptosis observed in the tumour cells. Next, with the addition of Flutamide(an antiandrogen) to the cells, survivin levels were observed to significantly decrease. The LNCaP cells were transduced separately with the different constructs of the survivin <b>gene</b> (<b>mutant</b> or wild-type) and subjected to Flutamide treatment and assessed for the apoptosis level. Flutamide-treated survivin mutant-transduced cells were shown to significantly increase apoptosis by double that of Flutamide treatment alone. On the other end, overexpression of the wild-type survivin was found to significantly reduce the apoptosis levels from Flutamide treatment compared to Flutamide treatment alone. Therefore, these results support the hypothesis that asserts that survivin does play a role in contributing the anti-apoptotic nature of the LNCaP cancer cell line and that inhibiting survivin in prostate cancer cells does appear to enhance the therapeutic effect of Flutamide.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} aging can be {{described}} as a progressive decline in an organism’s function that invariably results in death. This decline results from the activities of intrinsic genetic factors within an organism. The relative contributions of the biological and environmental components to senescence are hard to measure, however different strategies have been devised in Drosophila melanogaster to isolate and identify genetic influences on aging. These strategies include selective breeding, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and single <b>gene</b> <b>mutant</b> analysis. Selective breeding effectively demonstrated a genetic, heritable component to aging while QTL mapping located regions within the Drosophila genome carrying loci that influence the aging process.

40|$|Prevention of the {{initiation}} of biofilm formation {{is the most important}} step for combating biofilm-associated pathogens, as the ability of pathogens to resist antibiotics is enhanced 10 to 1000 times once biofilms are formed. Genes essential to bacterial growth in the planktonic state are potential targets to treat biofilm-associated pathogens. However, the biofilm formation capability of strains with mutations in these essential genes must be evaluated, since the pathogen might form a biofilm before it is eliminated. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a systems-level approach to quantifying the biofilm formation capability of mutants to determine target genes that are essential for bacterial metabolism in the planktonic state but do not induce biofilm formation in their mutants. The changes of fluxes through the reactions associated with the genes positively related to biofilm formation are used as soft sensors in the flux balance analysis to quantify the trend of biofilm formation upon the mutation of an essential gene. The essential <b>genes</b> whose <b>mutants</b> are predicted not to induce biofilm formation are regarded as gene targets. The proposed approach was applied to identify target genes to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.

We resolved nuclear types from multinuclear mycelium of a phenotypically normal wild isolate of the fungus Neurospora intermedia by plating its uninucleate microconidia and obtained a strain which, unlike the “parent” strain, exhibited clonal senescence in subcultures. The mutant gene, senescent, was introgressed into N. crassa and mapped four map units {{to the right of}} the his- 1 locus on linkage group VR. senescent is the first nuclear <b>gene</b> <b>mutant</b> of Neurospora derived from nature that shows the death phenotype. Death of the sen mutant occurred faster at $ 34 ^o C$ than at 22 or $ 26 ^o C$. Measurements of oxygen uptake of conidia using respiratory inhibitors and the spectrophotometric analyses of mitochondrial cytochromes showed that in sen cultures grown at $ 34 ^o C$, cytochromes b and $aa_ 3 $ were present but cytochrome c was absent. By contrast at $ 26 ^o C$, cytochromes b and c were present but cytochrome $aa_ 3 $ was diminished in the late subcultures. This suggested that the sen mutation does not affect the potential to produce functional cytochromes. The deficiency of the respiratory chain cytochromes may not be the cause of death of the sen mutant because the cytochrome c and $aa_ 3 $ mutants of N. crassa are capable of sustained growth whereas sen is not.

One of these cell lines, LMH, produced 5 to 10 times more DNA replicative intermediates and 10 to 20 times more infectious DHBV than did {{either of the two}} human cell lines, HuH- 7 and Hep G 2. Utilization of cell lines in genetic analyses of virus replication is often dependent upon obtaining efficient complementation between cotransfected viral genomes. We assayed transcomplementation of a viral polymerase (pol) <b>gene</b> <b>mutant,</b> which is rather inefficient in transfected human cells, and found that viral DNA synthesis was at least 20 times more efficient following cotransfection of LMH cells than in similarly transfected HuH- 7 cells.

A triple csp <b>gene</b> deletion <b>mutant</b> incapable of producing any Csps, as well as double csp <b>gene</b> deletion <b>mutants</b> only producing either CspA or CspD, caused less hemolysis and produced lower LLO concentration.

Transcription analysis showed that in absence of all three csp genes or cspB alone, L. monocytogenes cells have decreased levels of hly gene transcripts, which code for the synthesis of LLO proteins. A comparative examination of mRNA stability showed that hly transcripts were more rapidly degraded in L. monocytogenes triple csp <b>gene</b> deletion <b>mutant</b> cells that are not capable of producing Csps.

We used diploid parental strains with homozygotic defects in the hexokinase PI structural gene and with only one functional hexokinase PII allele. Of 3, 000 colonies tested, 35 mutants (hex 1 r) did not repress the synthesis of invertase, maltase, malate dehydrogenase, and respiratory enzymes. These mutants had additional hexokinase PII activity. In contrast to hex 1 mutants (Entian et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 156 : 99 - 105, 1977; F. K. Zimmermann and I. Scheel, Mol. Gen. Genet. 154 : 75 - 82, 1977), which were allelic to structural <b>gene</b> <b>mutants</b> of hexokinase PII and had no catalytic activity (K. -D. Entian, Mol. Gen. Gent. 178 : 633 - 637, 1980), the hex 1 r mutants sporulated hardly at all or formed aberrant cells. Those ascospores obtained were mostly inviable. As the few viable hex 1 r segregants were sterile, triploid cells were constructed to demonstrate allelism between hex 1 r mutants and hexokinase PII structural <b>gene</b> <b>mutants.</b> Metabolite concentrations, growth rate, and ethanol production were the same in hex 1 r mutants and their corresponding wild-type strains. Recombination of hexokinase and glucokinase alleles gave strains with different specific activities. The defect in carbon catabolite repression was strongly associated with the defect in hexokinase PII and was independent of the glucose phosphorylating capacity. Hence, a secondary effect caused by reduced hexose phosphorylation was {{not responsible for the}} repression defect in hex 1 mutants. These results, and those with the hex 1 r mutants isolated, strongly supported our earlier hypothesis that hexokinase PII is a bifunctional enzyme with (i) catalytic activity and (ii) a regulatory component triggering carbon catabolite repression (Entian, Mol.
