40|$|International audienceSeveral empiric {{cumulative}} {{distributions of}} <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> and distances between seismic events {{occurred in the}} Southern Iberian Peninsula from 1985 to 2000 (data extracted from the seismic catalogue of the Andalusian Institute of Geophysics) are investigated. <b>Elapsed</b> <b>times</b> and distances between consecutive seismic events of the whole catalogue, taking into account threshold magnitudes of 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0, and of five seismic crises, without distinguishing magnitudes, are investigated. Additionally, the series of distances and <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> from the main event to every aftershock are also analysed for the five seismic crises. Even though a power law is sometimes a satisfactory model for the cumulative distribution of <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> and distances between seismic events, in some cases a fit with a Weibull distribution for <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> performs better. It is worth of mention that, {{in the case of}} the seismic crises, the fit achieved by the power law is sometimes improved when it is combined with a logarithmic law. The results derived might be a contribution to a better representation of the seismic activity by means of models that could be based on random-walk processes...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E
5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

5|$|The inaugural Giro used a points {{system to}} {{determine}} the race winner. The organizers chose to have a points system over a system based around <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after the scandal that engulfed the 1904 Tour de France. Another factor in the organizer's decision {{was that it would}} be cheaper to count the placings of the riders rather than clocking their times during each stage. The race leader was determined by adding up each rider's placing in each stage. Thus if a rider placed second in the first stage and third in the second stage he would have a total of five points, and whoever had the lowest points total was the leader. Under this system Luigi Ganna was declared the winner, but had the Giro been a time-based event he would have lost to the third-place finisher Giovanni Rossignoli by 37 minutes.|$|E
5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated <b>elapsed</b> <b>time,</b> as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E

5|$|Hill raced at open {{competitions}} and Top Fuel {{events from}} 1955 until {{he retired in}} 1966. After opening a motorcycle shop, he returned several years later to race motorcycles. He started racing drag boats after attending a drag boat event in 1974 and he won championships {{in all of the}} major boat drag racing sanctioning bodies. Hill set the lowest wet <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> (e.t.) record with a 5.16-second run, which was lower than the land drag racing record of 5.39seconds. He quit water drag racing after he suffered broken bones at a crash in Arizona and returned to land drag racing in 1985. Initially underfunded and unsuccessful, Hill set the all-time speed record at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) event in 1987, becoming the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. In 1993, Hill became the NHRA's oldest Top Fuel champion. When Hill retired in 1999, he had won 12national season point championships on land or water, and had won more than 100trophies in motorcycles and 86drag events between his land and water careers.|$|E
5|$|Hill won {{the first}} of his {{thirteen}} NHRA national events when he beat Joe Amato in final of the 1988 Mac Tools Gatornationals. Amato and Hill met in four final rounds that season, with Hill winning three. On April 9, 1988, he set the first foursecond <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> (4.990seconds) at the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) Texas Nationals. Hill made the run on only seven cylinders; the post-run computer readout showed his #7 cylinder failed at launch. Six months later, Hill recorded a 4.936-second e.t. at the NHRA SuperNationals at Houston on October 9, 1988. Hill set the record as the oldest Top Fuel champion when he won the season championship as a 57-year-old. It was his twelfth championship. Hill won a record-tying six of seven national events and 15events overall. Hill finished in the Top 10 in Top Fuel points for {{all but one of the}} years between 1987 and 1995. Between 1994 and 1999, Hill won his final two events in seven finals. When Hill won the 1996 Mile High Nationals, he set the record for the oldest Top Fuel event winner at age 60. He retired in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E

40|$|Orbit {{determination}} and ephemeris generation or prediction over relatively long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> {{can be accomplished}} with mean elements.

Previous epoch point conversion methods are restricted to shorter <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> with linear convergence. The new method presented in this paper calculates an analytic initial guess of the unknown mean elements from a first order theory of secular perturbations and computes a transition matrix with accurate numerical partials. It thereby eliminates the problem of an inaccurate initial guess and an identity transition matrix employed by previous methods. With a good initial guess of the unknown mean elements and an accurate transition matrix, converging osculating elements to mean elements can be accomplished over long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> with quadratic convergence...|$|R

As with the launch, this was the first night landing of the program. The Shuttle orbiters had no on-board lights, due to the difficulty of designing landing lights to survive re-entry, and so the runway was lit by high-intensity xenon arc lamps to guide the orbiter in. There was no pressing operational requirement for a night landing, but there was a desire to prove it was possible. Footage of the landing was shown in the 1986 film SpaceCamp.|$|E
5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E

40|$|AbstractHidden {{conditional}} random fields (HCRFs) directly {{model the}} conditional {{probability of a}} label sequence given observations. Compared to hidden Markov models (HMMs), HCRFs provide a number of benefits in modeling of speech signals. This paper presents a speaker modeling technique using a universal background model (UBM) approach with discriminative trained HCRFs. An efficient method is proposed for adapting the UBM to an HCRF-based speaker model, and it is further enhanced by discriminative training. For the identification of 300 speakers drawn from the MAT 2000 database, the experimental {{results indicate that the}} HCRF-UBM approach consistently achieved the lowest error rate among the three approaches (GMM-UBM, HMM-UBM and HCRF-UBM) regardless of the length of the enrollment speech.
