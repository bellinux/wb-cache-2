25|$|Meanwhile in the Cursed Earth, Dredd is {{assigned}} four judges, {{one for each}} township. Not only is four judges not enough, but each of them is inadequate to the task before them, due to some deficiency – Cunningham never completed his Cursed Earth survival training, Munn is insubordinate, <b>Heck</b> <b>is</b> incompetent and Ramone is addicted to medication. Dredd takes this {{as a sign of}} the low priority accorded to his mission. Dredd insists that one judge per township is not sufficient to maintain order, and urges Sinfield to send greater numbers, but Sinfield refuses. Instead, Dredd is forced to create an amateur police force by deputising some of the mutants.|$|E

It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which made it hard to control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What The <b>Heck?</b> <b>is</b> missing.|$|E
