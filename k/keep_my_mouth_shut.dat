500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{rear side}} of the left wing shows the Nativity of Jesus and the Assumption of Mary. The rear of the central panel (painted in a {{different}} style and in a lesser state of preservation {{than the rest of}} the altarpiece) shows the Last Judgment as a doom. The rear of the right panel shows the Annunciation with the Unicorn (almost a carbon copy of the same scene from the Altarpiece of the Dominicans) and the Adoration of the Magi. Remarkably, both the blessed in the depiction of Paradise and the damned in the depiction of Hell in the Last Judgement are almost all clerical people: popes, bishops, monks, nuns. A nun deep in the fire is shown pointing her finger at her tongue; a text (in German) running next to her says [...] "I didn't <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> that's why I'm deep in hell" [...] (Darum, dass ich nit han geswiegen ich tief in der Helle liegen).|$|E
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E
2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, I felt I could avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory. But I wasn't successful even at that. ...Before I walked into the courtroom my counsel told me to just enter a plea of guilty and <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> afterward. I didn't even have a trial...|$|E

6000|$|He reflected, [...] "What's {{the matter}} with me to-day? Seems like I've got an awful grouch. Only they talk so darn much. But I better steer careful and <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut." ...|$|R
60|$|To be {{suddenly}} aroused {{out of a}} sound sleep, {{and immediately}} afterwards to find yourself struggling in deep, dark water is not an experience to be desired. The first plunge made me shiver from head to foot, {{and it was only}} by instinct that I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> and struck out to keep myself afloat.|$|R

60|$|We just {{caught the}} train to Warwick, and by luck {{got back to the}} hotel ten minutes before the mother turned up. Young Milberry carried the child in his arms all the way. He said I could have the hamper for myself, and gave me half-a-sovereign extra on the {{understanding}} that I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> which I did.|$|R

2500|$|According to Baker, Hemingway was [...] "deeply {{wounded by}} the {{negative}} reviews" [...] of this novel. Furthermore, Baker explains Hemingway was unaware that {{those close to}} him agreed {{with the majority of}} critics. For example, his wife Mary, who disapproved of Across the River and into the Trees, said: [...] "I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> Nobody had appointed me my husband's editor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if I don't <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> {{somebody}} 'll have {{my teeth}} {{out of my}} head. Every one for himself and God for us all. I suppose there's a deal of money flying about. He'll {{put a lot of}} money on this 'orse of yours for the Leger if he's managed right. There's more to be got out of that than calling him Silverbridge and walking arm-in-arm. Business is business. I don't know whether I make myself understood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} soon, you dear creature! What a pretty foot!" [...] bawled Essper after her, {{as she left}} the room. [...] "Now {{confound}} this hag; if there be not meat about this house may I <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> at our next dinner. What's that in the corner? a boar's tusk! Ay, ay! a huntsman's cottage; and when lived a huntsman on black bread before! Oh! bless your bright eyes for these eggs, and this basin of new milk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{want him}} to use the snake," [...] said the sufferer, [...] "but he insisted, {{and told me to}} <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> about it." [...] After that poor Nick began to rave again and had to be given some {{medicine}} to keep him quiet. During one of his good spells he was removed to a house located about half a mile from Putnam Hall, where he could get the benefit of absolute quietness. His father went back to business, but his mother remained behind to nurse her boy.|$|E
60|$|Then he hove up {{his other}} {{suspender}} and started for'ard, and inside of three-quarters {{of an hour}} his craft was only a pale torch again in the distance. Yes, it was a mistake, Peters--that remark of mine. I don't reckon I'll ever get over being sorry about it. I'd 'a' beat the bully of the firmament if I'd kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, mother. Of {{course you}} can do as you like; but at any rate I will not <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> when I see that fellow ill-treating the slaves. Such things were never done in my father's time, and I won't see them done now. You {{said the other day}} you would get me a {{nomination}} to West Point as soon as I was sixteen. I should be glad if you would do so. By the time I have gone through the school, you will perhaps see that I have been right about Jonas." ...|$|E
6000|$|While he {{had worked}} on the {{addition}} Miles had talked frankly to Carol. He admitted now that {{so long as he}} stayed in Gopher Prairie he would remain a pariah. Bea's Lutheran friends were as much offended by his agnostic gibes as the merchants by his radicalism. [...] "And I can't seem to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> I think I'm being a baa-lamb, and not springing any theories wilder than 'c-a-t spells cat,' but when folks have gone, I re'lize I've been stepping on their pet religious corns. Oh, the mill foreman keeps dropping in, and that Danish shoemaker, and one fellow from Elder's factory, and a few Svenskas, but you know Bea: big good-hearted wench like her wants a lot of folks around--likes to fuss over 'em--never satisfied unless she tiring herself out making coffee for somebody.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{thoughts}} may get {{you into}} trouble, my girl," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Let me tell you this: However much I hate this war, I'm not fighting it publicly. To you I have spoken in private--just a private conversation. The trouble with me is, I talk too much; I don't know enough to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut.</b> I guess I'll never learn that. I ain't a hypocrite, and I ain't a pacifist. I say the United States must win this war because it has started the job, and right or wrong, must finish it. I guess we could beat the whole world, if we had to. But I ain't fool {{enough to say that}} all they do down at Washington is right, 'cause I know it ain't. But I'm standing by the flag. My boy is standing by the flag, and he'll fight as well as any in the whole army to keep the flag flying over this great republic. By and by we'll get better congressmen; the ones we got now are accidents. But in spite of all accidents--and they're mostly our own fault--I'm for America first, last and all the time. That's Jake Kasker. I don't like the Germans and I don't like the English, for Jake Kasker is a George Washington American. What are you doing, girl?" [...] he suddenly asked with a change of tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Easily enough. I kept <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut</b> {{and stayed}} away from the rascals," [...] said the goat. [...] "I knew that the {{soldiers}} would not care for a skinny old beast like me, for to the eye of a stranger I seem good for nothing.

[...] "I don't think you'd love me if I were poor" [...] she says, to which Schlemmer responds [...] "I might, but I'd <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut." [...] To prove his interest, he tells her about [...] "A Little Bungalow" [...] (reprise).|$|R
6000|$|... "Reckon I want to be, Ellen," [...] he returned, nodding his shaggy head. [...] "It ain't {{easy to be}} fond of you as I am an' <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shet....

60|$|Of course, it {{was quite}} clear to me what had {{happened}} to the boy. He had crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite windows, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had screwed the manhole stopper, and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to one against his getting back. It was fairly evident that he would gravitate with my bales to somewhere near the middle of the sphere and remain there, and so cease to be a legitimate terrestrial interest, however remarkable he might seem to the inhabitants of some remote quarter of space. I very speedily convinced myself on that point. And as for any responsibility I might have in the matter, the more I reflected upon that, the clearer it became that if only I kept quiet about things, I need not trouble myself about that. If I was faced by sorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely to demand my lost sphere--or ask them what they meant. At first I had had a vision of weeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications; but now I saw that I simply had to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>shut,</b> and nothing in that way could arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the more evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.|$|E
