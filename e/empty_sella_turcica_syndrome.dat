Methods: The obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation score, total volume of hemorrhage, shock index, level of consciousness {{at the time of}} shock occurrence and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging findings were evaluated in nine women who showed massive hemorrhage during delivery. These clinical outcomes were analyzed in all these patients who were prospectively followed-up to identify any possible occurrence of Sheehan syndrome. Results: Compared to six women with non-Sheehan syndrome, three women who were diagnosed with Sheehan syndrome showed significant elevation of the obstetrical disseminated intravascular coagulation score, decrease in the level of consciousness during shock and remarkable pituitary gland atrophic change with an <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> detected by pituitary magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|Hypopituitarism is a {{clinically}} important {{diagnosis and}} has not previously been reported in Hunter syndrome. We contrast two cases with anatomic pituitary anomalies: one with anterior panhypopituitarism {{and the other with}} intact pituitary function. Patient 1, a 10 -year-old boy with Hunter syndrome, was evaluated for poor growth and an ectopic posterior pituitary gland. Endocrine testing revealed growth hormone (GH) deficiency, secondary adrenal insufficiency, and tertiary hypothyroidism. An improvement in growth velocity with hormone replacement (GH, thyroxine, and corticosteroid) was seen; however, final adult height remained compromised. Patient 2, a 13 -year-old male with Hunter syndrome, was evaluated for growth failure. He had a large <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> with posteriorly displaced pituitary. Functional endocrine testing was normal and a trial of GH-treatment yielded no significant effect. Panhypopituitarism associated with pituitary anomalies has not been previously reported in Hunter syndrome and was an incidental finding of significant clinical importance. In the setting of documented anterior hypopituitarism, while hormone replacement improved growth velocity, final height remained impaired. In patient 2 with equivocal GH-testing results, treatment had no effect on linear growth. These cases highlight the importance of careful clinical assessment in Hunter syndrome and that judicious hormone replacement may be indicated in individual cases...|$|R

This condition typically affects obese women. The incidence of IIH is increasing with the rising prevalence of obesity. Persistent headache {{is the most common}} symptom. Visual impairment is a serious complication that may not be recognized by the patients. This paper reviews clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and current treatments of IIH in adults. Various imaging modalities have been studied on their validity for detection of IIH and papilledema. This review also includes new studies on medical, surgical, and interventional management of this condition. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials about their efficacy in treatment of IIH. In patients who have severe visual impairment or progressive visual deterioration despite medical management, surgical or interventional treatment may be considered. The efficacy and complications of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and endovascular venous stenting reported in the last 3 decades have been summarized in this review.

MATERIALS: Lateral cephalometric radiographs of 95 cleft and 190 noncleft individuals. Radiographs {{were divided into two}} groups by age: 11 to 14 years of age, 15 years and above. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The morphology of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was categorized into six shapes; whereas, the size of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was measured in terms of length, depth, and diameter in millimeters. RESULTS: The <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was abnormal in shape in the majority of cleft subjects when compared with noncleft subjects (p=. 0000), more so in subjects with unilateral cleft lip and palate and bilateral cleft lip and palate (p=. 0000, p=. 020, respectively). Depth of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was smaller in unilateral cleft lip and palate subjects (p=. 037). A smaller <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> size (length, depth, diameter) was evident in cleft subjects as compared with noncleft subjects (p=. 037, p=. 004, p=. 000, respectively).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the size of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> in cleft {{subjects}} from the age of 4 - 33 years by using standardized serial lateral radiographic cepholgrams. Forty-nine subjects with cleft of the lip and/or palate were included; 24 unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), 17 bilateral cleft of the lip and palate (BCLP), 6 cleft of the lip (CL), and 2 cleft palate only (CP). The length, depth, and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> were measured and the mean values were analyzed longitudinally. The results show that when comparing mean dimensional changes of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> between cleft groups, an increase in the diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was apparent with growth, more so than length and depth. Subjects with UCLP displayed the largest dimensional changes in depth and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> with age (+ 0. 04167, + 0. 04167), while subjects with BCLP showed a reduction in the mean length and depth (- 0. 05882 mm, - 0. 05882 mm). Significant variations were found in the length, depth and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> between cleft groups (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 001, and P < 0. 001 respectively). When the affect of age was studied, a positive tendency towards an increase in the linear dimensions of depth and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was evident as age increased (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: <b>Sella</b> <b>turcica</b> is a saddle-shaped {{concavity}} {{located in}} the middle cranial fossa of the skull. The exact dimensions of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> are an important consideration in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases related to the pituitary gland and brain. The <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> size and morphology is different from person to person. Thus, obtaining any data in this regard {{will be a great}} help in detecting abnormalities within this anatomic area. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} find out the correlation between the morphological variations of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> with age and gender. Materials and Methods: Study sample consisted of 311 cephalograms of patients with age ranging 6 – 40 years. The contour of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was traced and the linear measurements – length, depth, and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> – were measured according to Silverman. Results: Morphology of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> appeared to be normal shape in 27. 3 % of the study population followed by combination (26. 7 %), irregular (15. 8 %), pyramidal (10. 6 %), bridge (10 %), oblique anterior wall (5. 5 %), and double contour (4. 2 %). Gender-wise comparison of the linear measurement was not statistically significant. Among the linear measurement, the parameter depth and diameter were statistically significant (P < 0. 001) when correlated with age. On comparison of shape of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> with linear measurements, the parameter length was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: There is no significant relationship between the linear measurements and gender. There exists a significant relationship between the mean depth and mean diameter with age.

40|$|The <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> is a {{structure}} {{which can be}} readily seen on lateral cephalometric radiographs and sella point is routinely traced for various cephalometric analyses. The search was carried out using the following key words (<b>sella</b> <b>turcica,</b> bridging of <b>sella,</b> size, shape of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica)</b> and with the following search engine (Pubmed, Cochrane, Google scholar). The morphology {{is very important for}} the cephalometric position of the reference point sella, not only for evaluating craniofacial morphology, but also when growth changes and orthodontic treatment results are to be evaluated. This makes it a good source of additional diagnostic information related to pathology of the pituitary gland, or to various syndromes that affect the craniofacial region. Clinicians should be familiar with the normal radiographic anatomy and morphologic variability of this area, in order to recognize and investigate deviations that may reflect pathological situations, even before these become clinically apparent. During embryological development, the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> area is the key point for the migration of the neural crest cells to the frontonasal and maxillary developmental fields.

Results: A normal <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> shape was the most frequently occurring in 65 (61. 3 %) of the total sample population. Skeletal Class II was the most predominant craniofacial problem in 53 (50 %) and in 13 (46. 4 %) in CVM Stage 3, with {{a significant difference in the}} diameter, P 90 ° was highest in 50 (47. 2 %). There was a significant difference in the diameter of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> among gender with skeletal Class II. The largest diameter of 18 mm was observed in females and in CVM Stage 4. The mean area of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> is the same for both CVM Stages 1 and 5 (74. 07 mm 2). The difference in the area of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was highest in the transition between Stages 1 and 2 (8. 81 mm 2) and similar between Stages 2, 3, and 4 (2. 38 mm 2). The mean area of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> demonstrated a sequential increase from CVM Stages 2 - 6. Conclusion: The CVM stages may be utilized as a diagnostic tool in the clinic to differentiate the pubertal growth spurt and determining the best time for treating certain orthodontic problems. The linear dimensions of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> cannot be used as a diagnostic tool in determining skeletal classes...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{document}} {{the accuracy of}} CT and MR of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> for detecting adrenocor-ticotropic hormone-secreting adenomas in Cushing disease. METHODS: The radiologic findings of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> prior to transsphenoidal surgery are reviewed in 141 patients who had biochemical evidence of pituitary-dependent Cushing disease. Axial thin-collimation CT scans with sagittal and coronal reformations before and after contrast enhancement were obtained in 125 patients. Seventy-eight patients had MR examinations with a 1. 5 -T superconducting magnet. In 11 of the patients gadolinium-enhanced MR scans were also obtained. The preoperative interpre-tation of the imaging studies was correlated with the surgical findings and patient follow-up. RESOL TS: The <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> was enlarged in 43 cases (30 %). In 125 patients reformatted or direct coronal thin-collimation CT scans were available. Seventy-eight of the patients had MR. In the 12 patients with pituitary macroadenomas, the accuracy of CT (n = 1 0) and MR (n = 1 0) in respect to detection of the lesion was 100 %. Of the 98 microadenomas assessed by CT, 47 (48 %) were directly depicted as distinct hypodense lesions. In only 31 of 73 cases (42 %), however, could CT predict the precise anatomic location and extent of the lesions. Only patients in whom the hypercortisolism was corrected by later surgery were considered for the correlation analysis. Of the 52 microadenomas assessed by MR, 28 (53 %) were directly depicted as distinct lesions of reduced signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images, and in only 21 of 41 cases (52 %) did MR show good correlation to the surgical findings. Some degree of partially <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> was found in 22 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although both the sensitivity and the diagnostic accuracy of imaging methods of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> have been considerably improved in comparison with previous reports, they still provide only a minor contribution to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Cushing syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{orthodontic}} science, {{diagnosis of}} facial skeletal type (class I, II, and III) {{is essential to}} make the correct treatment plan that is usually expensive and complicated. Sometimes results from analysis of lateral cephalometry radiographies are not enough to discriminate facial skeletal types. In this situation, knowledge {{about the relationship between}} the shape and size of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> and the type of facial skeletal class can help to make a more definitive decision for treatment plan. Objectives The present study was designed to investigate this relationship in patients referred to a dental school in Iran. Patients and Methods In this descriptive-analytical study, cephalometric radiographies of 90 candidates for orthodontic treatment (44 females and 46 males) with an age range of 14 - 26 years and equal distribution in terms of class I, class II, and class III facial skeletal classification were selected. The shape, length, diameter, and depth of the <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> were determined on the radiographs. Linear dimensions were assessed by one-way analysis of variance while the correlation between the dimensions and age was investigated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results <b>Sella</b> <b>turcica</b> had normal morphology in 24. 4 % of the patients while irregularity (notching) in the posterior part of the dorsum sella was observed in 15. 6 %, double contour of sellar floor in 5. 6 %, <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> bridge in 23. 3 %, oblique anterior wall in 20 % and pyramidal shape of the dorsum sella in 11. 1 % of the subjects. In total, 46. 7 % of class I patients had a normal shape of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica,</b> 23. 3 % of class II patients had an oblique anterior wall and a pyramidal shape of the dorsum sella, and 43. 3 % of class III individuals had <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> bridge (the greatest values). <b>Sella</b> <b>turcica</b> length was significantly greater in class III patients compared to class II and class I (P < 0. 0001). However, depth and diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> were similar in class I, class II, and class III patients. Furthermore, age was significantly correlated to the diameter of <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> as greater diameters were observed in older ages (P < 0. 04). Conclusion A significant relationship exists between the type of facial skeletal classification and the shape of the sella turcica; as in class III patients, <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> bridge was reported with a higher frequency. Also, <b>sella</b> <b>turcica</b> had a significantly higher length in these patients than in those with class I and class II facial skeletal types...|$|R
