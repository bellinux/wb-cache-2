60|$|Domestic {{varieties}} as {{a general}} rule certainly differ from one another in less important parts than do species; and when important differences occur, they are seldom firmly fixed; but this fact is intelligible, if we consider man's method of selection. In the living animal or plant he cannot observe internal modifications in the more important organs; nor does he regard them {{as long as they are}} compatible with health and life. What does the breeder care about any slight change in the molar teeth of his pigs, or for an additional molar tooth in the dog; or for any change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ? The breeder cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat, and for an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep, and this he has effected. What would the <b>floriculturist</b> care for any change in the structure of the ovarium or of the ovules? As important internal organs are certainly liable to numerous slight variations, and as these would probably be transmitted, for many strange monstrosities are inherited, man could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in these organs. When he has produced any modification in an important part, he has generally done so unintentionally, in correlation with some other conspicuous part. For instance, he has given ridges and protuberances to the skulls of fowls, by attending to the form of the comb, or to the plume of feathers on the head. By attending to the external form of the pouter-pigeon, he has enormously increased the size of the oesophagus, and has added to the number of the ribs, and given them greater breadth. With the carrier-pigeon, by increasing through steady selection the wattles on the upper mandible, he has greatly modified the form of the lower mandible; and so in many other cases. Natural species, on the other hand, have been modified exclusively for their own good, to fit them for infinitely diversified conditions of life, to avoid enemies of all kinds, and to struggle against a host of competitors. Hence, under such complex conditions, it would often happen that modifications of the most varied kinds, in important as well as in unimportant parts, would be advantageous or even necessary; and they would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of the fittest. Still more important is the fact that various indirect modifications would likewise arise through the law of correlated variation.|$|E

The development plant breeding of new varieties is a major occupation of <b>floriculturists.</b> Floriculture crops include bedding plants, flowering plants, foliage plants or houseplants, cut cultivated greens, and cut flowers. As distinguished from nursery crops, floriculture crops are generally herbaceous. Bedding and garden plants consist of young flowering plants (annuals and perennials) and vegetable plants. Flowers are mainly for export and this business is growing {{in the world at}} around 6-10 per cent per annum. India’s share in the international market for these flowers is still negligible. However, Karnataka is in the limelight for floriculture right from the 18th century and is now the leader in floriculture, accounting for 75% of India's total flower production. The state has the highest area under modern cut flowers, and 40 flower growing and exporting units. The country's first and only flower auction centre is located in Karnataka. As per statistics for the year 2003-04, out of a total area of 18182 ha under commercial flower crops, jasmine (the three varieties) accounts for 3,451 ha (about 19%) and the average yield of flowers is reported to be 6 tons/ha with a total production of 20,244 tons.|$|R

40|$|Pesticides {{constitute}} a heterogeneous category of chemicals {{specifically designed for}} the control of pests, weeds or plant diseases. Pesticides have been considered potential chemical mutagens: experimental data revealed that various agrochemical ingredients possess mutagenic properties inducing mutations, chromosomal alterations or DNA damage. Biological monitor-ing provides a useful tool to estimate the genetic risk deriving from an integrated exposure to a complex mixture of chemicals. Studies available in scientific literature have essentially focused on cytogenetic end-points to evaluate the potential genotox-icity of pesticides in occupationally exposed populations, including pesticide manufacturing workers, pesticide applicators, <b>floriculturists</b> and farm workers. A positive association between occupational exposure to complex pesticide mixtures {{and the presence of}} chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) has been detected in the majority of the studies, although a number of these failed to detect cytogenetic damage. Conflicting results from cytogenetic studies reflect the heterogeneity of the groups studied with regard to chemicals used and exposure conditions. Genetic damage associated with pesticides occurs in human populations subject to high exposure levels due to intensive use, misuse or failure of control measures. The majority of studies on cytogenetic biomarkers in pesticide-exposed workers have indicated some dose-dependent effects, with increasing duration or intensity of exposure. Chromosomal damage induced by pesticides appears to have been transient in acute or discontinuous exposure, but cumu-lative in continuous exposure to complex agrochemical mixtures. Data available at present on the effect of genetic polymorphism on susceptibility to pesticides does not allow any conclusion...|$|R

However, moving a field-grown summer crop into a greenhouse as a winter crop was not the same as moving a winter greenhouse-grown crop outside for the summer. Not only were the plants typically grown in lush field soil, but also the fertilizer recommendations were not directly translatable (i. e., parts per million nitrogen). The pesticides used were not licensed for greenhouses and of course, there were no clues as to schedules of what to do when. Finally, there were the mystery problems that occurred. With high gas prices and the interest in local food production, it seems probable that over the next 5 to 10 years, more and more fruit, vegetables and even nut plants will be moved into greenhouse and high tunnel production.

40|$|O mercado brasileiro {{de flores}} e plantas ornamentais apresenta-se com perspectivas de crescimento e conseqüente incremento para os principais segmentos da cadeia produtiva: produção, distribuição e comercialização. Esta previsão, bastante otimista, vem atraindo para o setor novos empreendedores, com conseqüente aumento da concorrência e a constante necessidade da busca por novos produtos e serviços. Com o objetivo de compreender a nova tendência da cadeia de flores e plantas ornamentais e de avaliar a estrutura do segmento varejista no município de Lavras (MG), realizou-se um levantamento de informações junto aos estabelecimentos que comercializam flores e plantas ornamentais, no primeiro semestre de 2003. Para tanto, utilizou-se de uma pesquisa de caráter exploratório, com perguntas voltadas à estrutura operacional da empresa, além de questões sociais sobre o florista, podendo-se citar o nível de conhecimento na área e preocupação com atualização. No município não há estabelecimentos com auto-serviço de flores e plantas ornamentais, apenas floriculturas comerciais, que totalizam 11 estabelecimentos, dentre os quais, 64 % realizam projetos paisagísticos, 73 % oferecem trabalhos de jardinagem, e 45 % possuem produção própria, sendo que esta se caracteriza, de modo geral, por plantios protegidos em pequenas áreas, voltados para o próprio abastecimento, apenas com cultivos orgânicos, simplificados, de mudas para jardim. Assim, todos dependem do fornecimento regular de plantas, em sua maioria realizado diretamente por grandes atacadistas, ponto a ponto. De maneira geral, observou-se que os varejistas limitam-se à participação na disputa de preços, mostrando-se preocupados com os altos níveis de competitividade em que o mercado encontra-se e menos interessados na diversificação dos produtos e serviços e estratégias de marketing. Por outro lado, há poucos comerciantes voltados para a oferta de produtos com valores agregados e inovadores, buscando maiores margens. Pode-se inferir que isto se deve ao tempo de atuação no mercado, uma vez que 64 % das empresas possuem mais de 6 anos, enquanto as outras 36 % atuam há menos de 3 anos. Um dos principais problemas informados pelos comerciantes locais é a concorrência com vendedores ambulantes de plantas. Devido, em parte, à competitividade no segmento, não se observa interação entre os floristas, excluindo-se assim, a possibilidade de uma integração produtiva, a qual, entre outras vantagens, poderia proporcionar melhor estruturação do setor.

For this porpose, was made an exploratory research with questions about the enterprise operational structure and social questions about the florists, like knowledge level in the area and their concern about to be up to date. In the county there aren't cash and carrier flower's shops, only commercial <b>floriculturist,</b> among them 64 % work with landscape design projects, 73 % offer gardening works, and 45 % have self-production, being characterized generally by protected planting in small areas and only organic and simplified cultivation of garden's seedlings for self-provisions. Therefore, at the majority all florists depend on regular plants supply accomplished directly by large wholesaler, store to store. In general, it was observed that the retailers are limited in the price dispute showing their concern with the market competition high levels, and fewer interested in the productions and services diversification. Moreover, there are few sellers that offer innovation of products and services with aggregated value, searching for highest margins. This can be the result {{from the time of the}} floricultures at the market, once that 64 % of the enterprises have more than 6 years, while the others 36 % have fewer than 3 years. One of the main problems informed by the local florists is the competition of the door-to-door plant's salesmen. Due to the competitiveness of the segment, there isn't florist interaction excluding a productive integration possibility that can afford a better sector organization among others advantages...|$|E
