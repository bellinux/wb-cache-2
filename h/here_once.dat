From there, he {{went directly}} to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri, where he supported himself by selling Oliver typewriters. <b>Here,</b> <b>once</b> again, it was the Hebrew language and Old Testament studies that engrossed Maier. And once again, his love for the subject caused him to excel in it. Upon graduation in 1916, and in recognition of his proficiency in the field, young Maier was awarded a graduate fellowship in Old Testament studies at Harvard Divinity School.|$|E

500|$|According to Leslie C. Orr, the Saptamatrika, {{who first}} {{appeared}} in South India in the eighth century, had once temples dedicated exclusively to them, but the ninth century onwards, they were demoted to status of [...] "deities of the entourage" [...] (parivara devata) of Shiva. Their images moved from the sanctums to corners of temple complexes {{and now they are}} as guardian deities in small village shrines. The Saptamatrikas are worshipped as Saptakanyakas (the celestial nymphs) in most South Indian Shiva temples. But the Selliyamman temple at Alambakkam in Tiruchirapalli district (In 1909 called Trichonopoly district) is important in worship of the Matrikas. <b>Here</b> <b>once</b> stood a temple dedicated to the Saptamatrika, which was replaced by the present temple.|$|E

[...] And I went to President Clinton myself and then Attorney General Janet Reno, and I said we need one thing. If we are going to bail Mexico out, let us make them sign an {{extradition}} treaty of fugitives, murders, criminals and get our kids back from Mexico. Right? Did not happen. What a perfect time for us to say we are going to save your entire country, we are going to lend you billions of dollars and shore up your economy, but you know what, since that meeting with President Clinton we now have on record over 3,000 murders and fugitives down there and we do not know how many kids".|$|E

2500|$|<b>Here,</b> <b>once</b> again, the cité neufve was {{claimed to}} be New York; au tour de had {{to refer to the}} Twin Towers (even though, in French, the word tour in the {{masculine}} – as it is here – has {{absolutely nothing to do with}} towers, but is part of a phrase meaning [...] "around"); the Deux grands rochiers had to be the Twin Towers themselves; and Arethusa was said to be an anagram of 'the USA'. Once again, however, a rather more sober investigation by Brind'Amour had already revealed (bearing in mind that, in French, faire la guerre aux rochers, or 'to make war on the rocks', simply means 'to struggle fruitlessly') that the reference was probably to Naples and its nearby volcano. Subsequent investigation by Lemesurier and his colleague Gary Somai suggested that it applied particularly to the Annales Cassinis report of its lava eruption of 1036, at a time when the Lombards of Capua and the Byzantine dukes of Naples were constantly at war over the city prior to the decisive intervention of the Normans. For 968, similarly, Leo Marsicanus had reported in the same annals that ‘Mount Vesuvius exploded into flames and sent out huge quantities of sticky, sulfurous matter that formed a river rushing down to the sea’. Thus, given that Arethusa was the classical nymph of springs and rivers, with a well-known 'spring of Arethusa' still visible today in the Sicilian port of Syracuse, the case for a '9/11' interpretation was evidently unfounded.|$|E
