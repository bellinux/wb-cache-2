5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} <b>doctrine</b> of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the <b>doctrine</b> was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original <b>doctrine</b> should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the <b>doctrine</b> came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe <b>Doctrine,</b> a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region.

The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the <b>doctrine</b> also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the <b>doctrine</b> was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>doctrine</b> of karma {{is central}} to all Indian religions, it is {{difficult}} to say when and where in India the concept of karma originated.

The roots of this <b>doctrine</b> in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira.

5|$|Calvin's {{theology}} caused controversy. Pierre Caroli, a Protestant {{minister in}} Lausanne accused Calvin {{as well as}} Viret and Farel of Arianism in 1536. Calvin defended his beliefs on the Trinity in Confessio de Trinitate propter calumnias P. Caroli. In 1551 Jérôme-Hermès Bolsec, a physician in Geneva, attacked Calvin's <b>doctrine</b> of predestination and accused him of making God the author of sin. Bolsec was banished from the city, and after Calvin's death, he wrote a biography which severely maligned Calvin's character. In the following year, Joachim Westphal, a Gnesio-Lutheran pastor in Hamburg, condemned Calvin and Zwingli as heretics in denying the eucharistic <b>doctrine</b> of the union of Christ's body with the elements. Calvin's Defensio sanae et orthodoxae doctrinae de sacramentis (A Defence of the Sober and Orthodox <b>Doctrine</b> of the Sacrament) was his response in 1555. In 1556 , a Dutch dissident, held a public disputation with Calvin {{during his visit to}} Frankfurt, in which Velsius defended free will against Calvin's <b>doctrine</b> of predestination. Following the execution of Servetus, a close associate of Calvin, Sebastian Castellio, broke with him {{on the issue of the}} treatment of heretics. In Castellio's Treatise on Heretics (1554), he argued for a focus on Christ's moral teachings in place of the vanity of theology, and he afterward developed a theory of tolerance based on biblical principles.|$|E

40|$|To {{a certain}} extent the {{organization}} chart of public administration is inspired by the <b>doctrines</b> which are offered by public administration science.

These main <b>doctrines</b> have led to specific structures within public administration. When implementation is automated by means of information technology, these structures may change considerably. Some of the organizational transformations are illustrated in this chapter. It is argued that the structural transformation of public administration raises new questions with regard to some of the traditional <b>doctrines.</b> These <b>doctrines</b> have to be reinvestigated, reassessed, and maybe even restated in view of the automated implementation of public policy. ...|$|R
40|$|Article III’s {{diversity}} jurisdiction provisions {{extend the}} federal judicial power to state law controversies between different states or nations {{and their respective}} citizens. When exercising diversity jurisdiction, the federal judiciary does not function in its usual role of protecting federal interests or ensuring the uniformity of federal law. Instead, federal courts operate as alternative state courts for resolving disputes between diverse parties. But federal courts often cannot act as alternative state courts because of Article III justiciability <b>doctrines</b> such as standing, ripeness, and mootness. These <b>doctrines</b> define when a federal court may act. But they {{do not apply to}} state courts. Rather, states have developed their own justiciability <b>doctrines</b> that substantially diverge from the federal ones. The consequence is that federal courts sitting in diversity cannot hear many claims that can be brought in state court and can hear other claims that state courts lack the power to decide. This Article argues that, instead of applying federal justiciability <b>doctrines,</b> federal courts should apply state justiciability <b>doctrines</b> to state law cases brought under diversity jurisdiction. Following state justiciability <b>doctrines</b> would better achieve the goals of allowing federal courts to function as alternative state courts. Moreover, following state justiciability <b>doctrines</b> in state law cases would not undermine the rationales underlying federal justiciability <b>doctrines</b> because those <b>doctrines</b> were developed to limit the federal judiciary’s ability to interfere with the other branches of the federal government— concerns that are inapplicable in state law disputes...|$|R
25|$|The {{case for}} the unwritten <b>doctrines</b> {{involves}} two steps.
