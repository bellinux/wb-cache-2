5|$|In {{molecular}} biology, cadmium is used {{to block}} voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, {{as well as in}} <b>hypoxia</b> research to stimulate proteasome-dependent degradation of Hif-1α.|$|E
5|$|Ascent-induced <b>hypoxia</b> {{is caused}} by a drop in oxygen partial {{pressure}} as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue <b>hypoxia</b> by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue <b>hypoxia.</b> Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|The powerfully {{rising and}} sinking air in {{mountain}} waves {{was discovered by}} glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (<b>hypoxia)</b> sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the right-hand seat was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial <b>hypoxia,</b> which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral <b>hypoxia.</b> He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system <b>hypoxia.</b> If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{sometimes}} used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, {{in areas such}} as hypertension and heart failure. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and <b>hypoxia.</b> In behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, <b>hypoxia</b> caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (<b>hypoxia),</b> allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme <b>hypoxia</b> by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, <b>hypoxia</b> (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|The Euthanasia Coaster {{would kill}} its {{passengers}} through prolonged cerebral <b>hypoxia,</b> or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with gray out through tunnel vision {{to black out}} and eventually g-LOC (g-force induced loss of consciousness). Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.|$|E
5|$|The colour of C.maenas varies greatly, {{from green}} to brown, grey or red. This {{variation}} has a genetic component, but is {{largely due to}} local environmental factors. In particular, individuals which delay moulting become red–coloured rather than green. Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive, but are less tolerant of environmental stresses, such as low salinity or <b>hypoxia.</b> Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe <b>hypoxia,</b> very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of <b>hypoxia.</b> Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as environmentally friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
25|$|Intermittent <b>hypoxia</b> (also {{known as}} episodic <b>hypoxia)</b> is an {{intervention}} {{in which a}} person or animal undergoes alternating periods of normoxia and <b>hypoxia.</b> Normoxia is defined as exposure to oxygen levels normally found in earth's atmosphere (~21% O2) and <b>hypoxia</b> as any oxygen levels lower than those of normoxia. Normally, exposure to <b>hypoxia</b> is negatively associated to physiological changes to the body, such as altitude sickness. However, when used in moderation, intermittent <b>hypoxia</b> may be used clinically as a means to alleviate various pathological conditions.|$|E
25|$|A fish’s <b>hypoxia</b> {{tolerance}} {{can also}} be represented {{as the amount of}} time it can spend at a particular hypoxic PO2 before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the PO2 at which it loses equilibrium when PO2 is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called PO2-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower PO2-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced <b>hypoxia</b> tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall <b>hypoxia</b> tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to <b>hypoxia</b> tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.|$|E
25|$|On June 27, 2013, Nelson co-sponsored the Harmful Algal Bloom and <b>Hypoxia</b> Research and Control Amendments Act of 2013 (S. 1254; 113th Congress), a {{bill that}} would reauthorize and modify the Harmful Algal Bloom and <b>Hypoxia</b> Research and Control Act of 1998 and would authorize the {{appropriation}} of $20.5 million annually through 2018 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to mitigate the harmful effects of algal blooms and <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{studies done}} on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions {{have shown that}} at the genetic level fish respond to <b>hypoxia</b> by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to <b>hypoxia</b> there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, heme oxygenase 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest <b>hypoxia</b> induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after <b>hypoxia</b> exposure in the gills of zebrafish and in non-muscle tissue of the common carp suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues.|$|E
25|$|Aerial {{respiration}} is the ‘gulping’ of air at {{the surface}} of water to directly extract oxygen from the atmosphere. Aerial respiration evolved in fish that were exposed to more frequent hypoxia; also, species that engage in aerial respiration {{tend to be more}} <b>hypoxia</b> tolerant than those which do not air-breath during the <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{used as a}} rehabilitative intervention, {{particularly}} for respiration and walking, intermittent <b>hypoxia</b> typically works by using long-term facilitation (LTF). LTF, which is synonymous to long-term potentiation, occurs when there are long-term increases in synaptic strength due to synaptic plasticity. In the case of intermittent <b>hypoxia,</b> these increases in synaptic strength result in increased motor output.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) <b>hypoxia</b> exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic <b>hypoxia</b> exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of <b>hypoxia</b> inducible factor <b>hypoxia</b> inducible factor (HIF).|$|E
25|$|GHB has neuroprotective {{properties}} {{and has been}} found to protect cells from <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} may {{be required}} if the airway is unstable or <b>hypoxia</b> persists when breathing 100% oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The {{report found}} all those aboard the aircraft, {{including}} the pilot, had likely become incapacitated and begun suffering from <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that {{endogenous}} methane is produced {{not only by the}} intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial <b>hypoxia,</b> for example, sodium azide intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of intercellular signals of <b>hypoxia</b> and stress.|$|E
25|$|Its {{pathophysiology}} includes hyperactivation of {{the sympathetic}} nervous system causing extreme vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue <b>hypoxia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Relative exercise-induced <b>hypoxia</b> and {{acceleration}} of the excitoconductive system of the heart make it more susceptible to stretch-induced ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The odor {{associated}} with bogs, swamps, indeed any stagnant waters, can {{be due to}} oxygen depletion caused by the decay of deceased algal blooms. Under anoxic conditions, the bacteria inhabiting algae cultures break down the organic material and produce hydrogen sulfide and ammonia which causes the odor. This <b>hypoxia</b> often results {{in the death of}} aquatic animals. In a system where algae is intentionally cultivated, maintained, and harvested, neither eutrophication nor <b>hypoxia</b> are likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Gardner was {{examined}} by four forensic pathologists who {{concluded that the}} cause of death was cerebral <b>hypoxia.</b> As she had suffered a minor head injury during the struggle samples of brain tissue were subsequently examined by an independent neuropathologist to establish whether brain injury may have caused the <b>hypoxia</b> rather than asphyxiation as a direct result of the gag and tape. Two further tests were then conducted by independent neuropathologists who both dismissed the head injury as a factor.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that these {{conformational}} changes may have a very important physiological significance. The deactive, but not the active form of complex I was susceptible to inhibition by nitrosothiols and peroxynitrite. It is likely that transition from the active to the inactive form of complex I takes place during pathological conditions when the turnover of the enzyme is limited at physiological temperatures, such as during <b>hypoxia,</b> or when the tissue nitric oxide:oxygen ratio increases (i.e. metabolic <b>hypoxia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Fish {{are exposed}} to large oxygen {{fluctuations}} in their aquatic environment since the inherent properties of water can result in marked spatial and temporal differences in the concentration of oxygen (see oxygenation and underwater). Fish respond to <b>hypoxia</b> with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses {{in order to maintain}} homeostasis and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for ATP production through the electron transport chain. Therefore, <b>hypoxia</b> survival requires a coordinated response to secure more oxygen from the depleted environment and counteract the metabolic consequences of decreased ATP production at the mitochondria. This article is a review of the effects of <b>hypoxia</b> on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral edema is the {{accumulation}} of excess water in the extracellular space of the brain, which can result when <b>hypoxia</b> causes the blood–brain barrier to open.|$|E
25|$|Heart muscle relies {{exclusively}} on aerobic metabolism for energy. <b>Hypoxia</b> (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.|$|E
