5|$|Ryder {{could see}} no ships other than seven or eight burning MLs. He then {{realised}} that the landing places at the Old Mole and {{the entrance to the}} basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There was nothing more they could do for the Commandos, so they <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing ML 270, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} storm was observed offshore of Mexico, on September17. Tropical Storm Five had {{no change in}} intensity past a 50mph (85km/h) {{tropical storm}}, similar to Tropical Storms One, Two, and Three. While paralleling the coast of Mexico, Tropical Storm Five passed only 75mi (120km) southwest of Manzanillo. The tropical storm curved northwestward on September18, and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to sea. The system dissipated 135mi (215km) west-southwest of Islas Marías on September19.|$|E

5|$|The {{whaleboat}} {{managed to}} rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, {{which had been}} commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|Air America {{helicopters}} {{continued to}} make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult.

All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a lavish}} celebration in Berlin for {{the sinking of}} HMS Royal Oak in which the crew members of U-47 were {{received}} by Adolf Hitler and decorated, the boat returned to sea on 16 November 1939. Once the U-boat had left Kiel on 16 November, she <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> into the North Sea. After traveling around the British Isles into the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, U-47 sank a further three vessels, Navasota on 5 December, the Norwegian steamer MV Britta on 6 December and Tajandoen on 7 December. Following the sinking of Navasota, British destroyers briefly fired depth charges at the U-boat but she managed to safely evade the attack without any damage.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, {{the brigade}} formed {{part of the}} second day's {{parachute}} landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a short delay the brigade <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> for its objective. When only halfway there, however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. The brigade, having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened by fighting at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, the brigade eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|In the 33rd minute, a Chelsea free-kick, awarded after Ramires {{was brought}} down by Enrique, but it was cleared by the Liverpool defence. Enrique {{had the chance to}} counter Chelsea's attack, but he delayed his run and was dispossessed. The first yellow card of the match was shown to Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel in the 36th minute, after a mistimed tackle on Gerrard. A cross from midfielder Stewart Downing was <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> for a Liverpool corner in the 40th minute, but the {{subsequent}} corner is cleared by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech. Liverpool had another chance straight afterwards, but Suárez was unable to direct his header at goal after receiving the ball from Henderson. Towards the end of the half, Liverpool was shown a yellow card for his challenge on Mikel.|$|E

5|$|Saratoga was {{surplus to}} postwar {{requirements}} {{with the large}} numbers of Essex-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946. This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect of the atomic bomb on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny's radio show on 21 April, while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses which left gaping {{holes in the}} Allied line, {{it was decided that}} the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> along the {{south-eastern}} edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they came under heavy fire from a pillbox close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing the machine gun position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground. When its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May 1945, U-2336 left Larvik and <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} North Sea. On 7 May 1945, U-2336 sank the last Allied {{merchant}} ships {{to be lost}} to a German submarine in the war, when she torpedoed and sank the freighters Avondale Park and Sneland I (in order) off the Isle of May inside the Firth of Forth. The first of the two ships to be sunk was the Sneland I, which exploded {{as soon as it}} was hit killing seven of her crew members, including the captain. Avondale Park was hit next, alarming the 28 man crew who believed that they had struck a mine. Avondale Park sank two minutes after being hit. Two crew members had been killed while the rest managed to enter a lifeboat or jump into the sea. U-2336 later returned to Kiel on 14 May 1945 and then transferred to Wilhelmshaven, Germany, where she was surrendered to the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to Sulfur Springs {{to deny that}} source of water to the Apaches. In the early light of day, Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Decatur assumed {{command of}} President in December 1814, {{planning}} a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur {{the opportunity to}} put to sea. On the evening of 14January, President <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, President lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur {{was finally able to}} float President off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and President was forced to head out to sea.|$|E
5|$|With massive {{radio and}} video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds {{when they began}} touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour {{commenced}} {{in the autumn of}} 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat. The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band– including vintage gay porn as a joke. The tour {{was one of the most}} anticipated rock tours of the season and the band <b>headed</b> <b>out</b> on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker. Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.|$|E
