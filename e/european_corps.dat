Based in the French city of Strasbourg, the corps had its headquarters established in May 1992, activated in October 1993 and declared operational in 1995. The nucleus of the force is the Franco-German Brigade, established in 1987.|$|E

50|$|Originally, LANDCENT command was to {{be rotated}} between German and Dutch generals. In 1996, The {{commander}} of US Army Europe (USAREUR) assumed an additional role as commander of LANDCENT with General William W. Crouch assuming command. The dual command of USAREUR and LANDCENT allowed the continued integration of American forces into NATO's post-Cold War structure. In addition, an agreement was made which set out the arrangements under which the <b>European</b> <b>Corps</b> (Eurocorps), consisting of units from Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and Spain, would {{be made available to}} NATO in times of crisis.|$|E
50|$|The drum corps {{activity}} in Europe {{does not have}} as large a following or as many competing corps as that in North America, but {{for the job of}} organizing competitions across multiple nations, Drum Corps Europe performs its duties effectively. In 2006, they announced that they would closely cooperate with other drum corps organisations in Europe, from the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United kingdom. One of the organization's primary aims was to develop one European judging manual and a unified judges training system. In addition to hosting competitions with <b>European</b> <b>corps,</b> DCE has welcomed the occasional American corps to perform at European competitions, most recently the Blue Devils International Corps in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|The {{policy area}} of defence is {{traditionally}} {{the domain of}} nation states. The main military alliance in Europe remains the intergovernmental North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which presently includes 22 EU member states together with five non-EU European countries; Iceland, Norway, Albania, Montenegro and [...] Turkey {{as well as the}} United States and Canada. Although long impeded by concerns relating to national sovereignty and potential duplication of existing NATO structures, European defence integration has intensified {{in the beginning of the}} 21st century, bringing about the deployment of numerous CSDP operations and the establishment of a European Defence Agency (headed by the High Representative) as well as EU battlegroups. The latter have however never been engaged in operations, and other, recent initiatives of military integration, such as the <b>European</b> <b>corps,</b> gendarmerie force and air transport command are at present intergovernmental and outside the CFSP framework of the union.|$|E
40|$|The wide {{economic}} support and {{an attempt to}} guarantee safety, which the European governments are trying {{to provide for their}} citizens, are reasons why the European Union explores new directions of conducting common policies for which the most important is the human being and his needs. The European security policy – and the new concept of human security – could be one example of the EU`s new behavior. Taking into consideration the previous attempts at developing security theories in Europe and other countries, it is possible to state that the modern human security doctrine in the EU could be followed by creating a special kind of <b>European</b> <b>corps</b> which would be a new tool for ensuring security where it would be necessary to provide it – European Gendarmerie Forces (known as EGF or EUROGENDFOR). The aim {{of this article is to}} show the impact of the evolution of the modern security theories for creating a human security doctrine in the framework of the European Union. Moreover, genesis and activity of the EGF are presented and the author is trying to answer the question: could the EGF be a tool of human security in the EU?. Finally, a couple of proposals for the future development of the European security policy are mentioned...|$|E
