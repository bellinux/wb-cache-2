Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month <b>even</b> <b>if</b> treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week <b>even</b> <b>if</b> treated.|$|E

5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> that hurts the defense's case. Taylor was the first case to hold {{that there is no}} absolute bar to blocking the testimony of a surprise witness, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas.|$|E

5|$|A batsman can be out lbw <b>even</b> <b>if</b> {{the ball}} did not hit his leg: for example, a batsman struck {{on the head}} could be lbw. However, he cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps ("outside leg stump"), <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the ball would have {{otherwise}} hit the wickets. Similarly, a batsman who has attempted {{to hit the ball}} with his bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes him outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batsman switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batsman's position when the bowler commences his run-up.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures.

5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not.

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> this occurs on the day of birth and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
