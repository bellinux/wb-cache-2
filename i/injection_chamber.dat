40|$|The {{transient}} behaviour {{of the fuel}} spray from an air-assisted direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) fuel injector has been investigated experimentally in a constant-volume chamber. As the <b>chamber</b> and <b>injection</b> pressures were varied, ensemble-averaged planar images of the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and Mie scattering from the spray were obtained to measure the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) using the laser sheet drop-sizing (LSD) technique. The root mean square (r. m. s.) SMD was also calculated by combination of the r. m. s. LIF and r. m. s. Mie scattering signals. The effect of the <b>injection</b> and <b>chamber</b> pressures and the ambient air density on the SMD, spray tip penetration, and dispersion of the air-assisted fuel injector are determined. In keeping with recent numerical studies by the group, vortex structures appear to be shed from the injector tip in back-illuminated images, indicating that the air and liquid motion are strongly coupled. These results also show that the spray penetration and SMD vary significantly with <b>injection</b> and <b>chamber</b> density, and scalings of the spray’s overall SMD and penetration are proposed that achieve reasonable clustering in the experimental results...|$|R

50|$|In the {{standard}} pultrusion process the reinforcement materials like fibers or woven or braided strands are impregnated with resin, possibly {{followed by a}} separate preforming system, and pulled through a heated stationary die where the resin undergoes polymerization. The impregnation is either done by pulling the reinforcement through a bath or by injecting the resin into an <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> which typically {{is connected to the}} die. Many resin types may be used in pultrusion including polyester, polyurethane, vinylester and epoxy. Resin provides the resistance to the environment, (i.e., the corrosion resistance, the UV resistance, the impact resistance, etc.) and the glass provides strength, in addition to safety from fire.|$|E

50|$|The {{combustion}} may display undesired instabilities, {{of sudden}} or periodic nature. The {{pressure in the}} <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; {{a moment later the}} pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of ±200 psi at 25 kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the Titan II missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a deflagration to detonation transition; the supersonic pressure wave formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to study the efficacy and safety of Microplasmin as an anti-scarring agent after trabeculectomy in a rabbit model. Methodes The effect of Microplasmin was investigated in vivo in a rabbit model for glaucoma surgery. Clinical outcome measures were intra-ocular pressure, bleb area and survival, side effects on slit lamp examination. Moreover, (immuno-) histochemical analysis of the eyes was performed, with quantification of inflammation (CD 45) and collagen deposition (Trichrome and Sirius Red). In the first experiment (n= 10), Microplasmin anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>injection</b> was compared to placebo injection. In the second experiment (n= 3), topical Microplasmin drops were compared to placebo drops. In the third experiment (n= 5) the combination of Microplasmin anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>injection</b> and topical drops was compared to placebo injection and drops. All experiments were conducted in a masked observator way.

5000|$|S/SL (split/splitless) injector; {{a sample}} is {{introduced}} into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum - the heat facilitates volatilization {{of the sample}} and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, {{a part of the}} sample/carrier gas mixture in the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> is exhausted through the split vent. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (>0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes (<0.01%). In splitless mode the split valve opens after a pre-set amount of time to purge heavier elements that would otherwise contaminate the system. This pre-set (splitless) time should be optimized, the shorter time (e.g., 0.2 min) ensures less tailing but loss in response, the longer time (2 min) increases tailing but also signal.|$|E
50|$|CD {{moulding}} {{machines are}} specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per moulding line. Clear polycarbonate pellets are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into {{one end of the}} injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with heater bands ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is closed the screw moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|On October 31, 2016, Dozier voluntarily waived his {{appeals and}} {{wrote a letter to}} District Judge Jennifer Togliatti asking her to {{expedite}} his execution. Ten days later, on November 10, the Nevada Department of Corrections publicly announced the completion of the new lethal <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> at Ely State Prison, following the 2012 closure of the Nevada State Prison in Carson City, which previously housed the former gas chamber which had been converted to be compatible with lethal injections. The male death row was transferred from Carson City to Ely in September 2011. In a hearing on July 27, 2017, Judge Togliatti signed Dozier's death warrant, permitting his execution to take place [...] "in the week of October 16, 2017". Following a hearing on August 17, 2017, Dozier's execution was pushed back to the week of November 13, 2017. Should Dozier's execution go ahead, {{it will be the first}} execution in Nevada since the April 26, 2006 execution of Daryl Mack.

40|$|Basing on {{many years}} of {{experience}} a new extensive high quality database was obtained for stationary upward air-water flows in a vertical pipe with an inner diameter of 195. 3 mm using the wire-mesh sensor technology. During the experiments the sensor was always mounted {{on the top of}} the test section while the distance between gas injection and measuring plane was varied to up to 18 different L/D by using gas <b>injection</b> <b>chambers</b> at different vertical positions. The gas was injected via holes in the pipe wall. In this new test series the pressure was kept at 0. 25 MPa (absolute) at the location of the active gas injection while the temperature was constant at 30 °C ± 1 K. The experiments were done for 48 combinations of air and water superficial velocities varying from 0. 04 m/s to 1. 6 m/s for water and 0. 0025 m/s to 3. 2 m/s for air. From the raw data time averaged data as: radial gas volume fraction profiles, bubble size distributions, radial volume fraction profiles decomposed according to the bubble size and the radial profiles of the gas velocity were calculated. All data were checked regarding their consistency. They are characterized by a high resolution in space what makes them suitable for the development and validation of CFD-grade closure models, e. g. for bubble forces and coalescence and break-up. It is also an ideal base to validate CFD approaches for poly-dispersed flow. For this reason it is proposed to use the database as a benchmark for modelling poly-dispersed flows. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Injection {{pultrusion}} is {{a continuous}} process for manufacturing composite materials. To produce good quality parts {{it is essential}} that complete wet out of the reinforcement fibers is achieved in the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber.</b> To achieve good wet out of the fibers, the magnitude of the resin injection pressure is extremely important. The present study is focused on the effects of pull speed, fiber volume fraction, resin viscosity and compression ratio (taper) of the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> on resin fiber wet out within the <b>injection</b> <b>chamber</b> for polyester–glass roving composites. The recommended injection pressures for complete wet out are predicted for a wide and comprehensive variety of processing variables; this work is novel in that it has new and comprehensive results not available in the existing literature. Darcy’s law is used to model the fiber/resin system of injection pultrusion. Th...|$|E
