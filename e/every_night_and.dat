5|$|The Berlioz {{version was}} first {{presented}} at the Théâtre Lyrique on 18 November 1859 with Viardot as Orphée, Marie Sasse as Eurydice, Marie Ernestine Marimon as L'Amour, Mlle Moreau as L'Ombre, and Adolphe Deloffre as the conductor. The sets were designed by Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry, and the choreography was by Lucien Petipa. (The seventeen-year-old Jules Massenet was the orchestra's timpanist. During the rehearsals Berlioz had complimented the young player on the accuracy of his tuning.) The production was a popular and critical success, filling the house <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> was given a total of 138 times by the company.|$|E
5|$|Until 1999, Metro ended {{service at}} midnight <b>every</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> weekend service began at 8 am. That year, WMATA began late night service on Fridays and Saturdays until 1 am. By 2007, with {{encouragement}} from businesses, that closing {{time had been}} pushed back to 3 am, with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight. There were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011, but they were met with resistance by riders.|$|E

5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; {{some of his}} novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Although the NK 6th and 7th Divisions had massed {{their troops}} {{primarily}} for the attempted breakthrough of the US 25th Infantry Division positions along the Nam and Naktong Rivers during their September offensive, the NK 6th Division continued its attacks on the area. North Korean artillery and mortar fire fell on Battle Mountain, P'il-bong and Sobuk-san, and {{during the period of}} September 1–6 there were strong local attacks and patrols by North Korean troops. The 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry, never succeeded in gaining complete possession of the southern parts of Sobuk-san, which would have given observation into the valley below and into the North Koreans' rear areas. The instability of the 24th Infantry made it necessary for Kean to order Throckmorton to send his only regimental reserve, E Company, north into the 24th Infantry sector along the Haman road to protect the right flank of the 5th Regimental Combat Team. In this position, E Company collected stragglers from the 24th Infantry <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> the next morning sent them back to their units. The US Navy then entered the battle {{in this part of the}} line, its destroyers standing off the south coast gave illumination at night by directing their searchlights against low-hanging clouds on Sobuk-san. One destroyer was on station almost continuously, supporting the ground action with the fire of six 5-inch guns. An artillery aerial observer directed this naval gunfire through the fire direction center.|$|E

25|$|The pool {{has come}} under {{criticism}} from environmentalists due to the massive amounts of fresh water it uses daily, raising concerns {{that the process of}} completely draining the pool <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> refilling it the following day was depleting the Floridian aquifers. In 1998 a solution was devised to drain the water back into the aquifer, using natural ground filtration, thus recycling the precious natural resource, while allowing the pool to maintain its fresh, clear water.|$|E
25|$|The church's cloister {{is now the}} Museo Regional (Regional Museum). Built between 1660 and 1698,(elcima) {{the monastery}} it houses {{was the first in}} the city, built by Franciscans to evangelize the native populations here. The {{architecture}} is representative of Franciscan style, with simple lines and decoration. The museum exhibits artifacts from the pre-Hispanic, colonial and post-Independence eras of this region's history. The Plaza de la Constitución and Jardin Zenea plaza (named after liberal governor Benito Zenea) were part of the atrium of the church and monastery. This area is crowded <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> all day on Sunday, when the municipal band plays dance music from the 1940s to the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> sat by it so he knew that she was waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|The Coast {{as it was}} called, also invented its {{own kind}} of dance hall, called a Barbary Coast Dance Hall. It was {{different}} than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> scores of robberies. And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe. Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it {{was referred to as}} the Paris of America. Drug addicts of the district could even buy cocaine or morphine at an all night Grant Street drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer. And during the 1890s San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.|$|E
25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours <b>every</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the machinery when the guards were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO to do two years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that all fit men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a more romantic and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had been a little known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|E
