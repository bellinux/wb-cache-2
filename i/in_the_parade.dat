5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parade,</b> not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E
