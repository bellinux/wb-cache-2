50|$|The CAMEL Application Part (CAP) portable, {{software}} provides {{mechanisms to}} support operator services beyond the standard GSM services for subscribers roaming within {{or outside the}} <b>Home</b> <b>PLMN</b> (HPLMN). The CAP product extends the IN framework to GSM/3G networks for implementing IN-based services within GSM/3G networks.|$|E
50|$|Usually, GRX {{is based}} on a private or public IP {{backbone}} and uses GPRS Tunnelling Protocol on the session layer (OSI Layer Five) between the visited PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) and the <b>home</b> <b>PLMN.</b> Each GRX operator will have a network consisting of a set of routers and links connecting to the GPRS networks, moreover the GRX network will have links connecting to other GRX nodes in peer model.|$|E
50|$|The GRX {{operator}} {{can therefore}} {{act as a}} hub, allowing a GPRS subscriber to interconnect with many roaming partners {{without the need for}} dedicated links. For operators this is advantageous in that it allows quicker implementation of roaming partners, faster time to market for new operators and lower capital expenditure seeing as it is a scalable solution depending on bandwidth and quality of service requirements. Because the interconnection between the visited PLMN and <b>home</b> <b>PLMN</b> uses private GRX networks there is also no need to maintain Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels over the public internet.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to provide {{end to end}} encryption within the fixed infrastructure of Home PubHc Land Mobile Network (<b>Home</b> <b>PLMN)</b> and link by link encryption within the GSM PLMN. A new proposal for an authentication protocol for inter PLMN identity and technique for key distribution, achieves end to end encryption and link by hnk encryption across the GSM network. As a consequence of this, the GSM mobile phone user 2 Ì† 7 s voice can be completely protected from one point of communication to the other communication point. The receiving end may be within the same home mobile network or {{may be in a}} different network but within the GSM service area. We also propose a formal authentication protocol to set up inter PLMN calls, which solves the Border problem, as without the permission or awareness of the <b>Home</b> <b>PLMN,</b> no one can send any encrypted message. However it does provide complete encryption between different mobile networks within the GSM service area. Our proposal {{attempts to}} secure the location update between two Visitor Location Register (VLR) locations of a <b>Home</b> <b>PLMN</b> and also to secure international location update between inter PLMN of GSM PLMN, by encrypting important subscriber data being transferred between them...|$|E
