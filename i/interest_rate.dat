5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. <b>Interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity {{asserts that}} an {{investor}} with dollar deposits will earn the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{available in the}} eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity approximation.|$|E

5|$|Covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> and the foreign <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E
5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} {{is a theory}} of the market <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> According to this approach, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{is determined by the}} demand for and supply of loanable funds. The term loanable funds includes all forms of credit, such as loans, bonds, or savings deposits.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity.|$|E

In the article we analyze the sources of the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> fluctuations in the Visegrad countries in order to identify the impact of the inflation expectations and expected real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> of the interbank deposits with different maturity using structural vector autoregression (SVAR).

40|$|Understanding {{the links}} between long and {{short-term}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is crucial for monetary policy makers, since Central Banks decide and set short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in order to affect indirectly long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which affects aggregate spending. This paper studies whether VAR/VEC models are useful in predicting long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> for Brazil. The empirical results suggest that these models are useful in building qualitative scenarios for the Term structure of <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> but do not provide good forecasts in terms of accuracy.

5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E
