5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|Two free {{practice}} sessions were held before qualifying, running for 45 and 30 minutes respectively. The first session started at 08:15 local time, with Sébastien Buemi topping the timesheets for e.dams-Renault {{in a time}} of 1:23.158. The track got faster as the temperatures rose and more cars <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the circuit; lap times improved by more than a second in the second session, which started at 10:30. This time, it was championship leader Lucas di Grassi who topped the timesheets with a lap time of 1:22.032.|$|E
5|$|Mose Wright {{stayed on}} his front porch for twenty minutes waiting for Till to return. He did {{not go back to}} bed. He and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> trying to find Till. Unsuccessful, they {{returned}} home by 8:00am. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} {{that by the end of}} the 18th century around 100,000 cattle and 750,000 sheep arrived each year at London's Smithfield market from the surrounding countryside. Railways brought an end to most <b>droving</b> <b>around</b> the middle of the 19th century.|$|R

40|$|Soldier crab Dotilla myctiroides is a known burrower {{and form}} dense aggregations called <b>droves</b> <b>around</b> {{tropical}} muddy or sandy beaches including mangrove swamps. Due to their burrowing and feeding activities, {{one can see}} deposition of pseudofaecal and excavated pellets of moist sand around their burrows. Hence they are also known as sand bubbler crab. During the low tide they remain buried inside the burrows...|$|R
5|$|The C5 was {{launched}} on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with girls handing out press packs {{and a variety}} of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by girls dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a £3 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of £399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, {{low-speed}} film that required {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming {{took place in the}} farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E

50|$|The round is {{best remembered}} for a {{qualifying}} incident where all twelve {{cars in the}} second part of qualifying <b>drove</b> slowly <b>around</b> the lap before what was supposed to be their final flying lap. The cars <b>drove</b> slowly <b>around</b> the lap in order to ensure themselves a slipstream for the next lap but all of them missed the checkered flag. A total of fourteen drivers were penalised after the session which drastically reshuffled the grid.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} house not far distant, {{and getting the}} sleigh, Mr. Sumner placed Hal's form into it, and <b>drove</b> him <b>around</b> to the door.|$|R
5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic of backing the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety car line, while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced to collide with the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted in the safety car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the inside of him but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E
25|$|Comedians French and Saunders {{also created}} spoof idents for their 2002 Christmas special in which, dressed as old women, they first copied the Acrobat ident yet came loose from their ribbons {{and fell to}} the ground while in a spoof of Hip-Hop, the pair <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> slowly in {{mobility}} scooters.|$|E

25|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 91. Ryan Newman {{edged out}} Scott {{at the line}} {{to take the lead}} on lap 92. Busch <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> Newman on the high line to retake the lead on lap 102. The third caution of the race flew on lap 158 for a single-car wreck in turn 2 involving Regan Smith. Edwards exited pit road with the race lead.|$|E
25|$|The 1,500 {{heavily armed}} police {{officers}} deployed to Soweto on 17 June carried weapons including automatic rifles, stun guns, and carbines. They <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> in armoured vehicles with helicopters monitoring {{the area from}} the sky. The South African Army was also ordered on standby as a tactical measure to show military force. Crowd control methods used by South African police at the time included mainly dispersement techniques.|$|E

50|$|The {{price paid}} by Hudson for this concept car was {{reported}} to be only $28,000. It was a curious mix of Italian flair with American flash. After the prototype was completed in September 1953, Spring and his wife <b>drove</b> it <b>around</b> Italy.|$|R
25|$|Berry's {{first job}} {{was at the}} Bath {{electricity}} board showroom, and then conducting home visits to show new customers how to use their electric ovens. She would typically demonstrate the ovens by making a Victoria sponge, a technique she would later repeat when in television studios to test out an oven she had not used before. Her catchment area for demonstrations {{was limited to the}} greater Bath area, which she <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> in a Ford Popular supplied as a company car.|$|E

Lynch was named to the 2006 All-Pac-10 team First Team. Lynch not only earned various awards, he also scored the game-winning overtime touchdown against Washington. He later called the run his favorite career highlight, after which Lynch spontaneously <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the football field in an injury cart, pretending to ghost ride.|$|E
25|$|Financing {{their own}} tour, the band <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> {{in an old}} RV {{borrowed}} from Sexton's father, and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door {{out of the vehicle}} was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire.

25|$|On May 30, {{more than}} 500 monks {{demonstrated}} {{in front of}} the National Assembly in Saigon. The Buddhists had evaded a ban on public assembly by hiring four buses and filling up and pulling the blinds down. They <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> the city before the convoy stopped at the designated time and the monks disembarked. This {{was the first time that}} an open protest had been held in Saigon against Diệm in his eight years of rule. They unfurled banners and sat down for four hours before disbanding and returning to the pagodas to begin a nationwide 48-hour hunger strike organised by the Buddhist patriarch Thich Tinh Khiet.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{experimenting with}} new modes of filming, using different directorial methods and techniques. A {{case in point}} is Ten, which was filmed in a moving automobile in which Kiarostami was not present. He gave suggestions to the actors about what to do, and a camera placed on the dashboard filmed them while they <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> Tehran. The camera was allowed to roll, capturing the faces of the people involved during their daily routine, using a series of extreme-close shots. Ten was an experiment that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. This new direction towards a digital micro-cinema is defined as a micro-budget filmmaking practice, allied with a digital production basis.|$|E
25|$|More {{than two}} dozen European leaders, {{including}} President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, were the main dignitaries to join {{the hundreds of thousands}} of Poles. Many planned alternative travel arrangements over land. President of Slovenia Danilo Türk <b>drove</b> <b>around</b> 850 kilometres during 16 April. President of Romania Traian Băsescu flew by helicopter to the northwest of his country before driving on through Hungary and Slovakia. Prime Minister of Estonia Andrus Ansip drove for 18 hours for 1,300 kilometres. President of the Czech Republic Václav Klaus used car and train to travel the required 525 kilometres. President of Slovakia Ivan Gašparovič drove 300 kilometres from Bratislava. President of Hungary László Sólyom and his Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai drove from Budapest. Former President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko and his wife set out by road from Budapest.|$|E
