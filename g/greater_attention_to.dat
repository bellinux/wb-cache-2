5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt but that the uprising would draw <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E

He was also an Ambassador of Hope for homeless animals until his death due to cancer in 2007. Amigo has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN, and received the Ambassador of Goodwill and Hollywood Life Breakthrough of the Year 2007 awards. In 2009, {{he was one of}} four potcake dogs honoured in a series of commemorative stamps.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the conventions of beauty, as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E

5|$|Charles I was a {{connoisseur}} of art, and paid <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. Charles had the castle completely surveyed {{by a team}} including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In {{the final years of}} peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue.|$|E
5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention to}} her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been held accountable for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E
5|$|Gilliam {{originally}} {{believed that}} Pitt {{was not right}} {{for the role of}} Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise. Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys release, however, Interview with the Vampire (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.|$|E

5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became more politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{foreign affairs}} {{during the second}} half of his Senate career, serving as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's dependence on foreign immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E

25|$|Modern classicism {{showed a}} lesser {{interest}} in naturalism {{and a greater}} interest in formal stylization. Greater {{attention was paid to}} the rhythms of volumes and spaces—as well as <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc.) while less attention was paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume. Greater attention was given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used.|$|E
25|$|In 1535, the Florentine {{engraver}} Benvenuto Cellini {{was paid}} 50 scudi {{to recreate the}} metal matrix which {{would be used to}} impress the lead bullae of Pope Paul III.

The biggest problem, however, was the severe vibration caused by unbalanced driveshafts when the rotors moved out of phase, and this could only be fixed by <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail on the part of BMW.|$|E
25|$|Robert Birrell has {{asserted}} that high immigration levels {{are being used}} by the Federal Government to stimulate aggregate economic growth, but that per capita growth is more important to Australians. Birrell concluded that high migration does not benefit existing residents, because it dilutes the benefit that can accrue from the export of non-renewable resources which form {{a large part of the}} Australian economy. As well, Birrell argues that a slowdown in labour force growth would require employers to pay <b>greater</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> training, wages and conditions of workers.|$|E

His paintings were elaborated with <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail, with <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> costumes and facial expressions.
