40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the incidence of pulmonary embolism as the cause of death in acute myocardial infarction; to define the anatomic and clinical profile of a subset of patients deceased by pulmonary embolism; to study the localization and characteristics of pulmonary emboli. An anatomic and clinical protocol was systematically applied to the dying patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted in a CCU of an University Hospital. Therefore, 193 patients consecutively deceased by acute myocardial infarction were studied. Sixty-four clinical parameters were evaluated together with 34 anatomic parameters concerning a very discriminative anatomic study protocol. The sole exclusion criterion for necrotic study was the lack of family consent; necropsy was thus performed in 77 % of patients. Therefore, we verified that the incidence of pulmonary embolism as the cause of death was 9. 8 %. Delay in admission as well as the interval between the onset of symptoms and death, were longer in the deceased by pulmonary embolism than in subjects showing other causes of death. Bradycardia was absent in pulmonary embolism patients, and asystole was the terminal <b>electric</b> <b>accident</b> in the great majority of cases; heart weight was greater, and biventricular infarction and right ventricular thrombosis were also more frequent in this subset of patients. In almost half of cases, pulmonary emboli were located in the main pulmonary artery, being multiple and peripheral in four.

The violation of the rules of use of electricity implies material damages, human injuries, and, unfortunately, very often, loss of life. According to the international statistics, <b>electric</b> <b>accidents</b> are the most fatal among the other kinds of accidents. This particularity is also confirmed 47 for Greece. The present article is an assessment of the electrocutions that happened between 1992 and 1996 to workers in the power industry of Greece. Specifically, data concerning the occupational characteristics of the injured person, the time at which the accident occurred, and its consequences are presented and discussed. The calculation of the accident frequency rate per 1, 000 workers, with special attention to fatal accidents, is proposed. Also, the structure of an information system for accidents is proposed.

50|$|Although {{they have}} lived as long as within a month of 20 years old, few live half that long and only around half survive their first year. Each year overall nesting success can be lower than 30 percent. Early {{mortality}} can be due to natural causes, relating to harsh weather conditions, or more often starvation. Young hawks are often parasitized by species such as Trichomonas gallinae, Protocalliphora avium, and blood parasites. Humans, unintentionally or intentionally are a threat to red-shouldered hawks, including hunting, collision with <b>electric</b> wires, road <b>accidents</b> and logging. A further common cause of mortality is natural predation. Raccoons, martens, fishers and large arboreal snakes can predate eggs, hatchlings, fledgings and occasionally incubating and brooding adults. Non-nesting adults, being a fairly large and powerful predator, have fewer natural predators, but (both {{during and after the}} breeding season as well among nestling hawks) they may be predated by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, barred owls, other red-shouldered hawks, northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons, and bald and golden eagles. In western New York, the main cause of nest failure was stated to be great horned owl predation. Many of the same predators sometimes compete over territory and food with this species. Despite their highly similar diet and habitat preferences, it has been found that red-shouldered hawks can nest within 48 m barred owl without interspecies conflict. In Florida, red-shouldered hawks sometimes collaborate and peaceably coexist with American crows (usually an enemy to all other birds because of their egg-hunting habits) so they cooperatively mob mutual predators, mainly great horned owls and red-tailed hawks.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of bacterial flora in the Hanuman langur (Presbytis entellus) of the Gujarat state Material and Methods: Thirty hanuman langur (Presbytis entellus) (20 male and 10 female), were screened for bacterial flora {{during the period of}} June, 2010 to March, 2011. Hanuman langur (Presbytis entellus) were screened by culture of nasal, oral and rectal swabs during routine health monitoring and samples incubated using appropriate media and specific selective culture methods. Bacterial organisms from the normal as well of affected with various diseases and disorders conditions viz. infected wound, <b>electric</b> shock, road <b>accident,</b> jaw injury, stomatitis, respiratory infection and diarrhea were subcultured and identified for genus and species. Results: Significant normal pathogens of the nasal and oral swabs were found mainly Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. whereas from the rectal swabs of hanuman langur the significant pathogen noted were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., E. coli spp., Salmonella spp., Proteus vulgaris spp., Klebsiella spp. and Shigella spp. The serotypes of E. coli isolated from rectal swabs of hanuman langur were identified as rough type, O 138 and O 20. The major antigenic structure of E. coli revealed O 138 (10), O 20 (6) with rough types (2). Out of the total 10 cases of diarrhea O 138 was observed from five isolates while O 20 recorded from 3 cases. Out of remained two isolates one isolate of diarrhea revealed rough type and one revealed non typing antigenic structure. Conclusion: The bacteriological prevalence in healthy and infected hanuman langurs in Gujarat reported for the first time inthe current study may serve as a guideline for future studies in the same species.
