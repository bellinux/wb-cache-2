500|$|During the game, Bob Sudyk, a {{reporter}} for the Cleveland Press, interviewed Adams and asked {{if he was going to}} drum again at the following game. Adams said no, but Sudyk wrote in his article that he would. According to Adams, [...] "not to make a liar out of Bob, <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> with my drum, and then I came to the next game and the next game and the next game." [...] The Indians' promotions director at the time, Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the video, Jackson shows {{a sexual}} {{attraction}} towards the dancing woman—played by Sybil Azur. Jackson caresses her ankle, calf, knee and thigh, {{and at one}} stage looks up her dress. The woman is then seen opening a flick knife as the pair engage in a final courtship dance. The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see what they like, or the potential in somebody, but what I do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E

2500|$|In The Other Hollywood, Boreman {{said she}} felt [...] "used" [...] by the anti-pornography movement.

5000|$|Haney {{would often}} {{turn up in}} his 1925 truck at the Douglas farm, minutes after they've {{realized}} they needed something, selling exactly that (even if it were very odd), complete with a pull-down sign on his truck advertising it.

6000|$|This was {{the best}} store we had come across yet; it had {{everything}} in it, in small quantities, from anvils and drygoods {{all the way down}} to fish and pinchbeck jewelry. I concluded I would bunch my whole invoice right here, and not go pricing around any more. So I got rid of Marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and the wheelwright, which left the field free to me. For I never care to do a thing in a quiet way; it's got to be theatrical or I don't take any interest in it. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> money enough, in a careless way, to corral the shopkeeper's respect, and then I wrote down a list of the things I wanted, and handed it to him to see if he could read it. He could, and was proud to show that he could. He said he had been educated by a priest, and could both read and write. He ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction that it was a pretty heavy bill. Well, and so it was, for a little concern like that. I was not only providing a swell dinner, but some odds and ends of extras. I ordered that the things be carted out and delivered at the dwelling of Marco, the son of Marco, by Saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time Sunday. He said I could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was the rule of the house. He also observed that he would throw in a couple of miller-guns for the Marcos gratis--that everybody was using them now. He had a mighty opinion of that clever device. I said: ...|$|E

5000|$|On April 10, Cliven and Ammon {{were interviewed}} on air by Fox News' Greta Van Susteren.

5000|$|A {{note from}} Rocky Frisco: It's {{my opinion that}} the real roots to the Tulsa Sound lead to Flash Terry and his band. Flash played at the Flamingo Lounge, on Greenwood.

5000|$|Kirby {{had done}} the New Gods, which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were {{inspired}} by that.

I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: [...] "Beef him up!

40|$|First, I {{would like}} to thank my advisor Sean Carroll. I must admit that I have been {{extremely}} fortunate to have an advisor who is so generous, patient, and resourceful. It has always been amazing to me how he can just put aside his work and patiently answer questions and offer advice whenever <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at his door in search of sage counsel. I thoroughly enjoyed, and have profited much from, the numerous exciting conversations on physics that we have had over the years. His support, guidance, and assistance have {{played an important role in}} my growth as a physicist. In addition to Sean, I am grateful to my other collaborators — Tim Dulaney, Moira Gresham, and Ingunn Wehus — without whom this thesis would not have been possible. Over the years, I have also benefitted much from discussions on cosmology and gravity with others on the 4 th floor of Lauritsen, in particular Lotty Ackerman, Matt Johnson...|$|R
