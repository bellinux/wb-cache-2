A demand model is specified and estimated. The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R

Alternative energy such as solar energy, heat pumps, hot water heat recycling, and geothermal heating can also heat water, often in combination with backup systems powered by fossil fuels or electricity.|$|R
