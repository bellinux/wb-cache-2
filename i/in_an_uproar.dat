5|$|The city {{immediately}} sued {{to prevent}} the move, {{on the basis that}} the lease of the stadium was active until 1998. Fans were <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar,</b> staging protests, signing petitions, filing lawsuits and appealing to other NFL owners to block the relocation. Advertisers pulled out of the stadium, fearing fans' ire. Talks between the city, Modell and the NFL continued as the Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. At the team's final home game against the Bengals, unruly fans in the Dawg Pound bleachers section rained debris, beer bottles and entire sections of seats onto the field, forcing officials to move play to the opposite end to ensure players' safety. Cleveland won the game, its only victory after the announcement of the move.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> over {{political}} and religious controversies, and the competitive system where professors were dependent on attracting student fees for income meant that the university was riven with argumentative feuds and conflicts. The monopoly held by established medical professors was challenged by private independent schools, with new ideas of teaching by dissecting corpses giving clandestine trade to bodysnatchers (just shortly before the Burke and Hare scandal).|$|E

25|$|The Sarandí, {{under the}} command of its captain, José María Pinedo, then began to patrol the {{surrounding}} seas. Upon its return to Puerto Luis on 29 December 1832, the Sarandí found the colony <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar.</b> In Pinedo's absence there had been a mutiny led by a man named Gomila; Mestivier had been murdered and his wife raped. The captain of the French vessel Jean Jacques had meanwhile provided assistance, disarming and incarcerating the mutineers. Pinedo dispatched the mutineers to Buenos Aires with the British schooner Rapid. Gomila was condemned to exile, while seven other mutineers were executed.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt {{there was no need}} to call on Orfila to do it. The president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what they would say. The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E
25|$|Tuesday 1stMay. Hazy, raw. Yesty {{was very}} {{unfavorable}} {{for the general}} moving of our great city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, sideboards, looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feby is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N York is literally <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> for several days before & after the 1stofMay. This practice of move all, to strangers appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feby quarter.|$|E

25|$|This {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> among local politicians, who {{in unison}} stated that cars {{were not a}} suitable means of transport, particularly for freight. They further stated that the investments would have been wasted and that the state would have to compensate the area with additional infrastructure, such as a NOK400,000 upgrade to the road between Gartland and Høylandet and NOK300,000 to Nes Bridge. Parliament intervenes and passed legislation pm 19 May 1928 for construction to continue. However, this involved a reduction of the line's standard. The most drastic reduction was {{a reduction in the}} rail profile from 35 to 25 kilograms per meter (70 to 50lb/yd) and the choice of used track. In addition, the line was equipped with ballast of gravel rather than crushed stone. Both contributed in giving a lower axle load, resulting in only lighter locomotives being able to use the line and reducing train sizes.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1744 Edwards, in his sermons on Religious Affections, had plainly intimated his dislike of this practice. In the same year, he had {{published}} in a church meeting the names of certain young people, members of the church, who were suspected of reading improper books, and also {{the names of those}} who were to be called as witnesses in the case. It has often been reported that the witnesses and accused were not distinguished on this list, and so the entire congregation was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar.</b> However, Patricia Tracy's research has cast doubt on this version of the events, noting that in the list he read from, the names were definitely distinguished. Those involved were eventually disciplined for disrespect to the investigators rather than for the original incident. In any case, the incident further deteriorated the relationship between Edwards and the congregation.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{downgrading}} of the Straits Settlements, {{the offices}} of Governor and Resident Councillors were abolished. This led Governor Fullerton to conclude that neither he nor the Resident Councillors were empowered any longer to administer justice under the Second Charter. In late 1830, Fullerton closed the courts and dismissed the judicial establishment before leaving for England. This led to legal chaos. Members of the mercantile community were <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> as they felt the ensuing confusion and inconvenience of having no local courts would disrupt commercial activity. In Singapore the Deputy Resident Murchison felt compelled to convene a court. However, the Acting Registrar James Loch took {{the view that the}} court was illegal, and it was soon closed again. In September 1831 merchants of the Straits Settlements appealed to the British Parliament. By then, the East India Company had already decided that Fullerton had been mistaken. It decided to restore the titles of Governor and Resident Councillor so that these officers could continue to administer justice pursuant to the Charter. On 9 June 1832 the Court of Judicature reopened at Prince of Wales' Island, and disposed of many outstanding cases that had amassed during the two years when the courts were closed.|$|E

500|$|Turpin is {{best known}} for his {{exploits}} as a highwayman, but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737, when a broadsheet entitled [...] "News news: great and wonderful news from London <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin, with his escape into Ireland" [...] was published. [...] Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of chapbooks, names such as James Hind, Claude Duval and William Nevison, are not nearly as well-known today as the legend of Dick Turpin, whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century. [...] It was, however, the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th-century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel Rookwood. [...] Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device, describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book's other characters. [...] Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer, and is later forced to escape on his horse, Black Bess. [...] Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit, Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey. [...] This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work, and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing, the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin. The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth's story, publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin's career.|$|E

[...] He later denied, according to the Nairobi Star.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly.

2500|$|An {{interview}} with J.K.

During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were [...] "delusional", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were [...] "still valued members of her readership". This incident resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> among Harry/Hermione shippers. Many of them complained that both sites had a Ron/Hermione bias and criticised Rowling for not including a representative of their community, as a way to avoid difficult questions. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|E
2500|$|In Section Two, [...] "The Material", Cleckley {{presents}} a typical [...] "full" [...] psychopath's {{behavior in a}} series of 15 vignettes (originally nine in the first edition, and all male). For example, the psychopath can typically tell vivid, lifelike, plausible stories that are completely fraudulent, without evincing any element of delusion. When confronted with a lie, the psychopath is unflappable and can often effortlessly pass it off as a joke. In another typical case history, the psychopath is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment but because of his constant trouble-making, leaving wards <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar,</b> the hospital is finally forced to turn him over to the police. Eventually, the police become so sick of his repeated antics that they try to hospitalize him again.|$|E

We're all sexual beings, and if we don't let it out organically, we repress ourselves. If we repress anger, it turns to depression. If we repress our sexuality, it turns to pornography and rape.

2500|$|On December 17, 2013, Snowden {{wrote an}} open letter to the people of Brazil {{offering}} to assist the Brazilian government in investigating allegations of U.S. spying, and added that he continued to seek, and would require, asylum. Snowden wrote, [...] "Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak ... {{going so far as to}} force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!" [...] Brazil had been <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>uproar</b> since Snowden revealed that the U.S. was spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, her senior advisors, and Brazil's national oil company, Petrobras. Rousseff and officials of the Brazilian foreign ministry said in response that they could not consider asylum for Snowden because they had not received any formal request. A representative of the foreign ministry said that a fax requesting asylum had been sent to the Brazilian embassy in Moscow in July but it had not been signed and could not be authenticated. David Miranda, the Brazilian partner of Glenn Greenwald, launched an Internet petition urging the Brazilian president to consider offering Snowden asylum.|$|E

Disgusted by the scene, Perasso allegedly grabbed a stone from the road and skilfully threw it at the Austrian patrol, asking his fellow citizens in the Genoese dialect: [...] "Che l'inse?"
