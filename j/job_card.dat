The WATFOR compiler could compile, link, and run a short program in the compiler's memory space in a few seconds. This compiler allowed the university to offer underclass programming courses not only to computer scientists but also to business majors and to other non-specialists.

The original purpose of "the <b>job</b> <b>card</b> system" is to support a person looking for a job. When a job seeker writes a "job card", the job seeker can understand his own work experience and employment possibilities while getting {{the advice of the}} career counselor. If a teacher utilized a "job card" for career education in this way, the student can understand his career better. Therefore, I recommend that a teacher utilize the "job card" for career education. However, 2 problems may arise. First, the teacher may have insufficient training and second, "job card" are not yet widely known in Japan. These problems have to be addressed for the successful use of "job card"...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Nigeria {{ranks among}} notable global {{exporters}} of crude oil. However, the refineries positioned for providing finished petroleum products have not met this obligation. Plant reliability {{is a major}} crisis amidst rising demands for petroleum products. Rotating equipment availability, a critical constituent of a petrochemical plant, is vital to ensuring refinery reliability. The aim {{of this research is}} to: 1. Investigate and identify the causes of rotating equipment failures in Nigerian refineries while also identifying shortcomings in the implementation of current maintenance procedures. 2. Propose a procedure to Manage Rotating Equipment Maintenance Strategy (MREMS) in the Nigerian refineries. 3. Develop a new Internal <b>Job</b> <b>Card</b> system for the rotating equipment maintenance departments of the Nigerian refineries. 4. Propose a model Framework and Approach for Training and People Development (FATPD) amongst other recommendations to optimize rotating equipment maintenance management in the Nigerian refineries. The research evolved around a case study of four (4) petrochemical industries. This was embarked upon to present empirical data on rotating equipment maintenance management practices. Also, survey questionnaires and interviews were adopted to complement data gathering. The research presents five (5) core empirical findings. Firstly, minimal maintenance activity takes place outside scheduled turn around maintenance leading to excessive corrective maintenance actions in Nigerian refineries. Secondly, <b>job</b> <b>card</b> system in the rotating departments of the Nigerian refineries is not efficient. Thirdly, core skill and competence of bottom level maintenance workforce was discovered to be inadequate. Fourthly, computer maintenance management system or computer support structures to optimize rotating equipment maintenance in Nigerian refineries have little or zero presence. Lastly, rotating equipment maintenance management practices in Sasol proves rewarding with the integration of condition monitoring into maintenance program. Computer supports have also been vital to achieving commendable equipment availability. Management commitment, driven by customer focus, ensures that plant reliability is restored on schedule. A procedure to Manage Rotating Equipment Maintenance Strategy (MREMS) was developed for the Nigerian refineries. This is expected to tackle the issue of low availability of rotating equipment maintenance and also assist maintenance personnel to review or evolve a more specific equipment maintenance strategy based on reliability-centred maintenance principle of condition-based maintenance. A new Internal <b>Job</b> <b>card</b> is also presented in this dissertation. It would also serve to support the MREMS procedure. The proposed Framework and Approach for Training and People Development (FATDP) have a huge potential to address skills and competency deficiencies, particularly, for bottom level maintenance personnel at the Nigerian refineries. Recommendations on the adoption and implementation of MREMS procedure, Internal <b>Job</b> <b>card</b> and FATDP were also presented in this dissertation. Master...|$|E

40|$|This study {{conducted}} in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, has indentified the problems being faced by dairy farmers due to scarcity of farm labour for agricultural and livestock production. The study {{is based on the}} data collected from 40 selected respondents involved in crop production and dairying in the study area during the year 2008 - 09 through primary survey. The study has revealed that the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has provided employment opportunities to rural workers and has checked the migration of farm labour from villages to cities and nearby industrial townships. All the eligible family member of landless dairy farmers had the <b>job</b> <b>cards,</b> but medium and large dairy farmers possessing agricultural land, prefer to work at their own farms. These farmers have reported that they were facing acute shortage of labourers during peak paddy planting and harvesting due to MGNREGS. The labour wages have increased significantly from Rs 60 to Rs 110 per day since the implementation of MGNREG scheme. It has been observed that milch animals of some landless/ small dairy farmers are being maintained by the children or aged family members, as majority of adult family members prefer the MGNREGS jobs to earn wages. These adult members have complained about not getting 100 -day wage employment as per provisions of scheme. The wage payments are also delayed after completion of work and they face problems in getting the <b>job</b> <b>cards.</b> The study has concluded that the minimum wages under MGNREGS should be increased cautiously keeping in view its impact on agricultural/ livestock activities.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{new approach}} for analyzing queuing models of material control strategies such as kanban, CONWIP and POLCA in manufacturing systems. In practice, these strategies regulate the flow of jobs at various stations of the manufacturing system {{using a combination of}} card loops and authorization signals. Queuing models of such systems are composed of closed queuing networks corresponding to the different card loops. Fork/join stations are used to represent the synchronization constraints imposed on <b>jobs,</b> <b>cards</b> and authorization signals. Analyzing these networks involves solving a set of multi-class closed queuing networks with fork/join synchronization stations and stations with general processing times. Since these networks cannot be solved exactly, approximate methods have been investigated. We propose a new approximate approach based on the node decomposition technique.

40|$|Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is {{considered}} as a “Silver Bullet” for eradicating rural poverty and unemployment, by way of generating demand for productive labour force in villages. It provides an alternative source of livelihood which {{will have an impact}} on reducing migration, restricting child labor, alleviating poverty, and making villages self sustaining through productive assets creation such as road construction, cleaning up of water tanks, soil and water conservation work, etc. For which it has been considered as the largest anti-poverty programme in the world. But the success of this Act depends upon its proper implementation. Thus, the present study attempts to critically examine the implementation process of this programme and its impact on tribal livelihoods i. e. to what extent MGNREGS has given justice in sustaining the livelihoods of poor tribal communities in a tribal dominated panchayat of Sundargarh district, Odisha. The study reveals that there is little impact of MGNREGA on tribal livelihoods. The faulty implementation strategy has ruined the spirit of this programme. Religion and street biasness and favoritism in case of distribution of <b>job</b> <b>card,</b> dominance of dominant families, defective leadership and improper coordination among the stakeholders have stood as major hurdles in this programme. ...|$|E
