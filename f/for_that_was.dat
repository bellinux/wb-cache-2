25|$|Meucci and his {{business}} partners hired an attorney (J.D. Stetson), who filed a caveat on behalf of Meucci with the patent office. They had wanted to prepare a patent application, but the partners did not provide the $250 fee, so all that was prepared was a caveat, since the fee <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> only $20. However, the caveat did not contain a clear description of how the asserted invention would actually function. Meucci advocates claim the attorney erased margin notes Meucci had added to the document.|$|E

Licence <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> awarded in the same December by the Swedish king. The company hired from Nykarleby a skilled master shipbuilder, Scotsman Robert Fithie, who had worked before at Djurgården shipyard in Stockholm. Fithie led at least three large shipbuilding projects in Turku during years 1738–1741. The first ship produced by the yard was merchant ship Fortuna. Fithie built a dredger {{for the city of}} Turku; after that he also managed dredging of river Aura in 1740 and led the river dredging operations for the following 20 years.|$|E

Unfortunately for the Queen and the Dowager Duchess, further investigations by Cranmer and the Council revealed that with the connivance of one of her attendants, Lady Rochford, Catherine had allegedly had an affair with Thomas Culpeper, one of the King's favourite gentlemen of the privy chamber, after her marriage to the King.|$|E

However, the most commonly cited figures are around 10,000.

500|$|An {{important}} {{by-product of}} the Gregorian mission was the close relationship it fostered between the Anglo-Saxon Church and the Roman Church. Although Gregory had {{intended for the}} southern archiepiscopal see to be located at London, that never happened. A later tradition, dating from 797, when {{an attempt was made}} to move the archbishopric from Canterbury to London by King Coenwulf of Mercia, stated that on the death of Augustine, the [...] "wise men" [...] of the Anglo-Saxons met and decided that the see should remain at Canterbury, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> where Augustine had preached. The idea that an archbishop needed a pallium in order to exercise his archiepiscopal authority derives from the Gregorian mission, which established the custom at Canterbury from where it was spread to the Continent by later Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as Willibrord and Boniface. The close ties between the Anglo-Saxon church and Rome were strengthened later in the 7th century when Theodore of Tarsus was appointed to Canterbury by the papacy.|$|E

500|$|In {{regard to}} Lithuania, Dmowski didn't view Lithuanians {{as having a}} strong {{national}} identity, and viewed their social organization as tribal. Those areas of Lithuania that had either Polish majorities or minorities were claimed by Dmowski {{on the grounds of}} self-determination. In the areas with Polish minorities, the Poles would act as a civilizing influence; only the northern part of Lithuania, which had a solid Lithuanian majority, was Dmowski willing to concede to the Lithuanians. His initial plans for Lithuania involved giving it an autonomy within a Polish state. This caused Dmowski to have very acrimonious disputes with the Lithuanian delegation at Paris. With regard to the former Austrian province of East Galicia, Dmowski claimed that the local Ukrainians were quite incapable of ruling themselves and also required the civilizing influence of Polish leadership. In addition, Dmowski wished to acquire the oil fields of Galicia. His support <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> however more lackluster than that for other regions, and he opposed Piłsudski's proposal of an alliance or federation with Ukrainians. From the Allied powers only the French supported Polish claims to Galica wholeheartedly. In the end, it was the actual fighting on the ground in Galicia, and not the decisions of the diplomats in Paris, that decided that the region would be part of Poland. The French did not back Dmowski's aspirations in the Cieszyn Silesia region, and instead supported the claims of Czechoslovakia. Dmowski since a long time praised Czechs as model for national restoration in face of Germanization, and despite his dispute with Czech political leaders, his opinion of the Czech people as a whole remained positive ...|$|E

During filming, Rand told Gerald Loeb that she disliked this style, ascribing this later to the fact that Carrere had trained as an architect, but not practiced architecture. She described his designs as copied from pictures of [...] "horrible modernistic buildings", and judged them as [...] "embarrassingly bad".

Arjuna felt weak and sickened at the prospect of killing his entire family, including his 100 cousins and friends such as Ashwatthama. Despondent and confused about [...] what is right and what is wrong, Arjuna turned to Krishna for divine advice and teachings. Krishna, who Arjuna chose as his charioteer, advised him of his duty. This conversation forms the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most respected religious and philosophical texts in the Hindu religion. Krishna instructs Arjuna not to yield to degrading impotence and to fight his kin, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the only way to righteousness. He also reminded him that this was a war between righteousness and unrighteousness (dharma and adharma) and it was Arjuna's duty to slay anyone who supported the cause of unrighteousness, or sin. Krishna then revealed his divine form and explained that he is born on earth in each aeon when evil raises its head. It also forms one of the foremost treatise on the several aspects of Yoga and mystical knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|After {{yet another}} dismal {{performance}} in , the Mariners managed their first winning season in , finishing 83–79 under manager Jim Lefebvre.

The team hired Bill Plummer as Lefebvre's replacement for the [...] season, but he too was let go after a 98-loss campaign in 1992. Much of the reason <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> trading away pitchers Bill Swift, Mike Jackson and Dave Burba to the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Kevin Mitchell and pitcher Mike Remlinger. Bill Swift {{would go on to}} win the ERA title in 1992 and finish 2nd in Cy Young voting in 1993, Mike Jackson would have a solid career as a relief pitcher and Burba would pitch well as both a reliever and starter. While Kevin Mitchell had a solid year in 1992, he would be traded the next season to Cincinnati for Norm Charlton and Mike Remlinger didn't even play in a Mariner uniform. After several years of relocation threats by owner Jeff Smulyan, {{in the middle of the}} 1992 season, the Mariners were purchased by a group of Seattle-area businessmen, led by Nintendo chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi. The purchase was initially opposed by baseball officials, who objected to a team being owned by a non-North American entity.
