The impact of water-efficient fixtures and appliances, as required by current building codes in Queensland, is also explored. The four peak demand days selected had increasing peak day factors of 1. 3, 1. 5, 1. 6 and 1. 7. The range of these values is slightly lower than those used in the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) guidelines where the peak day factors range from 1. 5 to 2. 3, suggesting that the frequency and volume of peaking factors may be lower than those that are currently being used for network distribution design; due likely to the high penetration of water-efficient technology and growing water conservation awareness by consumers. This type of knowledge can facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the subsequent deferral of such assets. In terms of water-related energy demand, {{it was found that}} the hot water components of showers, and to a lesser extent, taps and clothes washers were the most influential. Shower energy consumption for <b>electric</b> <b>cylinder</b> hot water systems (HWS) and solar electric-boosted HWS was 810 and 351 kWh/p/year, respectively. The type of hot water system was significant in dictating the volume of energy-related carbon emissions, with the results confirming the significant impact that electric storage water heating has on total household energy consumption and related carbon emissions. Substantial savings can be achieved by substituting water (eg, high star rating clothes washers and shower heads) and energy (eg, solar hot water system) efficient appliances in the home.

40|$|Electric {{hot water}} tanks play {{a pivotal role}} as demand {{response}} assets within the UK's energy system by storing heat when energy is inexpensive and delivering domestic hot water when it is required. This role will become increasingly important if non-dispatchable renewable energy sources are to play a bigger part in the energy mix. Historically, the design standards relating to hot water tanks have focused primarily on minimising heat losses. However, in addition to preserving energy, a hot water tank should preserve the availability of heat above a useful temperature {{for as long as}} possible to avoid energy usage during peak times when it is costly or carbon intensive. To do this, thermal stratification within hot water tanks must be promoted. Unfortunately, thermal stratification leads to conditions that are conducive to bacterial growth due to the hospitable temperatures that arise during operation. For this reason, question marks have arisen over the extent to which more flexible control strategies, designed to allow for increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy sources, might lead to the growth of pathogenic bacteria within hot water tanks. The objective of the work discussed in this thesis was to understand the extent to which there is a conflict between thermal stratification and bacterial growth in practice, whether this conflict can be resolved and the potential implications for electric hot water tanks operating on a time of use tariff. A small field study demonstrated that there is prolific bacterial growth within conventional <b>electric</b> <b>cylinders</b> and that this can be attributed to thermal stratification with a confidence of (P< 0. 01). Fitting a de-stratification pump, to enhance sanitary performance, resulted in a 19 % decrease in the recovery of useable hot water above 43 °C. Given that the tanks tested during the field study were made of copper, the consequences of alternative material choices on thermal performance were explored. It was found that the rate of useable hot water loss, due to de-stratification associated with thermal diffusion across the thermocline, could be reduced by a factor of 2. 7 by making the tank liner wall from stainless steel instead of copper. Further numerical work indicated that this improvement in stratifying performance was most significant for small tanks with high aspect ratios. In addition to de-stratification that arises due to vertical conduction, de-stratification due to inlet mixing was reduced by up to 30 % by installing a spiral diffuser into the base of a test cylinder. In addition, by lowering the immersion heating element to ensure there is sufficient heat transfer to the base of the cylinder, sterilising temperatures could be attained throughout the stored volume of water in the tank during heating. This showed that the conflict between thermal and sanitary performance within electric tanks could potentially be resolved. A bespoke tank, made from stainless steel and fitted with a diffuser, was built and subjected to typical draw cycles that reflect real world operation. These tests showed that more useable hot water could be delivered in comparison to a commercial off the shelf copper tank and consequently the utilisation of the Economy 7 time of use tariff would be enhanced. </p...|$|R

I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee, dactyl, &c., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the medium for inferior writers and themes, (especially for persiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect taste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself, and anyhow,) the truest and greatest Poetry, (while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in the English language, be express'd in arbitrary and rhyming metre, {{any more than the}} greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. While admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time play'd great and fitting parts--that the pensive complaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many of them, been inimitably render'd in rhyming verse--that there have been very illustrious poets whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately envelopt--and though the mantle has fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age--it is, not-withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended.

40|$|In this work, the {{electromagnetic}} interaction of plane waves with infinitely long metamaterial-coated conducting cylinders is considered. Different from "conjugate" pairing of double-positive (DPS) and double-negative (DNG) or epsilon-negative (ENG) and mu-negative (MNG) concentric cylinders, achieving transparency and maximizing scattering are separately achieved by covering perfect <b>electric</b> conductor (PEC) <b>cylinders</b> with simple (i. e., homogeneous, isotropic, and linear) metamaterial coatings. The appropriate constitutive parameters of such metamaterials are investigated for Transverse Magnetic (TM) {{and in particular}} for Transverse Electric (TE) polarizations. For TE polarization it is {{found out that the}} metamaterial-coating permittivity has to be in the 0 < εc < ε 0 interval to achieve transparency, and in the - ε 0 < εc < 0 interval to achieve scattering maximization. However, unlike the "conjugate" pairing of DPS-DNG or ENG-MNG cases, when the transparency for metamaterial-coated PEC cylinders are considered, the analytically found relation between εc and the ratio of core-coating radii, γ, should be modified in a sense that scattering from the PEC core is canceled by the coating. Furthermore, replacing ε by μ (and vice versa) does not lead to the same conclusions for TM polarization unless the PEC cylinder is replaced by a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) cylinder. On the other hand, scattering maximization can also be achieved in the TM polarization case when coating permeability μc < 0, whereas transparency requires large | μc | for this polarization. Numerical results in the form of normalized monostatic and bistatic echo widths, which demonstrate the transparency and scattering maximization phenomena, are given and possible application areas are discussed. © 2007 The American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} {{of the development of}} modern metamaterials, which are artificial materials whose constitutive parameters can be engineered to achieve special functions, and the coordinate transformation theory, has offered an unprecedented opportunity for realizing invisibility cloaking. Coordinate transformation theory predicts that by squeezing the space to form a "hole" in it, any object inside the "hole" becomes completely invisible from electromagnetic waves. A metamaterial shell can thus be designed to mimic this space squeezing and function as an invisibility cloak whose user cannot be seen by others. In this thesis, a systematic electromagnetic study of transformation-based invisibility cloaks is provided based on the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Analytic scattering models are formulated for studying ideal and non-ideal invisibility cloaks. The physics behind perfect invisibility that the coordinate transformation theory did not show is explored by analytically calculating the spatial distribution of electromagnetic fields. Firstly, it is shown that an external electromagnetic wave illuminating a cylindrical cloak will induce electric and magnetic surface currents along the 0 direction at the inner boundary of this cloak. These surface currents have no counterparts in the transformation theory because they do not exist before transformation. Secondly, the reciprocity of a spherical cloak is demonstrated by showing that radiation from an active device in the concealed region is confined in the concealed region. The mechanism is that the outgoing radiation will induce surface voltages at the inner boundary of the cloak that reflect all waves back. (cont.) These physical surface voltages provides a set of mathematical boundary conditions requiring normal D and normal B to vanish on the interface. Finally, the mechanical response of the cloak to external electromagnetic waves is analyzed by calculating the Lorentz force distribution. It is shown that an incoming plane wave tends to expand the bulk of a cloak while squeezing the outer boundary of the cloak at the same time. The recoil forces of these forces provides an alternative explanation for the bending of rays or photons. More realistic cases with perturbed constitutive parameters are analyzed. It is shown that under certain symmetric lossy conditions, the spherical cloak is still invisible for a back-scattering detector due to impedance matching, while a cylindrical cloak with the same lossy conditions is visible. More emphasis is laid on the effect of dispersion associated with metamaterials. By applying the Drude and Lorentz types of dispersion to the radial permittivity and radial permeability of a spherical cloak, it is shown that electromagnetic waves with different frequencies have different depths of penetration and thus form a rainbow-like field distribution inside the cloak. A quasi-monochromatic wave will experience a blue-shift in the forward propagating direction. Transmission of a Gaussian pulse through this dispersive cloak is discussed. It is shown that group velocity and energy transport velocity are not well-defined when the wave is approaching the inner boundary because the wave is seriously distorted. However, when the frequency band is narrow enough, we are still able to define the time-delay of the signal arriving at a target plane behind the cloak. (cont.) A counterintuitive volcano-shaped time-delay is demonstrated as a concrete example. An electromagnetic detection method is introduced for detecting a perfect cloak. While photons can be guided by the cloak along curved trajectories within the cloak, a moving charged particle will still follow a straight trajectory due to its inertia and thus generate radiation. We extend the previous Frank and Tamm's theory of Cerenkov radiation in isotropic and homogeneous media to the case of a perfect spherical cloak that is both anisotropic and inhomogeneous. From the transformation viewpoint, the radiation is from the nonuniform motion of the charged particle along a bent curve in the virtual space. The transition radiations that occur at the incident point and emitting point when the particle enters and leaves the cloak in the physical space correspond to the abrupt velocity changes at the corresponding points in the virtual space. The transition radiation during the piercing process in the physical space corresponds to the deceleration and acceleration radiation (Bremsstrahlung) and synchrotron radiation in virtual space. In our demonstrated spherical cloak with inner radius of 1 pm and outer radius of 2 /m, it is obtained that within the frequency range from 500 THz to 501 THz, a charge package of 1000 electrons moving with 0. 9 c can generate radiation energy equivalent to about 78 photons. The practical implementation is considered. For simplified cloaks that are often preferred in experiments, the influences of nonlinear transformation and incident angle are first studied. (cont.) It is seen that a square root transformation which forces the waves to be guided close to the outer boundary is more invisible than those generated by either linear or quadratic transformation. Simplified cylindrical cloaks may produce a larger scattering at nonnormal incidences than that from an object without any cloak. In addition, we suggest using a small number of homogeneous and anisotropic metamaterial layers to construct a practical cloak with satisfying performance with normal incidence and oblique incidence. Genetic algorithm was used to optimize the practical multi-layer structures. It is shown that using an optimized 4 -layer cloak, the normalized scattering cross section from a perfect <b>electric</b> conductor <b>cylinder</b> can be reduced from 2. 19 to 0. 0039 with normal incidence. Another optimized 4 -layer cloak working for the incidence of 30 ° is shown able to reduce the scattering cross section from 1. 175 to 0. 013. The latter cloak exhibits reduce scattering over a large range of incidence angles. by Baile Zhang. Thesis (Ph. D.)
