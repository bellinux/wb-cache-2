Argentina does not recognise the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' sovereignty referendum.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands,</b> off {{the south}} coast of Argentina, were {{simultaneously}} claimed for Louis XV of France, in 1764, and George III of the United Kingdom, in 1765, though the French colony was ceded to Charles III of Spain in 1767. By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain James Cook for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were {{governed by the}} British Crown-in-Council through the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands,</b> an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985.

5|$|In 1882 Great Britain was {{converted}} into a sailing ship to transport bulk coal. She made her final voyage in 1886, after loading up with coal and leaving Penarth Dock for Panama on 8 February. After a fire on board en-route she was found on arrival at Port Stanley in the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> to be damaged beyond economic repair. She was sold to the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> Company and used, afloat, as a storage hulk (coal bunker) until 1937, when she was towed to Sparrow Cove, 3.5miles from Port Stanley, scuttled and abandoned. As a bunker, she coaled the South Atlantic fleet that defeated Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee's fleet in the First World War Battle of the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands.</b> In the Second World War, some of her iron was scavenged to repair , one of the Royal Navy ships that fought the Graf Spee and was badly damaged during the Battle of the River Plate.|$|E
5|$|The 30th {{anniversary of}} the Falklands War took place in 2012, and Kirchner {{increased}} the anti-British sentiment in her rhetoric, reiterating the Argentine claims in the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> sovereignty dispute. British Prime minister David Cameron rejected her comments. Relations were also strained by recent oil explorations in the area, and Kirchner threatened to sue Rockhopper Exploration for it. The <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> celebrated a sovereignty referendum in 2013, where 99.8% voted to remain a British territory, with only three votes against. Kirchner ignored the referendum.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Spee led his squadron across the Pacific to the coast of South America. Here on 1 November, he defeated the British 4th Cruiser Squadron under Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock in the Battle of Coronel, sinking two of Cradock's cruisers and forcing his other two ships to retreat. A month later, Spee decided to attack the British naval base in the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands,</b> though a superior British force surprised him. In the ensuing Battle of the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands,</b> Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee's squadron, which included two powerful battlecruisers, destroyed the East Asia Squadron. Spee and his two sons, {{who happened to be}} serving on two of his ships, were all killed, along with about 2,200 other men. Spee was hailed as a hero in Germany, and several ships were named in his honor, including the heavy cruiser , which was built in the 1930s and was defeated in the Battle of the River Plate during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the Falklands served an {{important}} role in Britain's territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica. The Falklands governed these territories as the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> Dependencies starting in 1908, and retained them until their dissolution in 1985. The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as a military base aiding control of the South Atlantic. In the First World War Battle of the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> in December 1914, a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron. In the Second World War, following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate, the battle-damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs. In 1942, a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago. After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina.|$|E
