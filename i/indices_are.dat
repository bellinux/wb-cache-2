5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, yellow, or colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale yellow or brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.|$|E

50|$|When <b>indexing</b> <b>is</b> specified, the {{register}} {{defined in the}} instruction becomes the index register, and the source/destination is implicitly Register zero.

5000|$|The {{rationale}} behind developing a forward <b>index</b> <b>is</b> that as documents are parsed, {{it is better}} to immediately store the words per document. The delineation enables Asynchronous system processing, which partially circumvents the inverted index update [...] The forward <b>index</b> <b>is</b> sorted to transform it to an inverted index. The forward <b>index</b> <b>is</b> essentially a list of pairs consisting of a document and a word, collated by the document. Converting the forward index to an inverted <b>index</b> <b>is</b> only a matter of sorting the pairs by the words. In this regard, the inverted <b>index</b> <b>is</b> a word-sorted forward index.|$|R

25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the group velocity of the light is independent of polarization.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulae}} in {{this article}} are exact if logarithmic units are used for relative changes, or equivalently if logarithms of <b>indices</b> <b>are</b> used in place of rates, and hold even for large relative changes. Most elegantly, if the natural logarithm is used, yielding the neper as logarithmic units, scaling by 100 to obtain the centineper yields units that are infinitesimally equal to percentage change (hence approximately equal for small values), and for which the linear equations hold for all values.|$|E
