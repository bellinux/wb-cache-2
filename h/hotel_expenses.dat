The Symphony raised $300,000 to fund travel and <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> for the concert series. In addition to the Oregon Symphony, the inaugural festival presented seven ensembles within nine days, including the Albany Symphony Orchestra, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and Toledo Symphony Orchestra. Orchestras were invited based on their submitted program proposals. No other ensemble presented a program themed by a single topic. In February 2011, {{three months before the}} Carnegie Hall performance, The Oregonian reported that nearly half of the 1,000 tickets reserved for distribution by the Oregon Symphony had been sold. Kalmar later confirmed that 450 Oregonians traveled to New York City to witness the performance.|$|E

500|$|Questions about Farmer's use of {{taxpayer}} funds continued to dog him throughout {{the general election}} campaign. Democrats demanded that Farmer reimburse the state for <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> charged to the state while Farmer was conducting outreach activities at the KHSAA state basketball tournament and the Kentucky State Fair, both located fewer than [...] from his home. In May, the office of Democratic State Auditor Crit Luallen notified the Internal Revenue Service that Farmer had failed to report personal use of his state vehicle as income. A spokesman for Farmer's office said that the personal mileage had been tracked, but a department employee had failed to forward it to the state Personnel Cabinet for reporting; he added that Farmer would file amended tax documents and have deductions taken from his wages to settle the tax liability. The state Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Farmer in September based on an anonymous email sent to the Personnel Cabinet claiming that, after work hours, Farmer directed an agriculture department employee to purchase a small refrigerator with state funds and deliver it to Farmer's house. A department spokesman said Farmer spent {{a substantial amount of}} time working from a home office in 2010 due to a back injury and that the refrigerator had been moved to department offices in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner {{was quietly}} {{designated}} an alternate {{delegate to the}} convention as an original alternate had dropped out, and when Governor Warren learned of his selection, he [...] "erupted... furiously". Chotiner had volunteered {{to take care of}} many of the convention arrangements for the California delegation, and for the Warren campaign headquarters at the Conrad Hilton Hotel. Seeking to avoid a split with Nixon, who assured Warren that Chotiner was merely there to handle physical arrangements, the governor grudgingly allowed Chotiner to retain his roles. When the California delegation's train arrived in Chicago, the Warren campaign found that the buses which Chotiner had arranged to transport the delegation to its hotel were covered with [...] "Eisenhower for President" [...] banners—which the governor's supporters hastily replaced with Warren signs. Chotiner had an extra phone surreptitiously installed in the Warren headquarters so he could quietly communicate the latest developments to Nixon. He also remained in close contact with Eisenhower aide and future Attorney General, Herbert Brownell. Warren paid a courtesy call on Eisenhower, and later wrote in his memoirs, [...] "Imagine my surprise when the doorkeeper who admitted me to the general's suite was Murray Chotiner." [...] Eisenhower was nominated over Taft and Warren in a close, first-ballot victory. As a final indignity to Warren, it developed that Chotiner had overspent his budget, forcing the governor and others to pay <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> from their own pockets.|$|E
500|$|Escobar turned {{professional}} on September 1, 1930, {{in a fight}} card organized at the Victory Garden gym in San Juan. In this event, he defeated Luis [...] "Kid Dominican" [...] Pérez, {{who entered}} the fight as the Dominican Republic's champion, by knockout in the third round. In Puerto Rico, Escobar fought in 15 contests, before moving to Venezuela after the popularity of professional boxing declined in his home country. This move was motivated by Roberto Andrade, who provided transportation to the country. In Venezuela, he fought in Caracas, competing against José Lugo, Sindulfo Díaz, Rafael [...] "Moralito" [...] Morales, Pica Pica and Simón Chávez among others. On November 11, 1931, Escobar competed against Enrique Chaffardet for the Venezuelan Bantamweight Title, but lost by decision. After 17 fights, he returned to Puerto Rico and competed in five cards. But professional boxing suffered another decline in interest, which forced Escobar to work as an accommodator in baseball games three days of the week, generally on weekends. In the meanwhile, Tony Rojas, {{a friend of his}} managers Gustavo Jiménez and Arturo Gigante, convinced them to release Escobar of the contract which bound them. Since Escobar turned professional while he was still legally a minor, his father had to sign the unbinding agreement. After succeeding in this task, Rojas presented Escobar with a steam boat ticket to New York, which covered his food, clothes and <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses.</b> Escobar reached New York in early 1934, intending to [...] "obtain fame and honor" [...] for [...] " [...] motherland", there he was received by Rojas and professional trainer Whitey Bimstein. His first fight in the United States took place in Holyoke, Massachusetts on May 7, 1934. In this contest he was paired against Canadian bantamweight titleholder Bobby Leitham, defeating him by technical knockout in the seventh round.|$|E
500|$|The {{reassembled}} delegates {{had heard}} rumors that Harding was {{the choice of}} a cabal of senators. Although this was not true, delegates believed it, and sought a way out by voting for Harding. When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12, Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots, rising to 133 as the two frontrunners saw little change. Lodge then declared a three-hour recess, to the outrage of Daugherty, who raced to the podium and confronted him, [...] "You cannot defeat this man this way! The motion was not carried! You cannot defeat this man!" [...] Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee, a scheme Hays refused {{to have anything to do}} with. The ninth ballot, after some initial suspense, saw delegation after delegation break for Harding, who took the lead with 374 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 for Lowden (Johnson had 83). Lowden released his delegates to Harding, and the tenth ballot, held at 6p.m., was a mere formality, with Harding finishing with 672 votes to 156 for Wood. The nomination was made unanimous. The delegates, desperate to leave town before they incurred more <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses,</b> then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination. Harding wanted Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin, who was unwilling to run, but before Lenroot's name could be withdrawn and another man decided on, an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge, which was met with a roar of approval from the delegates. Coolidge, popular for his role in breaking the Boston police strike of 1919, was nominated for vice president, receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had. James Morgan wrote in The Boston Globe: [...] "The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday... the President makers did not have a clean shirt. On such things, Rollo, turns the destiny of nations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Use of [...] "shamateurism" [...] {{as a term}} {{apparently}} originated {{during an}} English tour of Australia in 1887–88, a venture from which certain amateurs, notably George Vernon, Andrew Stoddart and Walter Read, {{were known to be}} profiting. Long before that, the Grace brothers had been notorious for submitting excessive expense claims but, when an official enquiry was held into their activities in January 1879, the outcome was an official whitewash and they continued to profit. In the 20th century, there were cases of amateur players being given a nominal job, such as county club assistant secretary. Sometimes, there were allegations of surreptitiously paid bonuses over and above the bona fide travelling and <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> that they were entitled to claim.|$|E
2500|$|From March 2016, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly [...] {{received}} {{a total of}} 610 telephone calls of complaint regarding Masuzoe's alleged extravagant spending. Then in May of that year, the Shukan Bunshun weekly news magazine reported on issues regarding public figures' official automobile travel expenses {{and the use of}} political funds for family trips. Masuzoe was the focus of the reports on the use of political funds for family trips, and came under prolonged media criticism. Masuzoe held a press conference that month to apologize for having declared over ¥370,000 spent on dining with his family at restaurants in 2013 and 2014 as [...] "meeting-related" [...] expenses covered by political funds. Among these were <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses,</b> family vacation trips, artwork, comic books as well as the use of government vehicle to travel to his holiday home located in Yugawara, Kanagawa Prefecture. In the following weeks investigations into his activities uncovered further inappropriate spending of public funds. An investigation instigated by Masuzoe and conducted by lawyers determined that he had used ¥4.4 million [...] "inappropriately", but had not committed any crime. Masuzoe subsequently declared that he would refund the misappropriated expenses, but refused to resign over the issue.|$|E

60|$|A more {{substantial}} difficulty is, {{that one of}} the forms most frequently assumed by election expenditure is that of subscriptions to local charities or other local objects; {{and it would be a}} strong measure to enact that money should not be given in charity within a place by the member for it. When such subscriptions are bonâ fide, the popularity which may be derived from them is an advantage which it seems hardly possible to deny to superior riches. But the greatest part of the mischief consists in the fact that money so contributed is employed in bribery, under the euphonious name of keeping up the member's interest. To guard against this, it should be part of the member's promissory declaration that all sums expended by him in the place, or for any purpose connected with it or with any of its inhabitants (with the exception perhaps of his own <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses)</b> should pass through the hands of the election auditor, and be by him (and not by the member himself or his friends) applied to its declared purpose.|$|E
60|$|The vetturino {{usually takes}} the entire {{charge of the}} party, and {{provides}} for them in every respect,--that is, if they make the arrangement with him in that way, which they generally do, inasmuch as, since they do not, ordinarily, know {{the language of the}} country, it is much more convenient for them to arrange with him {{to take care of them}} than to attempt to take care of themselves. Accordingly, in making a journey of several days, as, for example, from Genoa to Florence, from Florence to Rome, or from Rome to Venice, or to Naples, the vetturino determines the length of each day's journey; he chooses the hotels where to stop, both at noon and for the night; he attends to the passports in passing the frontiers, and also to the examination of the baggage at the custom houses; and on arriving at the hotels he orders what the travellers require, and settles the bill the next morning. For all this the travellers pay him one round sum, which includes every thing. This sum consists of a certain amount for the carriage and horses, and an additional amount of about a dollar and a half or a dollar and three quarters a day, as agreed upon beforehand, for <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> on the way. Thus, by this mode of travelling, the whole care is taken off from the traveller's mind, and he has nothing to do during the daytime but to sit in his carriage and enjoy himself, and at night to eat, drink, sleep, and take his comfort at the hotel.|$|E
6000|$|So Dumas' {{literary}} {{career began}} with a defeat, {{but it was always}} a beginning. He had just failed with [...] "Lenore," [...] when Leuven asked him to collaborate in a play. He was utterly ignorant, he says; he had not succeeded in gallant efforts to read through [...] "Gil Blas" [...] and [...] "Don Quixote." [...] "To my shame," [...] he writes, [...] "the man has not been more fortunate with those masterpieces than the boy." [...] He had not yet heard of Scott, Cooper, Goethe; he had heard of Shakespeare only as a barbarian. Other plays the boy wrote--failures, of course--and then Dumas poached his way to Paris, shooting partridges on the road, and paying the <b>hotel</b> <b>expenses</b> by his success in the chase. He was introduced to the great Talma: what a moment for Talma, had he known it! He saw the theatres. He went home, but returned to Paris, drew a small prize in a lottery, and sat next a gentleman at the play, a gentleman who read the rarest of Elzevirs, [...] "Le Pastissier Francais," [...] and gave him a little lecture on Elzevirs in general. Soon this gentleman began to hiss the piece, and was turned out. He was Charles Nodier, and one of the anonymous authors of the play he was hissing! I own that this amusing chapter lacks verisimilitude. It reads as if Dumas had chanced to [...] "get up" [...] the subject of Elzevirs, and had fashioned his new knowledge into a little story. He could make a story out of anything--he [...] "turned all to favour and to prettiness." [...] Could I translate the whole passage, and print it here, it would be longer than this article; but, ah, how much more entertaining! For whatever Dumas did he did with such life, spirit, wit, he told it with such vivacity, that his whole career is one long romance of the highest quality. Lassagne told him he must read--must read Goethe, Scott, Cooper, Froissart, Joinville, Brantome. He read them to some purpose. He entered the service of the Duc d'Orleans as a clerk, for he wrote a clear hand, and, happily, wrote at astonishing speed. He is said to have written a short play in a cottage where he went to rest {{for an hour or two}} after shooting all the morning. The practice in a notary's office stood him, as it stood Scott, in good stead. When a dog bit his hand he managed to write a volume without using his thumb. I have tried it, but forbear--in mercy to the printers. He performed wild feats of rapid caligraphy when a clerk under the Duc d'Orleans, and he wrote his plays in one [...] "hand," [...] his novels in another. The [...] "hand" [...] used in his dramas he acquired when, in days of poverty, he used to write in bed. To this habit he also attributed the brutalite of his earlier pieces, but there seems to be no good reason why a man should write like a brute because it is in bed that he writes.|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{industry}} {{is one of}} the key players in Sri Lankan economy. With the long run internal conflict, Sri Lankan tourism industry had a negative growth in the last few decades. Not only that, but also due to global economic meltdown, almost all the industries all over the world are facing an extremely hard time. The increase of global warming, with its effects on North Pole glaziers, which have started to-meltdown, the entire world has started to be concerned on the concept of the "green house effect". With global economic crisis and the "go green" concept most of the industries have started to practice cost reduction and energy saving methods in order to make their industries profitable. The situation in Sri Lanka's industry has no difference from that and especially the tourism industry has started to implement such methods. In this thesis a case study has been carried out at one of the five star category resort type hotels in down south, Heritance Ahungalla, to analyze the pattern of energy consumption in that hotel in order to implement a method to reduce their production cost, as energy {{is one of the}} heights components in the <b>hotel's</b> <b>expenses.</b> The chilled water distribution system has been studied and the hotel was divided to five section based on that. Cooling load requirement is correlated with the number of occupied rooms hence the energy could be saved by introducing wing operation to the hotel room allocation system. A practical evaluation on wing operation was carried out only based on the energy consumption and a theoretical evaluation was also carried out based on both the energy consumption and the profit. Results showed the energy could be saved by introducing "wing operation" to the system of allocation of rooms in the hotel. With the wing operation, it is required to implement automatic operation of chiller plant as well as isolation of each wing from the hotel main system as the wing operation is highly cost effective. That could be achieved with introduction of building management system to the hotel...|$|R
