5000|$|Until recently, {{microscopy}} {{methods used}} in the characterization of these OPVs consisted of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). These methods are very useful {{in the identification of}} the local morphology on the film surface, but lack the ability to provide fundamental information regarding local photocurrent generation and ultimately on the device performance. To obtain information which links the electrical and optical properties, the use of <b>electrical</b> <b>scanning</b> probe microscopy (SPM) is an active area of research. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) have been utilized in the studies of electron injection and charge trapping effects, while scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) have been used to investigate electron transport properties within these organic semiconductors.Conductive AFM has been widely used in characterizing the local electric properties in both photovoltaic fullerene blends and organic films, but no reports have shown the use of c-AFM to display the distribution of photocurrents in organic thin films. The most recent variation of SPM devices include (tr-EFM) and photoconductive AFM (pc-AFM) [...] Both these techniques are capable of obtaining information regarding photo-induced charging rates with nano-scale resolution. The advantage of pc-AFM over tr-ERM is present in the maximum obtainable resolution by each method. pc-AFM can map photocurrent distributions with approximately 20 nm resolution, whereas tr-EFM was only able to obtain between 50-100 nm resolution at this time. Another important factor to note is although the tr-EFM is capable of characterizing thin films within organic solar cells, it is unable to provide the needed information regarding the capacitance gradient nor the surface potential of the thin film.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of organic}} {{photovoltaics}} (OPVs) could reduce production costs for solar cells because these materials are solution processable {{and can be}} manufactured by roll-to-roll printing. The nanoscale texture, or film morphology, of the donor/acceptor blends used in most OPVs is a critical variable that can dominate both the performance of new materials being optimized in the lab and efforts to move from laboratory-scale to factory-scale production. Although efficiencies of organic solar cells have improved significantly in recent years, progress in morphology optimization still occurs largely by trial and error, in part because much of our basic understanding of how nanoscale morphology affects the optoelectronic properties of these heterogeneous organic semiconductor films has to be inferred indirectly from macroscopic measurements. In this Account, we review the importance of nanoscale morphology in organic semiconductors {{and the use of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>scanning</b> probe microscopy techniques to directly probe the local optoelectronic properties of OPV devices.

The observed heterogeneity in local photocurrent poses important questions, chiefly what information is contained and what is lost when using average values obtained from conventional measurements on macroscopic devices and bulk samples? We show that in many cases OPVs are best thought of as a collection of nanoscopic photodiodes connected in parallel, each with their own morphological and therefore electronic and optical properties. This local heterogeneity forces us to carefully consider the adequacy of describing OPVs solely by “average” properties such as the bulk carrier mobility. Characterizing this local heterogeneity in the morphology of an OPV and the consequent variations in local performance is vital to understanding OPV operation...|$|E

The sub- 100 nm morphology of these materials is known to heavily influence their electromechanical properties {{and the performance of}} devices they are part of. Electromechanical properties include charge injection, transport, recombination, and trapping, the phase behavior and the mechanical robustness of polymers and blends. <b>Electrical</b> <b>scanning</b> probe microscopy techniques are ideal tools to measure simultaneously electric (conductivity and surface potential) and dielectric (dielectric constant) properties, surface morphology, and mechanical properties of thin films of conjugated polymers and their blends. rnIn this thesis, I first present a combined topography, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and scanning conductive torsion mode microscopy (SCTMM) study on a gold/polystyrene model system. This system is a mimic for conjugated polymer blends where conductive domains (gold nanoparticles) are embedded in a non-conductive matrix (polystyrene film), like for polypyrrole:polystyrene sulfonate (PPy:PSS), and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). I controlled the nanoscale morphology of the model by varying the distribution of gold nanoparticles in the polystyrene films. I studied the influence of different morphologies on the surface potential measured by KPFM and on the conductivity measured by SCTMM. By the knowledge I gained from analyzing the data of the model system I was able to predict the nanostructure of a homemade PPy:PSS blend. rnThe morphologic, electric, and dielectric properties of water based conjugated polymer blends, e. g. PPy:PSS or PEDOT:PSS, are known to be influenced by their water content. These properties also influence the macroscopic performance when the polymer blends are employed in a device. In the second part I therefore present an in situ humidity-dependence study on PPy:PSS films spin-coated and drop-coated on hydrophobic highly ordered pyrolytic graphite substrates by KPFM. I additionally used a particular KPFM mode that detects the second harmonic electrostatic force. With this, I obtained images of dielectric constants of samples. Upon increasing relative humidity, the surface morphology and composition of the films changed. I also observed that relative humidity affected thermally unannealed and annealed PPy:PSS films differently. rnThe conductivity of a conjugated polymer may change once it is embedded in a non-conductive matrix, like for PPy embedded in PSS. To measure the conductivity of single conjugated polymer particles, in the third part, I present a direct method based on microscopic four-point probes. I started with metal core-shell and metal bulk particles as models, and measured their conductivities. The study could be extended to measure conductivity of single PPy particles (core-shell and bulk) with a diameter of a few micrometers. In dieser Arbeit stelle ich zunächst eine kombinierte Studie der Topographie, Kelvin probe force Mikroskopie (KPFM) und scanning conductive torsion mode Mikroskopie (SCTMM) eines Gold/Polystyrol Modellsystems vor. Dieses System ist ein Modell für konjugierte Polymer-Mischungen, bei denen leitfähige Domänen (Gold-Nanopartikel) in einer nicht leitfähigen Matrix (Polystyrol-Film) eingebettet sind, wie zum Beispiel Polypyrrol:Polystyrolsulfonat (PPY:PSS) und Poly(3, 4 -ethylendioxythiophen) :Poly(styrolsulfonat) (PEDOT:PSS). Ich kontrollierte die Morphologie des Modellsystems im Nanometerbereich durch Variation der Gold-Nanopartikel-Verteilung im Polystyrol-Film. Ich untersuchte weiterhin den Einfluss der unterschiedlichen Morphologien auf das Oberflächenpotential mittels KPFM und auf die Leitfähigkeit mittels SCTMM. Mit den Erkenntnissen, die ich durch die Studien dieses Modellsystems erhielt, war ich in der Lage, die Nanostruktur einer selbst hergestellten PPy:PSS Mischung vorauszusagen. rnEs ist bekannt, dass die morphologischen, elektrischen und dielektrischen Eigenschaften von Wasser bezogen auf konjugierte Polymer-Mischungen, zum Beispiel PPy:PSS oder PEDOT:PSS, abhängig vom Wassergehalt der Mischungen sind. Diese Eigenschaften beeinflussen außerdem die makroskopischen Eigenschaften, wenn sie in elektrischen Bauteilen zum Einsatz kommen. Im zweiten Teil meiner Arbeit beschäftigte ich mich daher mit einer in-situ Studie von gespin- und gedropcoateten PPy:PSS Filmen auf Graphit Substraten in Abhängigkeit von der Luftfeuchtigkeit. Es wurde zusätzlich ein spezieller KPFM Modus zur Charakterisierung eingesetzt, der die zweite harmonische elektrostatische Kraft detektiert. Bei Erhöhung der relativen Luftfeuchtigkeit verändern sich sowohl die Filmzusammensetzung als auch die Morphologie. Ich konnte außerdem zeigen, dass die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit unterschiedliche Auswirkungen auf thermisch getemperte und ungetemperte PPy:PSS Filme hat. rnIst ein konjugiertes Polymer in eine nicht leitfähige Matrix eingebettet, verändert dies seine Leitfähigkeit.
