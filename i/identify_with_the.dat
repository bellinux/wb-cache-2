5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier. Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> present-day Mahabalipuram. Sadras near Mahabalipuram has been identified as the site of the port of Sopatma mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
50|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} (2009) found that {{professional}} employees (e.g. doctors, nurses, lawyers) {{were less likely}} to reciprocate PPCV when they strongly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> organization and weakly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> profession. Indeed, such workers' organizational identification and professional identification combined to alter the influence of PPCV on performance behaviors. The results suggested that PPCV had the most negative influence on professional employees' work performance when employees strongly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> profession and weakly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> organization.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{here that}} the author gives his {{interpretation}} of Ezekiel and also dates himself to [...] "era 921, the seventeenth year of Alfonso's rule in Oviedo".

5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins to <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and {{that the most important}} aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rush of {{starring}} in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, {{where he found}} Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> protagonist.|$|E

5|$|Terri Schuester {{is portrayed}} by actress Jessalyn Gilsig. Prior to her casting in Glee, Gilsig was an {{established}} actress {{in both the}} television and film industry, but had little theatrical experience. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought actors who could <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rush of starring in theatrical roles. For the first two seasons of Glee, Gilsig was billed as a contract player for the show. However, {{it was reported that}} Gilsig has been bumped down to a recurring character for the show's third season, set to air in September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not to <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted {{that it did not}} believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote his opinions and increase his viewership.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} to <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half}} of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of writer-editor Stan Lee and artists/co-plotters such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, Marvel began its own rise to prominence. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, The Fantastic Four #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons, who squabbled and worried about the likes of rent-money. In contrast to the straitlaced archetypes of superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others complementing Lee's colorful, catchy prose, the new style became popular among college students who could <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> angst and the irreverent nature of the characters such as Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Hulk during a time period of social upheaval {{and the rise of}} a youth counterculture.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{formation}} of Northern Ireland in 1921, there has been tension and violence between its two main religious groups. Unionists/Ulster loyalists (who are mostly Ulster Protestant) generally want Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, while Irish nationalists/republicans (who are mostly Catholic) generally want it to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland. The former generally <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Union Flag, while the latter generally do not and instead <b>identify</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Irish tricolour.|$|E
