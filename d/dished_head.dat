40|$|The {{performance}} of a new pressure-relief structure in non-refillable steel welded industry cylinder is evaluated. Instead of a rupture disc welded on {{the opening of the}} head, this new pressure-relief structure uses a circular groove which is pressed by a special mold on the <b>dished</b> <b>head.</b> This structure not only avoids opening on the head but also reduces the manufacture cost. To ensure the safety of this pressure-relief structure, the study includes the material tests, tensile tests, hardness tests and burst tests, the limited pressure prediction are carried on.

40|$|AbstractPFBR, {{which is}} under {{construction}} in India, is a 500 MWe power, sodium cooled, (U-Pu) O 2 fuelled, pool type fast reactor. Beyond PFBR, it is planned to construct 3 twin units; each one is 2 x 500 MWe capacity sodium cooled fast reactors with improved economy and enhanced safety. Significant capital cost reduction is targeted by way of introducing innovative and improved concepts for the reactor assembly components, such as grid plate, primary pipes, top shield and fuel handling system and optimizing the main vessel diameter and bottom <b>dished</b> <b>head</b> shape. The improvements have been conceptualized based on preliminary analysis and the detailed analysis and development for few of the component have been undertaken. The capital cost reduction of the reactor assembly components that could be achieved through these improved concepts {{is estimated to be}} about 25 %. These apart, the safety of the reactor is enhanced by passive features in shutdown and decay heat removal systems. The innovations introduced have many unique features and it would form an international bench mark for the future FBRs. To validate these concepts, R&D areas have been identified and strategy to execute the R&D has been defined clearly. Towards commercialization of future FBR, special efforts are put forth to manufacture the components of the entire reactor assembly, which are non -replaceable, as a factory-made single item. In this paper, the basis of each concept to depict the Indian approach and strategy to make the fast reactor economically competitive is highlighted...|$|E
