25|$|The engine {{mounting}} was substantially different. Instead of being suspended from an alloy cradle {{as on the}} Mark A and B, the engine now sat in a steel cradle bolted to a steeply inclined steel tube that pivoted directly behind the engine through an alloy steering <b>head</b> <b>bracket.</b> This bracket, holding the engine and front wheel unit is bolted to a cast alloy bulkhead which forms a major structural component of the car. The {{engine mounting}} {{was said to have}} been a regular source of failures on both the Mark A and the Mark B, and this new design was again the work of Granville Bradshaw.|$|E

50|$|The Church, {{dedicated}} to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary {{is one of a}} group of Romanesque churches in Western Slovakia. The first phase dates from first half of the 12th century, or even the 11th century AD. Around 1220 the church was extended to the west, and a tower built with a triple tiered arrangement of Romanesque window openings. Brick was used for this extension, as was the case at Dražovce church near Nitra.Other Romaneque features include a finely carved baptismal font, a decorative Tympanum over the west door and grotesque animal <b>head</b> <b>brackets</b> below the eaves of the roof. In 1280 the Church and the village came into the ownership of the Poor Clares and between 1364 and 1370 they made modifications to the church in the Gothic style.|$|R
50|$|Vinedale is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Pinetops, Edgecombe County, North Carolina. It was built about 1855, and is a two-story, double-pile, three bays wide, Greek Revival / Italianate style frame dwelling. It features a one-story wraparound porch; a hipped roof with wide, overhanging, flat eaves and a cupola; and curved window <b>heads</b> and <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a <b>headed</b> <b>bracket</b> through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective To {{develop a}} {{real-time}} recording {{system based on}} computer binocular vision and two-dimensional image feature extraction to accurately record mandibular movement in three dimensions. Methods A computer-based binocular vision device with two digital cameras was {{used in conjunction with}} a fixed <b>head</b> retention <b>bracket</b> to track occlusal movement. Software was developed for extracting target spatial coordinates in real time based on two-dimensional image feature recognition. A plaster model of a subject’s upper and lower dentition were made using con-ventional methods. A mandibular occlusal splint was made on the plaster model, and then the occlusal surface was removed. Temporal denture base resin was used to make a 3 -cm handle extending outside the mouth connecting the anterior labial surface of the occlusal splint with a detection target with intersecting lines designed for spatial coordinate extrac-tion. The subject's head was firmly fixed in place, and the occlusal splint was fully seated o...|$|R
50|$|Each street {{facade of}} the two-storeyed corner block is divided into six bays by {{rendered}} pilasters. Between is tuck-pointed brickwork and pairs of vertical sliding sash windows with projecting sills and <b>bracketed</b> <b>heads.</b> Above is a projecting cornice, and a parapet with open circular motifs and finials with four-sided triangular pediments, however the finials of the south wing have been removed. The parapet has higher bays in brickwork emphasising the ends and {{the corner of the}} two-storey block. The present awning is cantilevered, replacing an earlier posted version, and supports some timber farm relics. Above the awning is a row of small clerestory-like windows with arched brick lintels, which light the ground floor.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{over his}} <b>head,</b> on a <b>bracket</b> against the wall, was another bird, a great hawk, pitched forward on his perch, with wings wide spread and fierce eyes glaring downward, in the intense {{attitude}} a hawk takes as he strikes his prey from some lofty watch tree. The golden-wing {{by this time}} was ready to venture in. He had leaned forward with wings spread, looking down at me to be quite sure I was harmless, when, turning his head for a final look round, {{he caught sight of}} the hawk just ready to pounce down on him. With a startled kee-uk he fairly tumbled back off the window sash, and I caught one glimpse of him as he dashed round the corner in full flight.|$|R
40|$|What is materiality? And is it of a {{different}} order from semiosis? In this commentary I reflect on the place of materiality—that quality of material phenomena—and materialization—the processes by which such qualities are actualized in social life—in Matthew Hull’s brilliant book, Government of paper (GoP). The analytic materiality is central to Hull’s ethnography, both theoretically (it informs his engagements with James Scott, Bruno Latour, and contemporary linguistic anthropology, among others) and methodologically (it guides his ethnography and analysis). And yet, while Hull demonstrates the term’s pragmatic purchase, he never quite tackles what is “meant ” by it <b>head</b> on. 1 <b>Bracketing</b> whether this {{is in fact the}} point, in what follows I comment on what I think materiality and materialization do in Hull’s analysis, motioning to some issues this raises for linguistic anthropology. Let me start with the beginning of the end: the first endnote (Hull 2012 : 259; als...|$|R
40|$|March 2002; September 2, 2003 (Last Revised) This paper investigates {{questions}} regarding the saving rates by age brackets and aggregate savings, and then conducts a simulation analysis of the current account, from the I-S balances of households, corporations and the government. Saving rates of the old (65 years old and above) with publicly available data are high because of a selection bias in household head, that excludes the old living with younger family members and being non-head of the household. The paper estimates the true saving rates by age brackets rather than of household <b>head's</b> age <b>brackets</b> with taking the non-head households' member into account. Estimated saving rates of the old are still positive (about 10 % to 20 % which are less {{than those of the}} young) even after adjusting for the bias. The impact of aging on the aggregate saving rates will not be large if the future old people continue to save as the current old people. We forecast the current account in several scenarios, using data of demographic changes, the estimated aggregate saving rates, and the estimated interest payments of government bonds. It is of our particular interest whether the current account will turn to be negative by the rapid demographic change. It is found that the IS balances would remain positive under a condition that the government bond issues would be constrained by fiscal sustainability. 科学研究費補助金（特定領域研究） = Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{real-time}} recording {{system based on}} computer binocular vision and two-dimensional image feature extraction to accurately record mandibular movement in three dimensions. A computer-based binocular vision device with two digital cameras was {{used in conjunction with}} a fixed <b>head</b> retention <b>bracket</b> to track occlusal movement.

A plaster model of a subject's upper and lower dentition were made using conventional methods. A mandibular occlusal splint was made on the plaster model, and then the occlusal surface was removed. Temporal denture base resin was used to make a 3 -cm handle extending outside the mouth connecting the anterior labial surface of the occlusal splint with a detection target with intersecting lines designed for spatial coordinate extraction. The subject's head was firmly fixed in place, and the occlusal splint was fully seated on the mandibular dentition. The subject was then asked to make various mouth movements while the mandibular movement target locus point set was recorded. Comparisons between the coordinate values and the actual values of the 30 intersections on the detection target were then analyzed using paired t-tests. The three-dimensional trajectory curve shapes of the mandibular movements were consistent with the respective subject movements. Mean XYZ coordinate values and paired t-test results were as follows: X axis: - 0. 0037 ± 0. 02953, P = 0. 502; Y axis: 0. 0037 ± 0. 05242, P = 0. 704; and Z axis: 0. 0007 ± 0. 06040, P = 0. 952. The t-test result showed that the coordinate values of the 30 cross points were considered statistically no significant. (P< 0. 05). Use of a real-time recording system of three-dimensional mandibular movement based on computer binocular vision and two-dimensional image feature recognition technology produced a recording accuracy of approximately ± 0. 1 mm, and is therefore suitable for clinical application. Certainly, further research is necessary to confirm the clinical applications of the method...|$|R
