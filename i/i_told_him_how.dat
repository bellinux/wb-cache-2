25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the public}} {{response}} to Scott was generally favorable during the Paramount years, the film critics were less so, repeatedly making unfavorable comparisons to Lauren Bacall and Tallulah Bankhead, beginning with Bob Thomas' March 1945 comment about her screen test: [...] "Her throaty voice may well make Lauren Bacall {{sound like a}} mezzo soprano." [...] When the most prominent critic of the era, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, gave a bad review of You Came Along (1945), Scott's film debut, she recalled, [...] "Being very young and naïve at the time, I didn't know you weren't supposed to do such things, so I called him up and complained. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> hard everyone worked {{to make such a}} beautiful movie, and I couldn't understand how he could be so cruel. I must say he took it awfully well, and was very kind to me." [...] Nonetheless, in his review of I Walk Alone (1948), he stated, [...] "As the torch singer ... Lizabeth Scott has no more personality than a model in the window of a department store." [...] He also wrote of [...] "a frighteningly grotesque Lizabeth Scott, who is supposed to represent a cabaret singer" [...] in Dark City (1950).|$|E
60|$|It was {{necessary}} to my object to set the conversation afloat; and this was as good {{a way of doing}} it as any other. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> plainly <b>how</b> <b>I</b> had been employed during my absence.|$|R
60|$|I stood Ted a pint, and arter he 'ad {{finished}} it <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> just <b>how</b> things was. I didn't {{say anything about}} the watch and chain, because there was no need to, and when we came outside agin I 'ad engaged an assistant-watchman for ninepence a night.|$|R
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> feared; <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> Farnese had {{sued for}} Bianca's hand for Cosimo; how proudly and finally Cavalcanti had refused; how the Duke {{had insisted that}} he would remain at Pagliano until my lord changed his mind; how I had learned from Giuliana the horrible motive that urged the Duke to press for that marriage.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the {{soldiers}} in Bavaria hated the military service.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I {{had once}} come through when land and timber grants {{could have been}} picked up for half less than nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think it}} 'ud matter," [...] he mumbled. [...] "A fellow with tortoiseshell-rimmed specs asked me, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>How</b> was I to know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} Oscar back with me," [...] {{he said to}} Lucilla; [...] "and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> widely the two oculists differ in opinion on your case. He knows also that you have decided on being guided by the more {{favorable}} view taken by Herr Grosse--and he knows no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You are {{far more}} than a mere {{acquaintance}} in Allan's eyes,' said Midwinter. 'Having your permission to trust <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> have already <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> near and dear you are to me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{know what}} it was," [...] said Lapham; [...] "all I know is that {{when it came to}} the point, {{although}} I could see that I'd got to go under unless I did it--that I couldn't sell out to those Englishmen, and I couldn't let that man put his money into my business without <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> just <b>how</b> things stood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{at least}} Jabez thinks, Prince," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> the Israelites were {{sure that he}} would be Pharaoh, whereat he laughed and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been false to him. I have been false to myself, but never to him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> it was. When you drove me on--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> pleased I {{was that}} he should have been liberally treated, and then we fell into {{conversation}} about myself and the means of re-establishing my perfect innocence.|$|E
60|$|This {{appeared}} to me an easy task, and certainly one I was enthusiastic over. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> just <b>how</b> <b>I</b> {{had come to the}} canyon, and how I saw that the fire would surely cross there, and that a back-fire was the only chance. Then, carefully studying the map, I marked off the three miles Herky and I had fired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fer once I don't {{agree with}} you. I knew {{how it was}} with <b>him</b> so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>how</b> it was with you so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>I</b> know <b>how</b> it is with me, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{my cousin}} sleeps {{in the other}} room. He is weak and worn out. All the same, Allan, he wanted to kiss me. So <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> at once <b>how</b> matters stood between you and me, {{and that we were}} to be married in six months." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'He was incredulous. Indeed, {{he seemed}} to think I was balmy. But I offered to bring him {{straight}} to you. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much you had {{talked to me about}} him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Joachim[28] came {{round to}} see me at the hall last night, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> sorry I was to forego the {{pleasure}} of meeting him (he is a noble fellow!) at your pleasant table.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told the}} President about it, Uncle Jethro; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> sick Cousin Eph had been, {{and that you}} were going to give him the {{postmastership}} because he couldn't work any more with his hands." ...|$|E
60|$|But he put {{his foot}} on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said he {{reckoned}} he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I didn't; so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> just <b>how</b> to find the raft, and then he started.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jessie {{has gone}} home to rest, and Jane is with poor Clara, who has dropped asleep at last. I've sent for Steve {{and the other}} boys. There will be time for them later, but he so begged to see you now, I thought it best to come while this {{temporary}} strength keeps <b>him</b> up. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> it is, but he will not believe me. If he asks you, answer honestly and try to fit him a little for this sudden ending of so many hopes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who--Theodore? Yes; your papa came home, {{and managed}} matters his own way, sent {{off all the}} governesses, put John under that ignorant old nurse, and began the {{precious}} intimacy with the Fotheringhams, that led to such results. <b>I</b> could have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> it would be; but I believe he did repent of that!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the General was the peach. I presume you're {{acquainted with}} the average run of British generals, but this was my first. I sat on his left hand, and he talked like--like the Ladies' Home Journal. J'ever read that paper? It's refined, Sir--and innocuous, and full of {{nickel-plated}} sentiments guaranteed to improve the mind. He was it. He began by a Lydia Pinkham heart-to-heart talk about my health, and hoped the boys had done me well, and that I was enjoying my stay in their midst. Then he thanked me for the interesting and valuable lessons that I'd given his crowd-- specially {{in the matter of}} placing artillery and rearguard attacks. He'd wipe his long thin moustache between drinks--lime-juice and water he used --and blat off into a long 'a-aah,' and ladle out more taffy for me or old man Van Zyl on his right. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I'd had my first Pisgah-sight of the principles of the Zigler when I was a fourth-class postmaster on a star-route in Arkansas. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I'd worked it up by instalments when I was machinist in Waterbury, where the dollar-watches come from. He had one on his wrist then. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I'd met Zalinski (he'd never heard of Zalinski!) when I was an extra clerk in the Naval Construction Bureau at Washington. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> my uncle, who was a truck-farmer in Noo Jersey (he loaned money on mortgage too, for ten acres ain't enough now in Noo Jersey), how he'd willed me {{a quarter of a million}} dollars, because I was the only one of our kin that called him down when he used to come home with a hard-cider jag on him and heave ox-bows at his nieces. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I'd turned in every red cent on the Zigler, and I told him the whole circus of my coming out with her, and so on, and so following; and every forty seconds he'd wipe his moustache and blat, 'How interesting. Really, now? How interesting.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he swore}} so fervently by his Christ that I {{was sure he}} would never break the oath. After he had sworn <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I could not rest because of the strange fears which oppressed me.|$|E
60|$|As we {{returned}} towards {{the setting sun}} we had yesterday left behind us, and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> grieved I was {{to think that he}} had come home for my sake.|$|E
5000|$|I kept bugging {{a nearby}} club's manager to, please, please, {{please let me}} DJ there. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>how</b> to do it, even though I only had a small {{collection}} of records and one turntable at home. He let me play a lounge gig {{on some of the}} slower nights. He told me to 'play whatever the fuck you want, so long as they stay,' words I've continued to live by to this day. DJ Keoki ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One day, only {{a couple}} of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I showed him some of my African curiosities. Among other things I {{exhibited}} this powder, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> also <b>how</b> powerless European science would be to detect it. How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but {{there is no doubt that}} it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil's-foot root. I well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is lucky, indeed," [...] {{the girl}} said to herself, when he had finished, [...] "that I found {{that my father had}} left Nombre de Dios, and had come down to his house here; for, assuredly, the people would have made short work of these poor lads, had I not been here to aid them. But, after all, what can I do? My father would, I know, do {{anything}} for my sake; and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> this lad jumped overboard, to save my life; but there is one here greater than he, that terrible Inquisition. These boys are heretics, and it will be impossible to conceal, for any time, from the priests that they are here. Still, at any rate, for a time we might hide them; and in gratitude only, I would do all in my power for them." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> {{they had}} taken his father and bound him, and thrown him down, and tied him to the savage beast, and how he had been dragged along till his blood spattered on the {{pavement}} and his soul left him.|$|E
60|$|I was {{a little}} disappointed, I must confess, but {{thoroughly}} charmed by his good-nature too. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> I esteemed his good-nature; and said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character, for he had none.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was good}} enough to ask me this morning how you had fared, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> you had rescued my dame and daughter, and also how you had befriended Mynheer Van Voorden, and he at once asked me to bring you again to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> remember, <b>how</b> tired I {{was of the}} pernicketiness of my life; and amused {{him with}} a {{description}} of my Tank. [...] "You would hardly believe it, but I have never once heard the least faint whisper of water in it, and if I had been a nice, simple savage, I dare say I should have prayed to it. Instead of which, when one night I saw a star over the housetop I merely shrugged my shoulders. My mind was so rancid I hated it. I was so shut in; that's what it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{mother has}} not {{forgotten}} her cousin's age, and is {{shocked at the}} disparity between her and my poor brother. Indeed, a city-bred lady of her time of life, accustomed to London gaiety and luxury, would find but a dismal home in our Virginian plantation. Besides, the house, such as it is, is not Harry's. He is welcome there, Heaven knows; more welcome, perhaps, than I, to whom the property comes in natural reversion; but, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> doubt <b>how</b> his wife would--would like our colony," [...] George said, with a blush, and a hesitation in his sentence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am never happy. I {{know that}} it cannot be, {{that it will not}} be, as he would have it. I know that I am letting him waste his {{sweetness}} all in vain. There should be some one else, oh, so different from me! There should be one like himself, beautiful, strong in health, with hot eager blood in her veins, with a grand name, with grand eyes and a broad brow and a noble figure, one who, in taking his name, will give him as much as she takes--one, above all, who will not pine and fade before his eyes, and trouble him during her short life with sickness and doctors and all the fading hopes of a hopeless invalid. And yet I let him come, and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> dearly <b>I</b> love him. He comes and he sees it in my eyes. And then it is so glorious, to be loved as he loves. Oh, Mrs. Roden, he kissed me." [...] That to Mrs. Roden {{did not seem to be}} extraordinary; but, not knowing what to say to it at the moment, she also kissed the girl. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he must go, and never come back to me again." ...|$|R
