40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{plasticity}} of 4004 Al alloy and subsequently the productivity of 4004 Al foil, the research studied in detail {{the influence of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> degassing process on the refining effect of 4004 Al alloy, in which the impacts of four major parameters: gas flow, rotational speed, refining time, and stewing time, on degassing rate of 4004 Al alloy was systematically studied by using an orthogonal experiment methodology. Results show that the rotational speed has the greatest impact on the degassing of 4004 Al alloy, followed by gas flow and refining time; stewing time has the least impact. The optimum purification parameters obtained by current orthogonal analysis were: rotor speed of 500 r·min- 1, inert gas flow of 0. 4 mL·h- 1, refining time of 15 min, and stewing time of 6 min. Degassing rate using the optimum parameters reaches 68 %. In addition, the comparison experiments among C 2 Cl 6 refining, <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> degassing, and combined treatment of C 2 Cl 6 refining and <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> degassing for 4004 Al alloy were performed. The experimental data indicated that the combined treatment of C 2 Cl 6 refining and <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> degassing has the best degassing effect.

40|$|Both {{primary and}} {{secondary}} aluminium have to be refined, especially by barbotage process. To know better the mechanism of blowing argon through aluminium in reactors with <b>rotary</b> <b>impellers,</b> numerical modelling is applied.

40|$|Purpose: The {{most popular}} method of {{aluminium}} refining is blowing of refining gas through the liquid metal. The way the refining gas is {{introduced to the}} liquid metal significantly influences the time and course of degassing process. <b>Rotary</b> <b>impellers</b> {{seem to be the}} best solution, especially taking into account reaching good level of gas dispersion in the liquid aluminium. However, the construction of impellers also influences the obtained gas dispersion in liquid metal, especially considering the processing parameters such as flow rate of refining gas and <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> speed. Design/methodology/approach: To observe the phenomena occurring during the aluminium refining process physical modelling was applied. Test stand for such modelling was built at 1 : 1 scale with the transparent tank to observe the level of gas dispersion in the liquid. The built model has to fulfill the rules coming from the theory of similarity. Findings: The choice of optimal parameters is very important to the particular type of impeller. As a result of research the processing parameters were chosen to the appropriate type of gas dispersion. The most desirable type of dispersion is an uniform dispersion. According to the research the best impeller seems to be impeller No 1. Research limitations/implications: There are differences between results coming from modelling research and industrial test. So, the further research should be conducted with a chosen impeller in industrial conditions. Practical implications: From industrial point of view it is important to test the impeller construction and their geometry in laboratory before industrial test. It gives some ideas how the particular impeller will behave in industry. To control the process of aluminium refining and conducting it optimally it is really important to know its mechanism better.

40|$|A {{continuous}} hydrogen-removal method from aluminum melt, spray degassing, is presented. The equilibrium {{equation of}} this method is discussed theoretically. Theoretical equilibrium analysis shows that the final hydrogen content of the melt is only affected by the purging gas flow rate and the melt mass flow rate. The hydrogen content of the outlet melt always contains a constant during the whole degassing time. The final hydrogen content of the melt decreases with increasing purging gas flow rate and increases with increasing melt mass flow rate. Compared with the <b>rotary</b> <b>impeller</b> degassing method, spray degassing consumes less treatment time and purging gas volume.

Aim to assess ultrahigh fatigue life of impellers, fatigue tests up to 109 cycles were carried out by ultrasonic fatigue testing machine to research ultrahigh cycle fatigue (UHCF) behavior and mechanism of FV 520 B-I.

The fatigue cracks almost all initiated from the surface of an impeller when the fatigue life less than 107 cycles and then from the subsurface inclusion of an impeller when the fatigue life more than 107 cycles.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{application}} of micro-EDM to machine ceramic composites like Si 3 N 4 -TiN, Silicon infiltrated silicon carbide (SiSiC) and sintered SiC (SSiC) is investigated. These ceramic composites are difficult to be machined at microscale by conventional processing techniques. More specifically, the influence of process parameters on machining performances such as machining speed, tool wear and surface quality is studied in detail {{with the aid of}} the statistical Design of Experiment methods. Also, an in-depth analysis of the micro-EDM pulse generator is conducted to derive optimised machining strategies leading to maximum efficiency as well as to optimal machining accuracy. Each ceramic composite shows distinctive material removal mechanisms under variable machining conditions. Therefore, the correlation between material properties, machining results and input discharge pulse shapes has been investigated by extensive experiments. Furthermore, by exploring the process limits, it is experimentally proven that these ceramic composites can be shaped by micro-EDM process. Tool wear of the electrodes proves {{to be one of the}} critical factors affecting the dimensional and geometrical form accuracy of the micro-EDM milling process. The existing technology (e. g. the combination of in-process discharge detection and anticipating tool wear compensation) is able to accurately predict the tool wear for long prismatic tool electrodes. However, accurate tool wear compensation is not available in case of a change of workpiece geometry, tool dimension, tool path variation or extended machining time. In this work, the variables which are affecting the wear mechanisms are investigated and a more comprehensible model for tool wear is presented. Using this tool wear model, different milling conditions are evaluated by analysing the discharge pulses in order to further elevate the machining accuracy and production efficiency.
