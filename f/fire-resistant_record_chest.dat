40|$|We present 2 {{case reports}} to {{demonstrate}} the relationship between laryngeal muscle activity and respiration in children with bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) by simultaneous laryngeal electromyography (EMG) with <b>recording</b> of <b>chest</b> wall movement and intercostal muscle EMG. Laryngeal EMG was performed together with <b>recording</b> of <b>chest</b> wall movement in a 55 -day-old girl who was undergoing tracheostomy for idiopathic congenital BVFP. Normal phasic activity was observed, ie, the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle was active during expiration and the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle during inspiration, suggesting a good prognosis for recovery. The child was decannulated at 11 months. Laryngeal EMG together with <b>recording</b> of <b>chest</b> wall movement and intercostal EMG in a 5 year-old girl who was tracheostomy-dependent following tracheoesophageal fistula repair due to BVFP showed phasic activity during expiration for both the TA and PCA muscles, indicating aberrant regeneration of the PCA motor nerve. The timing of laryngeal muscle activity with respiration {{in the assessment of}} pediatric congenital BVFP is essential {{to demonstrate the}} presence of normal or abnormal medullary respiratory neuronal input to laryngeal motoneurons. In cases in which BVFP is due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, respiration-related laryngeal EMG will identify aberrant regeneration. Laryngeal EMG should be combined with intercostal muscle EMG in the evaluation of children with significant vocal fold dysfunction of either central or peripheral origin. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionLung cancer {{with breast}} {{metastasis}} is rare. However, differentiating between primary {{breast cancer and}} metastatic lung adenocarcinoma is of clinical importance. The metastasis cascade of how cancer cells migrate from the primary lung tumor to the breast is not clear yet. MethodsPathology and cytology databases were searched for patients diagnosed to have lung adenocarcinoma with breast metastasis. Their medical <b>records,</b> <b>chest</b> computed tomography images, and pathology slides were reviewed independently. ResultsWe identified six lung adenocarcinoma patients with breast metastases in a 10 -year period from a tertiary medical center. Interestingly, all breast metastases affected the same side as the primary lung cancers. In addition, all our cases shared other clinical manifestations, namely, ipsilateral pleural effusion/thickness and axillary lymph node enlargement. ConclusionBecause this distinctive feature could not be explained by simple coincidence, we consider that lung adenocarcinoma may preferentially metastasize to the ipsilateral breast through a stepwise mechanism, involving pleural seeding, axillary lymph node metastasis, and retrograde lymphatic spreading into the breast...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{survivability}} following infant {{cardiac arrest}} has {{been attributed to}} poor quality chest compressions. Current infant CPR manikins, used to teach and revise chest compression technique, appear to limit maximum compression depths (CDmax) to 40 mm.

A commercially available infant CPR manikin was instrumented to <b>record</b> <b>chest</b> compressions and modified to enable compression depths of 40 mm (original; CDmax 40) and 56 mm (the internal thoracic depth of a three-month-old male infant; CDmax 56). Forty certified European Paediatric Life Support instructors performed two-thumb (TT) and two-finger (TF) chest compressions at both CDmax settings in a randomised crossover sequence. Chest compression performance was compared to recommended targets and compression depths were compared to a proposed thoracic over-compression threshold.

40|$|Angina-like {{chest pain}} of non-cardiac origin {{is a major}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic problem. The oesophagus is frequently suspected to {{be the cause of}} the chest pain in these patients. However, a positive statement for the oesophageal origin of the pain can only be made when during manometry or pH-monitoring the familiar pain attack appears to be accompanied by reflux, severe motor disorders or a combination of both. Due to the intermittent nature of the pain this is only rarely the case during short-listing conventional examinations. Provocation tests have been used to induce the familiar chest pain. The Bernstein acid perfusion test and the edrophonium test yield the best results. Prolonged (24 -hour) ambulatory recording of intra-oesophageal pressure and pH to increase the chances of <b>recording</b> <b>chest</b> pain concomitantly with an episode of reflux and/or motor disorders appears to be the most sensitive and also the most physiological test. It is the only test that provides reliable information on the underlying mechanism of the pain, especially in patients with the syndrome of irritable oesophagus, thus contributing in establishing the appropriate therapy for these patients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{association}} of neurofibromatosis with diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD) has been described, but its true prevalence and characteristics remain unclear. The {{objective of the}} present study was to define diffuse lung disease in patients with neurofibromatosis. A retrospective case series and literature review in a tertiary care academic medical centre is reported in which medical <b>records,</b> <b>chest</b> radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were reviewed. A total of 55 adult patients with neurofibromatosis were identified, three of whom had NF-DLD. A literature review revealed 16 articles reporting 61 additional cases, yielding a total of 64 NF-DLD cases. The mean age of patients was 50 yrs. Males outnumbered females; most reported dyspnoea. Of the 16 subjects with documented smoking histories, 12 were ever-smokers. Eight patients had HRCT scan results demonstrating ground-glass opacities (37 %), bibasilar reticular opacities (50 %), bullae (50 %), cysts (25 %) and emphysema (25 %); none had honeycombing. A group of 14 patients had surgical biopsy results that showed findings of interstitial fibrosis (100 %) and interstitial inflammation (93 %). In conclusion, neurofibromatosis with diffuse lung disease is a definable clinical entity, characterised by upper lobe cystic and bullous disease and lower lobe fibrosis.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the functional outcome of a large number of patients after modifications of the Fontan operation and to investigate perioperative risk factors that might influence late functional state. Methods: A comprehensive cross-sectional review of the first 500 patients undergoing a Fontan operation at our institution was undertaken. Those surviving with an intact Fontan circulation were reviewed by questionnaire to assess functional status and medication history. Medical <b>records,</b> <b>chest</b> roentgenograms, echocardiograms, cardiac catheterizations, and laboratory investigations were also reviewed to assess postoperative status. Results: Three hundred sixty-three long-term survivors with an intact Fontan circulation were identified during cross-sectional follow-up. Median age at operation was 5. 0 years (range 0. 4 to 31 years), and median follow-up was 5. 4 years (range 1. 7 to 20 years). Most patients (91. 1 %) were in New York Heart Association class I or II. In a multivariate model, poor (class III or IV) functional state was associated with longer duration of follow-up (p < 0. 001), a prior atrial septectomy (p = 0. 03), and a prior main pulmonary artery-ascending aorta anastomosis (p = 0. 05). Conclusions: A poor functional outcome is uncommon after the Fontan operation but becomes more frequent with increasing duration of follow-up. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 114 : 392 - 403...|$|R

40|$|Purposeto {{determine}} {{the correlation of}} umbilical temperatures (Tumb) with simultaneously <b>recorded</b> <b>chest</b> wall temperature (Tchest) and rectal temperature (Trectal) in adults during rest, heat exposure and exercise. MethodsA total of 28 healthy men, wearing different types of clothing (athletic garb, a spandex full body heating garment, firefighter bunker gear) had average and peak umbilical, chest wall and rectal temperature measurements taken during sedentary temperature stabilisation stages, heat exposure periods and active exercise phases. ResultsCurvilinear relationships were noted between Tchest and Tumb compared with Trectal and their association became noticeably positive and linear at approximately 35. 5 0 C. Polynomial regression analysis of Trectal with linear and quadratic forms of Tchest and Tumb indicated an overall R 2 of 0. 657 and 0. 767, respectively. Bivariate analysis of a restricted data set (where Tchest and Tumb 2 ̆ 26535. 50), indicated that Tumb {{was significantly associated with}} Trectal (raverage = 0. 710, p < 0. 001; rpeak = 0. 841, p < 0. 001) and Tchest was also significantly associated with Trectal, but less so (raverage = 0. 570, p < 0. 001; rpeak = 0. 699, p < 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Conflicting {{data on the}} {{diagnostic}} and prognostic value of auscultation abnormalities may be partly explained by inconsistent use of terminology. OBJECTIVES: To describe general practitioners use of chest auscultation abnormality terms for patients presenting with acute cough across Europe, and to {{explore the influence of}} geographic location and case mix on use of these terms. METHODS: Clinicians recorded whether 'diminished vesicular breathing', 'wheezes', 'crackles' and 'rhonchi' were present in an observational study of adults with acute cough in 13 networks in 12 European countries. We describe the use of these terms overall and by network, and used multilevel logistic regression to explore variation by network, controlling for patients' gender, age, comorbidities, smoking status and symptoms. RESULTS: 2345 patients were included. Wheeze was the auscultation abnormality most frequently recorded (20. 6 % overall) with wide variation by network (range: 8. 3 - 30. 8 %). There was similar variation for other auscultation abnormalities. After controlling for patient characteristics, network {{was a significant predictor of}} auscultation abnormalities with odds ratios for location effects ranging from 0. 37 to 4. 46 for any recorded auscultation abnormality, and from 0. 25 to 3. 14 for rhonchi. CONCLUSION: There is important variation in <b>recording</b> <b>chest</b> auscultation abnormalities by general practitioners across Europe, which cannot be explained by differences in patient characteristics. There is a need and opportunity for standardization in the detection and classification of lung sounds...|$|R

Chest movement of four men who are experiencing three experiments was measured and recorded using this measurement tool. As a result, the following hypothesis was drawn from the relation of the task (situation) and breathing pattern which the subject's are performing. 1. Just before a deep breath is a time of being wide opened from a feeling of strain. 2. The amount of stress is related to amount of air which lung accumulated. 3. The satisfaction of correct answer is related to amount of air which lung accumulated. 4. When it is necessary to memorize, human will memorize after accumulation of air to lungs. 5. When human is stopping breathing, he is concentrating to something. 6. The level of experience can confirm by stability of breathing. From now on, in order to verify the above-mentioned hypothesis further, an experiment system is reconstructed, and research is advanced...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether there was an association between a failed test of cough reflex sensitivity and history of chest infection in a general population of rest home residents. One hundred rest home residents from four different levels of care (rest home, hospital, dementia and psycho-geriatric) were recruited and their cough reflex assessed using a solution of 0. 6 Mol/L citric acid nebulised and presented via a facemask. Participant’s records were then checked to see if there were any documented episodes of chest infection in the 6 month period prior to cough reflex testing. The results showed that out of 100 participants, 4 failed the cough reflex test. Of the 4 that failed the test, 3 had no documented episodes of <b>chest</b> infections <b>recorded</b> in the 6 month period prior to cough reflex testing. Data was not available for one participant who was deceased by the time of collection of the second data set. As such, there was no direct association demonstrated between a failed cough reflex test and development of chest infection or aspiration pneumonia. The results of the study are unexpected in two ways. Firstly, the relatively low number of participants who failed the cough reflex test is surprising as 72 % of the participants for whom a full data set was obtained had neurological conditions that are known predisposing factors for reduced cough reflex sensitivity. Secondly, the finding of no association between a failed cough reflex test and history of <b>recorded</b> <b>chest</b> infection is not consistent with other studies. There is however an established body of research that indicates the causes of aspiration pneumonia are multifactorial and not solely dependent upon aspiration.

40|$|Abstract Background Rural-to-urban {{migration}} in low- and middle-income countries causes {{an increase in}} individual cardiovascular risk. Cost-effective interventions at {{early stages of the}} natural history of coronary disease such as angina may stem an epidemic of premature coronary deaths in these countries. However, there are few data on the prevalence of angina in developing countries, whilst the understanding the aetiology of angina is complicated by the difficulty in measuring it across differing populations. Methods The PERU MIGRANT study was designed to investigate differences between rural-to-urban migrant and non-migrant groups in specific cardiovascular disease risk factors. Mass-migration seen in Peru from 1980 s onwards was largely driven by politically motivated violence resulting in less 'healthy migrant' selection bias. The Rose angina questionnaire was used to <b>record</b> <b>chest</b> pain, which was classified definite, possible and non-exertional. Mental health was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular disease risk factors and mental health) were used to assess the risk of chest pain in the migrant and urban groups compared to the rural group, and further to assess the relationship (age and sex-adjusted) between risk factors, mental health and chest pain. Results Compared to the urban group, rural dwellers had a greatly increased likelihood of possible/definite angina (multi-adjusted OR 2. 82 (1. 68 - 4. 73)). Urban and migrant groups had higher levels of risk factors (e. g. smoking - 20. 1 % urban, 5. 5 % rural). No diabetes was seen in the rural dwellers who complained of possible/definite angina. Rural dwellers had a higher prevalence of mood disorder and the presence of a mood disorder was associated with possible/definite angina in all three groups, but not consistently with non-exertional chest pain. Conclusion Rural groups had a higher prevalence of angina as measured by Rose questionnaire than migrants and urban dwellers, and a higher prevalence of mood disorder. The presence of a mood disorder was associated with angina. The Rose angina questionnaire may not be of relevance to rural populations in developing countries with a low pre-test probability of coronary disease and poor mental health. </p...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. The lung {{function}} test by a Plethysmograph enabled calculations {{to be made of}} the total lung capacity and vital capacity. A Motion Analysis System (Elite, BTS Inc., Milano Italy) was used to observe and <b>record</b> <b>chest</b> cage and spinal movements and as to correlate {{lung function}} with the chest cage and spine kinematics. Objectives. To determine the three- dimensional kinematics and the shape and size changes of the chest cage and thoracic spine motion during deep breathing in healthy and scoliotic individuals. Summary and Background Data. Lateral flexion plus rotation of the involved vertebrae around a vertical axis causing a decrease in lung function is the main disfigurement of scoliosis. Reports show that even after spinal fusion, reduced vital capacity associated with an increased residual volume are detected. Factors such as angle of scoliosis, length of the spinal column involved, and duration of the deformity influence pulmonary function but do not significantly affect its reduction. Mechanical inefficiency during breathing has not been studied. Methods. Three-dimensional kinematics of the chest cage and spine during breathing were studied in 41 scoliotic patients and in 20 healthy individuals. Three-dimensional chest cage motions relative to the spine and thoracic spine motions relative to T 12 were calculated. To examine stiffness of the spine, lateral bending angles were calculated. The {{lung function test}}, which including spirometry and lung subdivision, also was performed for the scoliotic patients. Results. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found in the movements of the upper level of the chest cage in anteroposterior and vertical directions, ranging from 16. 7 to 28. 6 mm in healthy individuals and from 12. 1 to 24. 2 mm in scoliotic patients. The thoracic spine displayed two-dimensional movements posteriorly and vertically during breathing, whereas less movement was seen in scoliotic patients. In addition, overall the scoliotic spine showed signs of stiffness in lateral bending. Conclusions. The range of movement of the chest cage and spine is more limited in the scoliotic cases. This overall stiffness of the chest cage and the spine may contribute to the mechanical inefficiency and impairment of pulmonary function found in scoliotic patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{pulmonary}} toxicity {{associated with}} gefitinib, an {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor inhibitor, has been reported recently, the accumulation of clinical information and the underlying mechanisms of gefitinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain insufficient and unclear. After retrospectively reviewing the clinical <b>records</b> and <b>chest</b> X-rays of 489 lung cancer patients who were treated with gefitinib, we diagnosed four cases of gefitinib-induced ILD who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We found that {{the period of time}} from starting gefitinib to the onset of ILD was short, and concluded that a careful and close observation of a chest imaging study and a collection of respiratory symptoms was recommended. All four patients were treated with a high dose of corticosteroids, and ILD was resolved. We detected high levels of interferon-inducible protein- 10 in BAL fluid, although we could not demonstrate the characteristic features of laboratory findings or BAL fluid cell analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Spectral {{characteristics}} of breath sounds in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) have not previously been compared, although the structural differences in these disorders might {{be reflected in}} breath sounds. METHODS [...] Flow standardised inspiratory breath sounds in patients with COPD (n = 17) and stable asthma (n = 10) with significant airways obstruction and in control patients without any respiratory disorders (n = 11) were compared in terms of estimates of the power spectrum. Breath sounds were recorded simultaneously at the chest and at the trachea. RESULTS [...] The median frequency (F 50) of the mean (SD) breath sound spectra <b>recorded</b> at the <b>chest</b> was higher in asthmatics (239 (19) Hz) than in both the control patients (206 (14) Hz) and the patients with COPD (201 (21) Hz). The total spectral power of breath sounds <b>recorded</b> at the <b>chest</b> in terms of root mean square (RMS) was higher in asthmatics than in patients with COPD. In patients with COPD the spectral parameters were not statistically different from those of control patients. The F 50 recorded at the trachea in the asthmatics was significantly related to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (r = - 0. 77), but this was not seen in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] The observed differences in frequency content of breath sounds in patients with asthma and COPD may reflect altered sound generation or transmission due to structural changes of the bronchi and the surrounding lung tissue in these diseases.

No differences were found in probability of death or medical separation by NTM species. Conclusions. M. gordonae, M. kansasii, and MAC were the commonest NTM among miners with suspected tuberculosis, with most MAC from smear-negative specimens in liquid culture only. HIV testing and identification of key pathogenic NTM in this setting are essential to ensure optimal treatment...|$|R
40|$|End-stage {{heart failure}} {{patients}} with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with/without cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) often require heart transplantation (HTPL) as a last-resort treatment. We aimed {{to assess the}} frequency and clinical impact of retained ICD lead materials in HTPL patients. In this retrospective single center study, we examined the clinical <b>records</b> and <b>chest</b> radiographs of patients with ICD and CRT-D who underwent HTPL between January 1992 and July 2014. Of 40 patients with ICD and CRT-D at HTPL, 19 (47. 5 %) patients had retained ICD lead materials within the central venous system. Retained ICD lead materials following HTPL were more frequently noted in patients with longer implantation durations until HTPL. None of the patients underwent extraction procedures after HTPL. All patients were asymptomatic and did not exhibit significant complications or death related to the retained ICD lead materials. Seven (7 / 40, 17. 5 %) patients without any retained ICD lead materials underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the follow-up period (median, 29. 5 months); none of the patients with retained lead materials were given MRI. Considering the common use of MRI in HTPL patients, further studies on the prophylactic extraction of retained ICD lead materials and safety of MRI in these patients are needed...|$|R
40|$|Itraconazole {{effectively}} controls active paracoccidioidomycosis but {{appears not}} to hinder lung fibrosis. Clinical <b>records</b> and <b>chest</b> radiographs from 47 itraconazole-treated patients with prolonged posttherapy follow-up (mean follow-up period, 5. 6 years) were analyzed; the radiographs were interpreted following pneumoconiosis standards that consider the lungs as 6 fields and grade damage according {{to the number of}} fields involved. Infiltrative lesions were observed at diagnosis in 93. 6 % of the patients. Fibrosis was observed in 31. 8 % of the patients at diagnosis and had not cleared {{at the end of the}} observation period in any of these patients. Fibrosis also developed de novo in 11 patients (25 %), so that by the end of the follow-up period it was seen in 53. 2 % of patients overall. Fibrosis correlated with severity of infiltrates at diagnosis: fibrosis was present in 83 % of patients with very severe infiltration and in 12. 5 % of patients with minor infiltration. Among patients with severe infiltration, fibrosis was present in 30 %; this increased (to 75 %) when bullae were concomitantly present at diagnosis. Prompt initiation of treatment is necessary to avoid the development of fibrosis. Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is an important sys-temic mycosis in Latin America, especially in Brazil; in Colombia, the disease is also regularly diagnosed. The disorder is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungu...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between oesophageal motility, luminal pH, and spontaneous pain events in 47 patients with recurrent angina like pain and {{normal coronary arteries}} was investigated. Preliminary investigation by conventional station pull through manometry (SPTM), {{was followed by a}} 24 hour period of ambulatory oesophageal motility and luminal pH monitoring. Computerised analysis of motility and pH data <b>recorded</b> during <b>chest</b> pain was then compared with pre-elected control samples taken before and after symptoms. Concurrent real time electrocardiographic (ECG) -ST segment analysis was performed to catalogue any ECG-STT wave changes indicative of myocardial ischaemia. SPTM showed a high group percentage incidence of simultaneous contractions (mean (SD) 11. 1 (2. 3) %) and a raised lower oesophageal sphincter tone (57. 4 (15. 2) mm Hg). During ambulatory monitoring, 35 patients experienced one or more episode of angina, providing a total of 59 pain events, although no significant change in group motility and reflux parameters peculiar to episodes of chest pain were found. Ischaemic ECG changes were detected in 10 (21 %) patients, but were accompanied by pain in only two. Independent analysis of the ECG traces corresponding to these purported ischaemic ECG events determined them unequivocal in three patients and probable in a further two. No apparent correlation was noted, however, between these ECG events and corresponding patterns of motility or reflux...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To compare {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) quality between manual CPR and minia-turized chest compressor (MCC) CPR. To improve CPR quality through evaluating the qual-ity of our clinical work of resuscitation by real-time video recording system. Methods The {{study was a}} retrospective observational study of adult patients who experienced CPR at the emergency department of Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital from March 2013 to August 2014. All the performance of CPR were checked back by the record of “digital real-time video <b>recording</b> system”. Average <b>chest</b> compression rate, actual chest compression rate, the percentage of hands-off period, time lag from patient arrival to chest compression, time lag from patient arrival to manual ventilation, time lag from patient arrival to first IV establish were compared. Causes of chest compression hands-off time were also studied. Results 112 cases of resuscitation attempts were obtained. Average chest compression rate wa...|$|R
