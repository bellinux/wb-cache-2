40|$|With an {{increasing}} international trade, a {{more and more}} significant expansion was experienced by combined commercial operations, also including goods processing transactions. The expansion of these international economic affairs had as motivation the multiple direct and indirect positive effects they produce both at micro and macro level, such as: obtaining a significant commercial profit and on this basis, increasing the currency contribution, increasing the general indicator of the international trade volume, relieving the balance of external payments of certain payments in currency, making optimum use of production capacity and labour force etc. Given {{the complexity of the}} combined commercial operations of foreign trade, in this article we shall address the commercial transactions of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods in terms of accounting models specific for conducting these transactions. In this regard, after the theoretical delimitation of these operations we shall emphasize the benefits of <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> of foreign goods but also without forgetting the limitations of these international commercial operations.

There is no clear evidence that Turkish exporters use the regime in order to avoid customs taxes and trade remedies. By reducing the cost of imported inputs with world prices and providing them in a timely manner, the regime places Turkish exporters on an equal footing with others in third countries. In addition, thanks to this regime Turkish businesses, in order to sell good quality products to the world, can reach raw materials, semi-manufactured products or high technology equipment that cannot be provided from the domestic market and that are necessary for an ambitious manufacturing process.

With the development of related research and its practical application, the intelligent scheduling method to solve the actual production problem will continue to make progress. Advanced manufacturing systems often use modern industrial-robot computer control for each station asked to handle materials.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fragmentation and}} globalisation {{in the context}} of the electronics industry in Ireland. Fragmentation refers to the breaking-up of vertically integrated production processes into various components. We find empirical evidence of fragmentation in a number of data sources. Data on <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> trade indicate that production in the Irish electronics industry is globally fragmented, and that the scale of such fragmented production is growing. Furthermore, Ireland’s share of fragmentation is rising faster than that in the EU generally, especially in the electronics industry. Other firm survey data show that the scale of local fragmentation has risen relative to global fragmentation as firms in different Irish intermediate goods producing sectors trade increasingly on the local Irish market. Looking more specifically at the computer manufacturing sector, we find evidence of fragmented production in this sector in that the ratio of bought-in materials to total sales has risen significantly over the past decade.

3000|$|The arrival by sea of unauthorised, undocumented {{people has}} been {{increasingly}} {{described as a}} matter of national security, in which the rights of the nation state are being encroached (Long, 2009). While governmental powers move to prohibit irregular migration, decisions of the highest courts in Australia and Europe have indicated an attempt to limit such executive power by invoking the relevance of international law (Hyndman & Mountz, 2008; Mitsilegas, 2015 b). Therefore, as states introduce more legislation to criminalise irregular migration and build legislative walls to limit judicial intervention (Pickering, 2005; Kneebone, 2009; Ng, 2012), we argue that the judicial function in adjudicating on these matters is, paradoxically, reinforced. Even if the executive has attempted to minimise the importance of the courts in matters of national sovereignty (Giannacopoulos et al., 2013), courts continue to {{play a significant role in}} this realm.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s the European apparel sector has {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of `postcommunist' Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence {{of these changes}} is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East - Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990 s these processes were driven by outward <b>processing</b> trade <b>arrangements</b> between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey. Further liberalization of trade regimes during the 1990 s removed these outward <b>processing</b> customs <b>arrangements,</b> but outward-processing forms of assembly production continue. The authors chart these transformations, and signal {{one part of the}} emerging architecture of trade relations between the EU and ECE after 1989. They explore the trade regulation changes that have provided a context for outsourcing and examine the different strategies of EU retailers and manufacturers in the governance of pan-European apparel production and trade. ...|$|R

40|$|It was {{the overall}} {{aim of this}} paper to {{highlight}} some {{of the implications of}} international production networks (or international fragmentation of production) on the relevance of comparative advantages, on some of their measures, on the determinants of economic activity. First, we emphasised that vertical, international disintegration of production processes necessarily blurs the concepts of comparative advantage as we know it and leads to a lessening of its power in explaining both merchandise composition and directions of trade; on the other hand, the concept of absolute advantage becomes increasingly relevant, as trade in intermediates grows at the world level. The basic reason for this result is that with trade in intermediates the factor content of traded final goods is no longer solely determined by autarkic relative factor endowments (in the Heckscher-Ohlin class of models), nor by autarkic relative productivities (as in the Ricardian class of models). Second, we have shown that with international fragmentation of production traditional measures of revealed comparative advantages may be misleading. These measures are still useful under the condition that the overall trade flows are properly disaggregated by reason of exchange. Data on trade in intermediates are useful in that they can offer a measure of the degree of production integration of any given domestic industry within the international production network: the upshot is that integration should no longer be thought of as simple trade integration, as we are accustomed to think of it. Third, we moved on to estimate a simple model of aggregate demand accounting for international trade in intermediates: our estimates show that the participationto this form of international division of labour can significantly affect the level of economic activity of a country above and beyond effects due to more traditional forms of international economic integration. More precisely, <b>inward</b> <b>processing</b> traffic appears to be a powerful contribution to GDP growth in ways other than those followed by ‘traditional’ exports of final goods. Thus our results show that international fragmentation of production changes the way we should look at international trade patterns irreversibly...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation, or PEO, is {{a surface}} modification {{process for the}} production of ceramic oxide coatings upon substrates of metals such as aluminium, magnesium and titanium. Two methodologies for the quantitative study of electrical breakdown (discharge) events observed during plasma electrolytic oxidation processes were developed and are described in this work. One method presented involves direct measurement of electrical breakdowns during production of an oxide coating within an industrial scale PEO <b>processing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The second methodology involves the generation and measurement of electrical breakdown events through coatings pre-deposited using full scale PEO processing equipment. The power supply used in the second technique is generally of much lower power output than the system used to initially generate the sample coatings. The application of these techniques was demonstrated with regard to PEO coating generation on aluminium substrates. Measurements of the probability distributions of discharge event characteristics are presented for the discharge initiation voltage; discharge peak current; event total duration; peak instantaneous power; charge transferred by the event and the energy dissipated by the discharge. Discharge events are shown to increase in scale with the voltage applied during the breakdown, and correlations between discharge characteristics such as peak discharge current and event duration are also detailed. Evidence was obtained which indicated a probabilistic dependence of the voltage required to initiate discharge events. Through the scaling behaviour observed for the discharge events, correspondence between the two measurement techniques is demonstrated. The complementary nature of the datasets obtainable from different techniques for measurement of PEO discharge event electrical characteristics is discussed with regards to the effects of interactions between concurrently active discharge events during large scale PEO processing.

The paper gives a detailed description of the existing payment system in the Philippines and discusses innovations in payments media, especially noncash payment instruments, and facilities for the clearing and settlement of payments. Areas for improving the efficiency and reducing risks in existing payment system have been identified. Developments in the payment system have implications for the conduct of monetary policy. The second to the last section of this paper, therefore, deals with this issue.
