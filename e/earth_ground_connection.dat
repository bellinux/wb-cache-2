50|$|Counterpoises are {{typically}} used in antenna systems for radio transmitters where a good <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> cannot be constructed.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{three-phase}} power plugs have an <b>earth</b> (<b>ground)</b> <b>connection,</b> {{but may not}} have a neutral because three-phase loads such as motors do not need the neutral. Such plugs have only four prongs (earth, and the three phases). An example of a socket with neutral is the L21-30 (30 A) and the L21-20 (20 A) both of which have five pins (earth, neutral, and X, Y, Z phases).|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a protective <b>earth</b> (<b>ground)</b> <b>connection.</b> A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage. For a transformer, this can mean that the primary and secondary windings must be separated by an extra insulation barrier, or by a conductive shield with a protective earth connection.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom {{requires}} {{the use of}} wire covered with green/yellow striped insulation, for safety <b>earthing</b> (<b>grounding)</b> <b>connections.</b> This growing international standard was adopted for its distinctive appearance, to reduce the likelihood of dangerous confusion of safety <b>earthing</b> (<b>grounding)</b> wires with other electrical functions, especially by persons affected by red-green colour blindness.|$|R

50|$|Wrist straps {{designed}} for industrial use usually connect to <b>earth</b> bonding points, <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> {{built into the}} workplace, via either a standard 4 mm plug or 10 mm press stud, whereas straps {{designed for}} consumer use often have a crocodile clip for the <b>ground</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{electronics}} and radio communication a counterpoise is {{a network of}} suspended wires or cables (or a metal screen), used {{as a substitute for}} an <b>earth</b> (<b>ground)</b> <b>connection</b> in a radio antenna system. It is used with radio transmitters or receivers when a normal earth ground cannot be used because of high soil resistance or when an antenna is mounted above ground level, for example, on a building. It usually consists of a single wire or network of horizontal wires, parallel to the ground, suspended above the ground under the antenna, connected to the receiver or transmitter's [...] "ground" [...] wire. The counterpoise functions as one plate of a large capacitor, with the conductive layers of the earth acting as the other plate.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{transmitting}} antenna, the quarter wave monopole, is physically large at these frequencies (25 to 250 m requiring a tall radio mast. Usually the metal mast itself {{is used as}} the antenna, and is mounted on a large porcelain insulator to isolate it from the ground; {{this is called a}} mast radiator. The monopole antenna, particularly if electrically short requires a good, low resistance <b>Earth</b> <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> for efficiency, since the ground resistance is in series with the antenna and consumes transmitter power. Commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many heavy copper cables, buried a few feet in the earth, radiating {{from the base of the}} antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength. In areas of rocky or sandy soil where the ground conductivity is poor, above ground counterpoises are used.|$|E
5000|$|Multi-standard sockets are {{sometimes}} used in China {{and some other}} Asian countries; these are intended to accommodate plugs conforming to various different standards. They do not normally have <b>earthing</b> (<b>grounding)</b> <b>connections</b> for either CEE 7/4 [...] "Schuko", or CEE 7/5 (French), or their combination CEE 7/7. In multi-standard sockets, the aperture size for NEMA plugs is often the same for both Line (Hot) and Neutral, which allows a polarized plug to be inserted in either orientation, thus defeating the safety feature. Also, in a socket designed to accept both NEMA and BS 1363 plugs, the polarization can only be correct for one type of plug, so only appliances which do not require specific polarization should be connected. Multi-standard sockets made by Lengon are amongst those classified as serious safety risks, because they allow the user to {{come into contact with}} live parts.|$|R
50|$|Combined {{neutral and}} ground {{conductors}} {{are commonly used}} in electricity supply companies' wiring and occasionally for fixed wiring in buildings and for some specialist applications where there is little alternative, such as railways and trams. Since normal circuit currents in the neutral conductor can lead to objectionable or dangerous differences between local earth potential and the neutral, and to protect against neutral breakages, special precautions such as frequent rodding down to <b>earth</b> (multiple <b>ground</b> rod <b>connections),</b> use of cables where the combined neutral and earth completely surrounds the phase conductor(s), and thicker than normal equipotential bonding must be considered to ensure the system is safe.|$|R
50|$|For {{polyphase}} systems, multiple single-phase transformers can be used, or {{all phases}} can {{be connected to}} a single polyphase transformer. For a three phase transformer, the three primary windings are connected together and the three secondary windings are connected together. Examples of connections are wye-delta, delta-wye, delta-delta and wye-wye. A vector group indicates {{the configuration of the}} windings and the phase angle difference between them. If a winding is connected to <b>earth</b> (<b>grounded),</b> the <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> point is usually the center point of a wye winding. If the secondary is a delta winding, the ground may be connected to a center tap on one winding (high leg delta) or one phase may be grounded (corner grounded delta). A special purpose polyphase transformer is the zigzag transformer. There are many possible configurations that may involve more or fewer than six windings and various tap connections.|$|R
50|$|Class 1 {{insulation}} {{requires that}} the metal body and other exposed metal parts of the device be connected to <b>earth</b> via a <b>grounding</b> wire that is earthed at the main service panelâ€”but only needs basic insulation on the conductors. This equipment needs an extra pin on the power plug for the <b>grounding</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Many {{hand-held}} and bench oscilloscopes {{have the}} ground reference voltage {{common to all}} input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the [...] "earth". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user will break the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope {{in an attempt to}} isolate the signal common from the <b>earth</b> <b>ground.</b> This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet will be connected into the circuit.

50|$|Monopole antennas used at low frequencies, such as {{the mast}} {{radiator}} antennas used for AM broadcasting, require the radio transmitter to be electrically connected to the Earth under the antenna; {{this is called a}} <b>ground</b> (or <b>earth).</b> The <b>ground</b> must have a low electrical resistance, because any resistance in the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> will dissipate power from the transmitter. Low-resistance grounds for radio transmitters are normally constructed of a network of cables buried in the earth. However, in areas with dry, sandy or rocky soil the ground has a high resistance, so a low-resistance <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> cannot be made. In these cases, a counterpoise is used. Another circumstance in which a counterpoise is used is when earth for a buried ground under the antenna mast is not available, such as in antennas located in a city or on top of a tall building.|$|R
40|$|In the paper, five {{global and}} {{synthetic}} sizes are {{proposed for the}} <b>earth</b> <b>grounding,</b> predestined to represent distinguishing criteria and to justify the chosen solution: the footprint area, the dispersion surface, the metal part mass and the <b>earth</b> <b>grounding</b> volume have technical character, while the investment cost has an economic nature.

50|$|A <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> that {{is missing}} or of {{inadequate}} capacity may {{not provide the}} protective functions as intended during a fault in the connected equipment. Extra <b>connections</b> between <b>ground</b> and circuit neutral may result in circulating current in the ground path, stray current introduced in the earth or in a structure, and stray voltage. Extra <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> on a neutral conductor may bypass the protection provided by a ground-fault circuit interrupter. Signal circuits that rely on a <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> will not function or will have erratic function if the <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> is missing.|$|R
50|$|Its main {{downside}} is that an insulated <b>grounding</b> <b>connection</b> has higher impedance than a non-isolated <b>grounding</b> <b>connection,</b> and no redundancy, so safety is reduced. Isolated ground receptacles are not allowed in patient care areas.|$|R
5000|$|If {{used for}} transmitting, a random wire antenna usually will also require an antenna tuner, {{as it has}} an {{unpredictable}} impedance that varies with frequency. One side of {{the output of the}} tuner is connected directly to the antenna, without a transmission line, the other to a good <b>earth</b> <b>ground.</b> A quarter-wavelength sized wire works best, and unless fed through a unun, a half-wavelength will exceed the matching ability of most tuners. [...] Even without a good earth, the antenna will also radiate, but it will do so by coupling capacitively to any nearby conducting material; nevertheless this is not recommended. The ground for a random wire antenna may be chosen by experimentation. Grounds could be returned to a nearby cold water pipe or a wire approximately one-quarter wavelength long, or can be replaced by randomly laid-out quarter-wavelength counterpoise wires attached to the <b>ground</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
40|$|Body {{area network}} (BAN) research, which uses {{the human body}} as a {{transmission}} channel, has recently attracted considerable attention globally. Zimmerman first advocated the idea in 1995. Illustrations of the electric field streamlines around {{the human body and}} wearable devices with electrodes were drawn. In the pictures, the electrodes of the wearable devices constitute a closed circuit with the human body and the <b>earth</b> <b>ground.</b> However, analysis of the circuit has not been conducted. In this study, we model the human body shunted to <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> in a radio anechoic chamber to analyze the electric field strength around it and clarify the effect of <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> during BAN run time. The results suggest that <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> has little influence on the human body and wearable devices. Only when the human body is directly grounded, the electric field near the feet area will decrease. The input impedance of the transmitter is approximately the same, and the received open-circuit voltage and current of the receiver are also the same. In addition, we elucidate that stable communications can be established by developing a closed circuit using <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> as return path.

25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rÏ€. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> G2 must be connected and also <b>ground</b> <b>connection</b> GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side â€“ a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the <b>ground</b> <b>connections</b> as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|R
