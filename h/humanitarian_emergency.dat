25|$|The Ebola {{outbreak}}, {{which was}} the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in Guinea in March 2014. The WHO warned {{that the number of}} Ebola patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months. The outbreak was accelerating. Medecins sans Frontieres has just opened a new Ebola hospital in Monrovia, and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both {{in terms of the number}} of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency</b> and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response. Brice de la Vinge, MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.|$|E

2500|$|He {{returned}} to Burundi, began purging his government, and arrested {{several of the}} coup leaders. Following the attempted coup, protests however continued and over 100,000 people had fled the country by 20 May causing a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency.</b> There are reports of continued and widespread abuses of human rights, including unlawful killings, torture, disappearances, and restrictions on freedom of expression.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} report {{the conditions of}} a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency</b> {{to the rest of}} the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each field mission. The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres. Various types of mortality rates are used to report the seriousness of a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency,</b> and a common method used to measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly monitoring the number of burials at cemeteries. By compiling data on the frequency of diseases in hospitals, MSF can track the occurrence and location of epidemic increases (or [...] "seasons") and stockpile vaccines and other drugs. For example, the [...] "Meningitis Belt" [...] (sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis in the world) has been [...] "mapped" [...] and the meningitis season occurs between December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of the season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years.|$|E
50|$|Tents {{are often}} used in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies,</b> such as war, {{earthquakes}} and fire. The primary choice of tents in <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> are canvas tents, because a cotton canvas tent allows functional breathability while serving the purpose of temporary shelter. Tents distributed by organisations such as UNHCR are made by various manufacturers, depending on the region where the tents are deployed, as well as depending on the purpose.|$|R
40|$|Many {{areas of}} the globe today face {{continuous}} armed conflict, {{with more and more}} populations caught in the crossfire. This has been true in both Afghanistan and Burundi where populations have to cope with the psychological and social effects of ongoing collective violence. While living and working in these countries, the author conducted research on the impact of these complex <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, and on ways to mitigate these impacts. His findings as published in this PhD thesis are based on the following questions: 1. How do people living in complex <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> conceptualise problems of mental health and wellbeing, and seek help for these issues? 2. How can mental health problems within complex <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> be adequately measured? 3. How can functional systems able to address mental health and psychosocial problems within complex <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> be developed? Answering these central questions requires the use {{of a wide range of}} research techniques and draws from various academic disciplines, such as cultural anthropology, mental health epidemiology and health systems research. The twelve chapters of this book all delve into specific aspects related to these central questions. Taken together, this kaleidoscopic range of topics and perspectives provide the reader with invaluable insights into the emerging field of global mental health within complex <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{insurgency}} was historically {{confined to}} the region known as Acholiland, consisting of the districts of Kitgum, Gulu, and Pader, though since 2002 violence has overflowed into other Ugandan districts. The LRA also operated across the porous border region with Southern Sudan and most recently into the northeastern Ituri Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plight of the affected people has received little media coverage in the developed world. Not until April 2004 did the UN Security Council issue a formal condemnation. A 2005 poll of humanitarian professionals, media personalities, academics and activists identified {{the conflict in the}} north of Uganda as the second worst [...] "forgotten" [...] <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency</b> in the world, after the conflicts of the neighbouring DRC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} {{media coverage of}} the plight of the refugees eventually led U.S. President Bill Clinton to call it the [...] "world’s worst humanitarian crisis in a generation" [...] and large amounts of relief was mobilized. Attention quickly focused on the refugees around Goma. Over 200 aid organizations rushed into Goma to start an emergency relief operation comparable to that seen in the Yugoslav wars. Until December, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received over $1 million monthly. The resources dedicated to the refugees led to a rapid drop in the mortality rate in late 1994. The American military formed an emergency logistical operation, based out of Entebbe International Airport in Uganda, to ferry supplies and relief personnel to the crisis regions. While several humanitarian organizations expressed concern about mixing the military in humanitarian operations, it quickly became clear that only the military could create large centralized logistical support with the speed and scale needed to alleviate a massive <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In mid-February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian {{refugees}} {{landed on}} the Italian island of Lampedusa, causing the authorities to declare {{a state of emergency}} that would allow for federal aid to the island. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni accused the EU of not doing enough to curb immigration and asked them to do more. He said that the [...] "Tunisian system was 'collapsing'" [...] and that he would [...] "ask the Tunisian Foreign Ministry for permission for our authorities to intervene to stop the flow in Tunisia," [...] suggesting Italian troops would be on Tunisian soil. He called the event a [...] "biblical exodus." [...] The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it [...] "categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty." [...] In response, Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that both countries share a [...] "common interest" [...] to halt the immigration, while he also offered [...] "logistical help in terms of police and equipment. Until now the system of patrolling the coasts of Northern Africa has worked and we want to re-establish the technique, which had reduced illegal immigration to zero until a month ago." [...] Tunisia then said that it had troops patrolling southern fishing ports and that checkpoints had been erected in coastal towns. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to Sicily with the other 2,000 quarantined at a re-opened holding centre. On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island. In response Italy declared a <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergency.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> {{result in}} a {{breakdown}} of critical health-care services and often make vulnerable communities dependent on external agencies for care. In resource-constrained settings, this may occur {{against a backdrop of}} extreme poverty, malnutrition, insecurity, low literacy and poor infrastructure. Under these circumstances, providing food, water and shelter and limiting communicable disease outbreaks become primary concerns. Where effective and safe vaccines are available to mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, their potential deployment is a key consideration in meeting emergency health needs. Ethical considerations are crucial when deciding on vaccine deployment. Allocation of vaccines in short supply, target groups, delivery strategies, surveillance and research during acute <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies</b> all involve ethical considerations that often arise from the tension between individual and common good. The authors lay out the ethical issues that policy-makers need to bear in mind when considering the deployment of mass vaccination during <b>humanitarian</b> <b>emergencies,</b> including beneficence (duty of care and the rule of rescue), non-maleficence, autonomy and consent, and distributive and procedural justice...|$|R
