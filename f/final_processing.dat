5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for <b>final</b> <b>processing,</b> known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for <b>final</b> <b>processing,</b> known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of the creameries, the local farmers wished to have greater control of their own dairy {{products}} and pricing. Rather than transport the cream to Brisbane for <b>final</b> <b>processing</b> where the vibration of the train journey could impact the quality, the farmers wished to churn butter in Boonah. There was also a strong desire to remove their reliance on privately owned factories and participate in the cooperative movement in the dairy industry that was gaining momentum in Queensland. To achieve this, a local butter factory operated as a cooperative venture was required.|$|E
25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the <b>final</b> <b>processing</b> stage to provide microbial stability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{process is}} called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass {{is kept in}} a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness {{and quality of the}} chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about [...] until <b>final</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E

The video was directed by Katya Tsaryk, a young but well-known Ukrainian director who also created the video for the 2008 Ukrainian entry [...] "Shady Lady" [...] for popular singer Ani Lorak, being choreographed by Fokas Evangelinos. The shooting took place in Athens, at two main locations. The first was at the STARZ club where Rouvas is performing along with the Maggira Sisters for the winter season, set in front of a huge screen and many flashing lights, while the second is at the King George suite hotel, where the morning shooting took place. The rest of the video was shot around the city life of Athens, some shot solely by the cameramen while other filming was taking place, and other scenes featuring Rouvas.

2500|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a set}} of complete dentures is a challenge for any dentist/denturist. [...] There are many axioms in the production of dentures that must be understood; ignorance of one axiom can lead to failure of the denture. [...] In the vast majority of cases, complete dentures should be comfortable soon after insertion, although almost always at least two adjustment visits are necessary to remove the cause of sore spots. [...] One of the most critical aspects of dentures is that the impression of the denture must be perfectly made and used with perfect technique to make an accurate model of the patient's edentulous (toothless) gums. [...] The dentist or denturist must use a process called border molding to ensure that the denture flanges are properly extended. [...] An array of problems may occur if the final impression of the denture is not made properly. It takes considerable patience and experience for a dentist to know how to make a denture, and for this reason it may be in the patient's best interest to seek a specialist, either a prosthodontist or denturist, to make the denture. A denturist is a trained and licensed professional who sees patients in need of dentures, partials, relines or repairs. A denturist not only takes the impression, but makes the entire denture {{in his or her own}} laboratory. The denturist then schedules a date for the delivery of the finished dentures to the patient. A general dentist may do a good job making dentures, but only if he or she is meticulous and experienced. Many dentists no longer make dentures themselves. but instead take an impression of the patients' mouth and then either send the impressions to a dental laboratory, which could be anywhere in the world, or send the patient to a denturist. Once the laboratory receives dental impressions of the patient's mouth, the laboratory creates plaster molds from them. [...] The laboratory uses the molds to create the wax rims used to register the patient's bite. [...] These wax rims are returned to the dentist, who uses them to register the patient's bite. [...] The dentist may assist the patient in choosing the correct size of teeth for the dentures, or simply make the selection himself. [...] Once bite registration is completed and the teeth are selected for the dentures, the wax rim is usually returned to the dental laboratory in order to have the denture teeth set into the wax. [...] Once the teeth are set into the wax rim, the result is a prefinished denture that looks almost like the finished product. This prefinished denture is usually returned to the dentist's office and the patient usually has a chance to approve the setup (for immediate or standard dentures) or to try the denture before it is finished. After approval by the patient, the dentist returns the pre-denture to the laboratory for <b>final</b> <b>processing.</b> The finished denture is then returned to the dentist's office for delivery to the patient.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the current status of the Croatian sawmilling industry and a future forecast. This overview is based on data available regarding the current status, including fragments (facts) and citations from various studies and papers that describe the scene of events in the near future. Croatia has a long traditionin wood processing. The tradition of wood processing in Croatia was founded on the first industry capacities - sawmills and sawmilling products. In the new millennium, many factors affected technology and changes in the Croatian sawmilling industry. The most significant changes were in the quality of logs, development of domestic and global (foreign) <b>final</b> wood <b>processing,</b> as well as the general development of machinery and equipment. Generally, wood industry sector in the Republic of Croatia is marked by a large number of small enterprises and {{a relatively small number of}} large manufacturers. The most evident problem is the large capacity of sawmill industry, which is still three times greater than the allowed annual cut in our forests. The bulk of sawmilling products, manufactured in our sawmills, are exported primarily to the countries of West Europe. Export is, therefore, a condition for survival of sawmill industry in a situation where there is a relatively low demand in the domestic market. However, the strategic policy of the State and wood sector is to change the export structure of wood products in favour of products of higher quality of <b>final</b> wood <b>processing...</b>|$|R
