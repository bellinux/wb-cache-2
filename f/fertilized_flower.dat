50|$|The Coprosma rotundifolia {{produces}} flowers between September and November. These imperfect {{flowers are}} in axillary clusters of 2-4 with {{male and female}} flowers. However, female and male flowers are produced on separate trees, this makes them dioecious. Male flowers do not have calyx (a group of floral leaves on {{the outer edge of}} a flower). The corolla (whorl of flower petals) is a funnel shape with the lobes widest at the base and ovate (round) with a sharp tip furthest from the tube. The female flowers have slightly more small short hairs with slightly toothed calyx. The corolla are tubular and are fused with two translucent stigma. The flower from the female is positioned in a cup-like structure called the calyculus that is formed from bracts. This flower has clear stigma that relies on wind pollination. Pollen is produced by the male flowers. The flowers predominantly cross pollinate via wind dispersal. Pollen then comes into contact with the ova (female part of the flower) to fertilse it. From this stage, if compatable, the <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower</b> will produce a drupe containing two fertile seeds within the flesh.The fruit is orange to red in colour and is produced from September to August. These are a globe shape dupe which are formed on short branches 4-5mm in diameter. The fruit contains two seeds within the flesh. These are predominantly dispersed by birds as the fruit is edible.The seeds will germinate in favourable conditions such as soils with higher levels of calcium carbonate. This once germinated will form a seedling which will grow into a juvenile shrub through to a mature large shrub to small tree.|$|E

The inbreds differed very significantly in their attentiveness to pollinating insects. Only one inbred exhibited a significant correlation (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 positive) between numbers of honey bees and seed yields. Separating the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects indicated that pollination attractiveness was not the limiting factor in seed set for inbreds in the experiment. Moreover, most of the variation in seed yield could be attributed to indirect effects on the components of yield, umbels per plant, flowers per umbel, percent per <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower,</b> and seeds per <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower...</b>|$|E
40|$|Allometry among root dry weight, shoot dry weight, leaf {{area and}} the number of flower {{clusters}} of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) sown in July and August was investigated for three varieties: two Japanese local varieties and a tetraploid one. Allometry was found between dry weight of main and lateral roots, total dry weight of roots and shoot dry weight, and between total root dry weight and leaf area. Each allometry gave a constant relative growth coefficient over varieties and seeding times. By contrast, though allometry was found between total root dry weight {{and the number of}} flower clusters, relative growth coefficients differed with varieties and seeding times. This suggests that the amount of mineral nutrients and water supplied to a flower cluster, which may influence yield through percentages of <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower</b> and ripened grain, differs with varieties and seeding time...|$|E
40|$|Variation of the {{characteristics}} of flower clusters was analyzed to obtain information on the relationship between source-sink relationship and yield in common buckwheat. The concept of module which is the smallest, repeated, units of development (Tuomi and Vuorisala 1989) was applied for the analysi s. The number of bloomed flower (N) per module and that of <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower</b> (F) per module were investigated in 3 fields. The relationship between Nand F in each plant was given by the equation, F = a + f 3 N, where a is an intercept and f 3 is a regression coefficient. As F and N are regarded as substantial and potential sink size, respectively, f 3 can be regarded as an indicator of sink activity. When the sign of a was negative, it shows that fertilization percentage is lower in a module on higher position which has smaller number of flowers, suggesting a decline in growth vigor in the latter period of reproductive growth. On the contrary, when the sign of a was positive, a rise in growth vigor in the latter period of reproductive growth is suggested. Therefore, a seemed to be a useful indicator of the pattern of source activity change with time. Variations of a and f 3 were large among plants, while those among fields were relatively small. In Togakushi field, f 3 ranged very widely from 0. 22 to 0. 65 among plants. Variations in a and f 3 were therefore suggested to be determined by genetic factors of each plant rather than environmental factors. Negative correlation between a and f 3 among plants was observed in all fields. Standard error of regression between N and F was considered to be an indication of the magnitude of the effect of environmental factors during reproductive growth period on fert ilization...|$|E

40|$|AbstractResponse of {{flowering}} and seed production to climatic changes was observed on sandalwood ex situ genetic conservation in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2005 to 2010 flowering periods. To observe flowering phenology, each of 10 individual of 7 provenances were marked and the flowering phenology parameters were observed daily during the flowering period. To measure productivity parameters (Pollination Effectiveness, PE and Reproductive Success, RS), each of 10 individuals of 7 provenances were marked, and the flowers, fertilized flowers and mature seed were then counted. PE {{was measured by}} dividing <b>Fertilized</b> <b>flower</b> toFlower. RS was measured following the formula: RS = (Fruit/Flower) x (Seed/Ovule). Fluctuation on rainfall and temperature were observed during 2005 to 2010 flowering periods. The reduction on yearly rainfall was observed during 2006 to 2007. The elevated temperature increment until 31, 060 C at the early of 2007 is the most extreme one. Prolonged rainy season recorded during 2008 to 2010 in which there were no dry monthoccured even in summer. Each of provenances still kept its flowering behavior similar to those expressed in their origin. Provenancesof the same origin with similar genotypes performed similar flowering characters. Flowering asynchrony and plasticity observed among provenances. The value of PE and RS observed to be provenances specific, as well as seed abortion that was occurred at various developmental phases. Both flowering and seed production were strongly controlled by both genetic andclimatic factors. Provenances with similar genotypes performed similar response to alteration of rainfall and temperature due to climate changes. Extreme temperature increment at early of 2007 led to shorter flowering period, higher flowering frequency, decrement of flower and fruit abundance, and higher seed abortion. In contrary, prolonged rainfall in 2010 affected to longer flowering period, later floral initiation, shorter stigma receptivity and pollen longevity, bigger size of reproductive organs and paler color of perigonium. Constantly, dry season always results to the highest production of flowers, pollinated flowers and mature fruits compared to those of rainy season...|$|E

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} were carried out. In the first experiment, 13 variables were studied for 3 inbred groups as influenced by genetic differences, source of pollen, soil moisture, fertilizers, {{and size of}} bulbs. Path-coefficient analysis was made of var ious insect pollinators influencing seed yield in different inbreds, and of components of seed production in all inbreds together. In the second experiment, 4 variables were studied for one male-sterile inbred and one male-fertile inbred as influenced by soil moisture and fertilizers. Genetic differences among inbreds {{were the most important}} source of variation in seed yields. This points out that a major portion of the onion seed problem could be solved through plant breeding. The inbreds differed very significantly in t heir attractiveness to pollinating insects, probably as a result of varying genetic vigor which influenced nectar formation. Most of the inbreds had negative correlation or no correlation between the number of honey bee nectar collectors and seed yield. The separation of correlation with honey bee nectar and pollen collectors into components of direct and indirect effects indicates that the number of pollinating insects was excessive for all inbreds in the experiment. Negative direct effects on seed yield and negative indirect effects through percent fertilized flowers and seeds per <b>fertilized</b> <b>flower</b> disclose some important aspects as possible causes for low onion seed yields: 1. Depletion of assimilated food needed for the development of fertilized ovules through an overdraw on nectar by nectar collectors. 2. Water deficit affecting fertilized developing ovules due to increased transpiration resulting from overhandling of flowers by honey bees, especially by pollen collectors, which through nervous search for pollen on male- sterile lines might cause enough physical damage to increase transpiration even at low visitation levels. At high visitation levels, pollen collectors might also harm male-fertile lines. 3. Removal of pollen from the stigmas of male-sterile flowers by high populations of pollen collecting honey bees. Compatibility of the pollen parents with the male-sterile inbreds was influenced by soil moisture levels. At high moisture, M 611 C increased seed yields while B 12115 - 2 C decreased them. At low moisture the reverse was true. In the first experiment there was no significant yield response to varying soil moisture levels due to contrasting effects of high soil moisture on compatibility with pollen parents. In the second experiment, the pollen parent B 2215 C was used and a significant favorable response to high soil moisture was obtained. Salinity aspects and the effects of indiscriminate use of fertilizers were tested through the method of fertilizer placement. While fertilizers reduced seed yield, high soil moisture tended to reduce the negative effects of nitrogen and to produce favorable response to phosphorus. Seed yield followed the trend in plant survival as affected by the induced salinity x moisture relationships. The size of bulbs had a great influence on seed yields, mainly through an increased number of umbels per plant. It seems that the number of umbels per plant had more influence on the number of flowers per row than did the number of flowers per umbel. Path-coefficient analysis of components of onion seed production indicates that the percentage of fertilized flowers is the most important criterion for selection to improve seed yield. It would be ideal to combine both high percentage of fertilized flowers and large number of flowers per umbel, but if compromise has to be made, selection would best be considered on the basis of greater percentage of fertilized flowers in the umbel. Plants which have a large percentage of fertilized flowers can be easily detected at the pre-seed harvest stage...|$|E
