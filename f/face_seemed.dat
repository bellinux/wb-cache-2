25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point {{high up on the}} Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged an avalanche of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{schedule}} allowed the funeral train {{to stop for}} no longer than 30 minutes, {{only a few thousand}} people passed through the funeral car. A band played dirges in [...] "mumbled tones" [...] and a three-year-old girl laid a bouquet on the coffin as her tribute of respect. The coffin lay on blocks [...] in height. Festoons of black cloth hung from the sides, [...] "bespangled with silver stars and edged in silver bullion." [...] The upper lid of the coffin was laid back so as to reveal the head and bust of the late President. Lincoln's <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to retain all the dignity and strength of life. [...] "The lines of his grave countenance were unchanged, and his eyes were those of one in peaceful slumber." ...|$|E
60|$|The Marquis' eyes glistened. His <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> more hawklike than ever.|$|E
60|$|The three {{looking into}} each other's <b>faces,</b> <b>seemed</b> to breathe more freely.|$|R
60|$|He was {{astonished}} at his fluency, because {{his mind was}} stammering and his hands twitching. Neither of them answered; but their <b>faces</b> <b>seemed</b> to him as if contemptuous.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most beautiful!" [...] said Nigel, gazing {{intently at}} the portrait. [...] "That dear child's <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> so {{familiar}} to me that I could almost fancy I had seen it." ...|$|R
60|$|Reggie {{considered}} the matter. His <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> drawn under the mental strain.|$|E
60|$|He {{was tall}} and thin and his <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> badly tanned or sunburnt.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to darken}} as {{she rose and}} moved towards the door.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Louvre, Study {{of right}} hand of Erasmus, with sketch of face. The hand {{relates to the}} London portrait; the <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> to be later, and related to the roundel of c. 1532 ...|$|R
60|$|John nodded. In {{the little}} passage where they stood, he and Stephen seemed to dwarf the passers-by. The men, in their evening clothes and pallid <b>faces,</b> <b>seemed</b> {{suddenly}} insignificant, {{and the women}} like dolls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your friend," [...] remarked Mr. Sabin, helping {{himself to}} an ortolan, [...] "is a journalist, is he not? His <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> {{familiar}} to me although I have forgotten his name, if ever I knew it." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{eyes were}} shining; his <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to glow. He smiled to her.|$|E
60|$|Barnes {{looked up}} at him anxiously. His pale <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> twisted into a scowl.|$|E
60|$|Major Vernon {{started a}} little at the name and his <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to redden.|$|E
60|$|That {{night the}} empty {{corridors}} Were full of forms of Fear, And {{up and down}} the iron town Stole feet we could not hear, And through the bars that hide the stars White <b>faces</b> <b>seemed</b> to peer.|$|R
6000|$|... "It are Jack Pearson," [...] {{the hunter}} said, [...] "but {{for the moment}} I can't {{recollect}} ye, though yer <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> known. Why!" [...] he exclaimed in changed tones, [...] "it's that boy Harold growed into a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely we {{have met}} before, Mr. Maddison," [...] the baronet said easily. [...] "Your <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> quite {{familiar}} to me. Ah! I remember now, it was near that place of Lord Lathon's, Mallory Grange, upon the coast. A terrible affair, that." ...|$|R
60|$|The Glasgow Daisy grinned again, {{until his}} <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> all {{freckles}} and flashing white teeth.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Juley {{shook her}} head; her <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> {{suddenly}} {{to have become}} one immense pout.|$|E
60|$|Barrington {{turned again}} to Winston, and his <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to have grown}} a trifle stern.|$|E
50|$|Aillas, now King of Troicinet, Dascinet and South Ulfland, {{and his son}} Dhrun, make a {{diplomatic}} visit to Lyonesse. Casmir is puzzled as to how Aillas, barely out of his teens, could have a nine-year-old son, and why Aillas' <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> rather familiar.|$|R
6000|$|That {{night the}} empty {{corridors}} [...] Were full of forms of Fear, [...] And {{up and down}} the iron town [...] Stole feet we could not hear, [...] And through the bars that hide the stars [...] White <b>faces</b> <b>seemed</b> to peer.|$|R
60|$|As he {{laid the}} girl down in the shallow hollow of the little ridge with her white face upturned, she opened her eyes. Wide, staring black, at once like both the night and the stars, they made her <b>face</b> <b>seem</b> still whiter.|$|R
60|$|She paused. The woman's <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to grow quizzical, {{though the}} pleasantness did not abate.|$|E
60|$|The warm, sunburn glow in Grief's <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to grow warmer. His {{hand went}} out.|$|E
60|$|The younger passenger, whose quiet, well-bred <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{indicate}} more discipline of character, smiled.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course there}} was an {{enthusiastic}} clapping when Miss Celia sat down, but even while hands applauded, consciences pricked, and undone tasks, complaining words and sour <b>faces</b> <b>seemed</b> to rise up reproachfully before many of the children, {{as well as their}} own faults of elocution.|$|R
50|$|Faces contain {{secondary}} sex {{characteristics that}} make {{male and female}} faces readily distinguishable, including {{the shape of the}} forehead, nose, lips, cheeks, chin, and jawline; the features in the upper third of the <b>face</b> <b>seem</b> to be the most important, but subtle changes in the lips can have a strong effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, Twentyman," [...] {{an officer}} of the 91st said as he was {{standing}} beside him when Ronald rode up and delivered a message, [...] "that fellow of yours is wonderfully well mounted. He's a fine soldierly-looking fellow, too, and I don't know why, but his <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> quite familiar to me." ...|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{became very}} grave. His <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to grow longer {{as he pulled}} his goatee.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} her aunt's <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> {{wonderful}} to Nedda; so quiet, yet so burningly alive.|$|E
60|$|Guidobaldo's <b>face</b> <b>seemed</b> to change, and {{his eyes}} looked curiously at the white-faced Duke beside him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who is the smartly dressed, sunburnt little Johnny who {{is staring}} at you so, Miss Bultiwell?" [...] asked her vis-à-vis at a luncheon party at the Savoy one day. [...] "His <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> {{familiar}} to me, but I can't place him. I'm sure I've been told something interesting about him, somewhere or other." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} dark, gentle eyes to my <b>face</b> and <b>seemed</b> surprised.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} demon sitting atop a mountain. His flexed musculature and wrought hands contrast vividly with his slumped figure and sad facial expression. He appears at once passive, introverted, proud and solitary. His body shows contrasting masculinity and femininity {{with his long}} hair and indolent gaze. His <b>face</b> <b>seems</b> desperate for love in his cold surroundings.|$|R
