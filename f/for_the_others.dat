This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell invited {{boys from}} {{different}} social backgrounds to the camp, a revolutionary idea during the class-conscious Edwardian era. Eleven {{came from the}} well-to-do private boarding schools of Eton and Harrow, mostly sons of Baden-Powell's friends. Seven came from the Boys' Brigade at Bournemouth, and three came from the Brigade at Poole & Hamworthy. Baden-Powell's nine-year-old nephew Donald Baden-Powell also attended. The camp fee was dependent on means: one pound for the public school boys, and three shillings and sixpence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions {{of property and}} family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated that it was upon the first son that family expectations fell; the family would strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{guns were}} placed into storage in Bizerte. In January 1940 France {{gave them to}} Finland, after refusing to sell seven to the Finns {{in the summer of}} 1939. Of the twelve main guns, eight made it to Finland, while four were seized by Germany when it invaded Norway in April 1940 and {{captured}} them on board SS Nina in Narvik harbor. The Germans emplaced all four guns, after rebuilding them to accept German ammunition, in armoured turrets in Batterie Mirus on Guernsey. The Finns used four guns in coastal artillery positions at Isosaari and Mäkiluoto. Two other guns were used to repair Soviet TM-3-12 railway guns abandoned at Hanko when the Soviets evacuated in 1941. After the war these handed over to the Soviet Union, where they were kept operational until the 1990s. The remaining two guns were kept as spares <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> one of which was used to replace one gun damaged during tests with 'super charges' in the 1970s. One gun turret is now a memorial at Isosaari while the remaining spare barrel is preserved at the Finnish Coast Artillery Museum at Kuivasaari.|$|E

25|$|The German {{settlers}} came {{primarily from}} Russia, and after 1914 from German-American settlements in North and South Dakota. They came not as large groups but {{as part of}} a chain of family members, where the first immigrants would find suitable locations and send <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> They formed compact German-speaking communities built around their Catholic or Lutheran churches, and continuing old-world customs. They were farmers who grew wheat. Arrivals from Russia, Bukovina, and Romanian Dobruja established their villages in a 40-mile-wide tract east of Regina.|$|E
25|$|The Hopkins {{family were}} members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). In 1807 they emancipated their slaves in {{accordance}} with their local Society decree, which called for freeing the able-bodied and caring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> who would remain at the plantation and provide labor as they could. The second eldest of eleven children, 12-year-old Johns was required to work on the farm, interrupting his formal education. From 1806 to 1809, he likely attended The Free School of Anne Arundel County, which was located in today's Davidsonville, Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Depending on the source, {{the vessels}} of the Pawtuxet class were each powered by either one double- or two single-cylinder {{oscillating}} engines; {{the distinction is}} probably semantic. The engine (or engines) operated a single 8-foot diameter screw propeller. The only available machinery specifications are for the cutter Kankakee, but specifications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were probably similar if not identical. The oscillating cylinders for Kankakee had a 36 inch bore, 30-inch stroke and 10-inch steam cut-off. Steam, at a pressure of about 22 psi, was supplied by a single tubular boiler. The engine drove a single 8-foot diameter, 12-foot pitch screw propeller geared upward {{at a ratio of}} 3:1, delivering a speed of about 12 knots.|$|E
