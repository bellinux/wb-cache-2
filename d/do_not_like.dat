5|$|Turunen's {{voice is}} {{described}} by critics as remarkably powerful and emotional. Sometimes it is stated that her voice is too trained or operatic for metal music, but even critics who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> classical voices admit that her voice suits the kind of metal songs she sings unusually well.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of whom <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff are}} {{preparing}} to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers {{that he will be}} sitting in the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.|$|E

25|$|Jianbing can satisfy {{different}} people’s tastes {{as it can}} be {{made with}} many different ingredients and mixed with different sauces, jams and flavors in different proportions.

25|$|Tiny and Lou are two Asian elephants. Of all {{the animals}} Tiny and Lou are the most immature. Tiny is blue and has a high-pitched voice as Lou is yellow and has a {{low-pitched}} voice.

25|$|Lack of {{behavior}} change: Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. In some cases, these toilets {{are provided by}} the government or other organizations and the people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they are hesitant to change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley), a pretty-boy scam {{artist to}} whom Marcy wakes {{up one morning}} and discovers she is married. Unlike Steve, Jefferson is an unemployed, lazy dimwit who takes {{advantage}} of Marcy. When he gets caught, he distracts her by working his pretty-boy charm and resorting to sexual bartering. Steve and Jefferson <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> each other for personal reasons. In several episodes, Jefferson is implied to have had a past life as a former spy/CIA operative.|$|E
25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be petted. In fact, {{touching a}} goldfish can endanger its health, {{because it can}} cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.|$|E

25|$|Other {{examples}} include jumping {{in front of}} cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> using verbal claims, most people have dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, a {{new type}} of strings were {{produced}} made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western catgut strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings are able to be turned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate unlike silk. The strings have various names in China but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s when silk string production stopped.|$|E
25|$|Some users <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the {{overlapping}} privacy policy, wishing {{to keep the}} service of Google separate. The update to Google’s privacy policy has alarmed {{both public and private}} sectors. The European Union has asked Google to delay the onset of the new privacy policy {{in order to ensure that}} it does not violate E.U. law. This move is in accordance with objections to decreasing online privacy raised in other foreign nations where surveillance is more heavily scrutinized. Canada and Germany have both held investigations into the legality of both Facebook, against respective privacy acts, in 2010. The new privacy policy only heightens unresolved concerns regarding user privacy.|$|E

6000|$|Again, this is {{defective}} observation. It {{is human}} {{to like to}} be praised; one can even notice it in the French. But it is <b>not</b> human to <b>like</b> to be ridiculed, even when it {{comes in the form}} of a [...] "tribute." [...] I think a little psychologizing ought to have come in there. Something like this: A dog <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be ridiculed, a redskin <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be ridiculed, a negro <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be ridiculed, a Chinaman <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> to be ridiculed; let us deduce from these significant facts this formula: the American's grade being higher than these, and the chain-of argument stretching unbroken all the way up to him, there is room for suspicion that the person who said the American likes to be ridiculed, and regards it as a tribute, is not a capable observer.|$|R
