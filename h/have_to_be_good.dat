Slayer members {{wanted to keep the}} use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of delay and distortion. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer Paul Bostaph follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: [...] "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did." [...] Seven-string guitars were used on the tracks [...] "Scarstruck" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Pain," [...] the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the B.C. Rich guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the KKV) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought [...] "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," [...] so he wrote another, going on to comment [...] "you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to make up a seven-string riff." [...] The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.|$|E

2500|$|Straczynski set five {{goals for}} Babylon 5.

It would have to be reasonably budgeted, and [...] "it would have to look unlike anything ever seen before on TV, presenting individual stories against a much broader canvas." [...] He further stressed that his approach was [...] "to take [...] seriously, to build characters for grown-ups, to incorporate real science but keep the characters {{at the center of the}} story." [...] Some of the staples of television science fiction were also out of the question (the show would have [...] "no kids or cute robots"). The idea was not to present a perfect utopian future, but one with greed and homelessness; one where characters grow, develop, live, and die; one where not everything was the same at the end of the day's events. Citing Mark Twain as an influence, Straczynski said he wanted the show to be a mirror to the real world and to covertly teach.|$|E

2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII. In discussing the decision to create a proprietary operating system instead of adopting an off-the-shelf platform such as Android, Heins noted, [...] "If you look at other suppliers' ability to differentiate, there's very little wiggle room. We looked at it seriouslybut if you understand what the promise of BlackBerry is to its user base it's all about getting stuff done. Games, media, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> at it but we have to support those guys who are ahead of the game. Very little time to consume and enjoy contentif you stay true to that purpose you have to build on that basis. And if we want to serve that segment we can't do it on a me-too approach." [...] Chief Operating Officer Kristian Tear remarked [...] "We want to regain our position as the number one in the world", while Chief Marketing Officer Frank Boulben proclaimed [...] "It could be the greatest comeback in tech history.

Another rule <b>was</b> not <b>to</b> use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|R
