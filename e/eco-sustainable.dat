40|$|Because {{deforestation}} {{and soil}} erosion destroy extensive areas of productive land, they constitute {{the biggest challenges}} to social and economic development in Mali. Between 1980 and 1989, land cultivation acquired 300, 000 to 400, 000 hectares per year of forested land. Soil erosion affects as much as 60 % to 80 % of productive land during periods of heavy rainfalls. ^ The {{study was conducted in}} three villages in Southern Mali. Its purpose was to understand how differing perspectives among farmers, extension agents, planners, and researchers influenced practices and policies related to an <b>eco-sustainable</b> agricultural system in Mali. Data were gathered using a combination of ethnographic techniques, participant observation, informal conversations, and semi-structured open-ended interviews. Data were coded and sorted according to themes and patterns. The themes and patterns were analyzed in terms of their relevance to the statement of purpose and research questions. ^ The study revealed that farmers, researchers, extension agents, and planners were all aware of the deforestation and soil erosion related problems as well as the consequences of these problems to the agricultural production processes, as well as related impacts on the lives of people in Mali. However, differences in attitudes, prior experiences, and worldviews among these key players led to differences in perspectives with respect to government protection and management policy related to deforestation and soil erosion. Because of these differing perspectives, ecological imperatives for <b>eco-sustainable</b> natural resource conservation and management have not yet emerged in Mali. ^ The results suggest that solutions to deforestation and soil erosion related problems in Mali would best be developed through an interactive, collaborative, and cogenerative learning process that includes all stakeholders; enhances their interactions; synchronizes their attitudes, experiences, worldviews; and facilitates on-going, reflective dialogues. The results also suggest that such a cogenerative learning system will accelerate the development of an <b>eco-sustainable</b> agriculture in Mali. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that about 2 % of global carbon dioxide emissions can be attributed to IT systems. Green (or sustainable) computing refers to supporting business critical computing needs with the least possible amount of power. This phenomenon changes the priorities in the design of new software systems and in the way companies handle existing ones. In this paper, we present the results of a research project aimed to develop a migration strategy to give an existing software system a new and more <b>eco-sustainable</b> lease of life. We applied a strategy for migrating a subject system that performs intensive and massive computation to a target architecture based on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We validated our solution on a system for path finding robot simulations. An analysis on execution time and energy consumption indicated that: (i) the execution time of the migrated system is less than the execution time of the original system; and (ii) the migrated system reduces energy waste, so suggesting that it is more <b>eco-sustainable</b> than its original version.

40|$|Magnesium-based cement {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} <b>eco-sustainable</b> alternatives to standard cementitious binders. The reasons for the interest towards this material are twofold: (i) its production process, using magnesium silicates, brine or seawater, dramatically reduces CO 2 emissions with respect to Portland cement production, and (ii) it is very well suited to applications in radioactive waste encapsulation. In spite of its potential, assessment of the structural properties of its binder phase (magnesium silicate hydrate or M-S-H) is far from complete, especially because of its amorphous character. In this work, a comprehensive structural characterization of M-S-H was obtained using a multi-technique approach, including a detailed solid-state NMR investigation and, in particular, for the first time, quantitative 29 Si solid-state NMR data. M-S-H was prepared through room-temperature hydration of highly reactive MgO and silica fume and was monitored for 28 days. The results clearly evidenced the presence in M-S-H of "chrysotile-like" and "talc-like" sub-nanometric domains, which are approximately in a 1 : 1 molar ratio after long-time hydration. Both these kinds of domains have a high degree of condensation, corresponding to the presence of a small amount of silanols in the tetrahedral sheets. The decisive improvement obtained in the knowledge of M-S-H structure paves the way for tailoring the macroscopic properties of <b>eco-sustainable</b> cements by means of a bottom-up approach...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} the motivational domains of Schwartz’s theory of basic human values influence Italian consumers ’ attitude towards buying <b>eco-sustainable</b> food products {{and the extent to which}} the average monthly amount of money available in households for grocery expenditure may modify this influence. A conceptual model of attitude with the high-order dimensions of the Schwartz’s taxonomy of human values and past experience as predictors has been hypothesized and performed on a representative sample (i. e., on regional basis and age categories) of Italian food consumers (n = 2760). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used as the methodology. Italian consumers ’ households with an average monthly amount of less than 400 Euros for grocery expenditures showed universal values and self-enhancement motivations in supporting their positive attitude towards <b>eco-sustainable</b> food products, but with a significant reduction of their openness to change and conservation in disfavor of these products. Consumers with more than 400 Euros showed attenuated universal and conservation values, but with less openness to change and self-enhancement motives. In conclusion, it has seemed that in Italy, where no legal requirements about sustainability have been established yet, being an ethical and universal food consumer still strongly depends on how much money one is able to spend rather than on how ethical or universal one wants to be...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the possibility of architecture <b>eco-sustainable</b> development {{from the point of view}} of energy, space and environmental heritage, based on the constructive process of some species of social wasps (Hymenoptera) and termites (Isoptera). It aimed at understanding via computational modelling and physical prototipation how their spacial design is developed by the “architect-insects” while they build their nests in nature as a way of preserving their bio-cultural heritage besides exploring other possibilites of <b>eco-sustainable</b> technological innovation within low energy consumption. The present work has been made to complement and converge the researches made both in the biomimicry area and the energy field by presenting how one can adapt the solutions in the built space of wasp nests and termite mounds that can be used in many ways at human constructions. Departing from some remarkable work done by entomologists, biologists and engineers, it was possible to get to structural details and how these tiny creatures build their dwellings little by little while they work as a united civilization. After getting to these details, strenghts and weaknesses were reported and one searched similar architectural human solutions for topics such as the crafting work on the surface of the buildings, the ventilation system created by the termites and the improvement of living spaces. By following the life of these little creatures and seeing how they can behave similarly to a human society up to an extent, one notes that one might learn and find architectural solutions by better understanding wasps and termites form-function challenges. </p...|$|E
