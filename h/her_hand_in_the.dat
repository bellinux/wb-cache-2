500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, while the teacher desperately looks {{for someone else to}} call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1980, John Lennon heard Lene Lovich and the B-52's' Rock Lobster on {{vacation}} in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono's musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream (the band in fact had been influenced by Ono). In addition to her collaborations with experimental artists including John Cage and jazz legend Ornette Coleman, many other musicians, particularly those of the new wave movement, have paid tribute to Ono (both as an artist in her own right, and as a muse and iconic figure). For example, Elvis Costello recorded a version of Ono's song [...] "Walking on Thin Ice", the B-52's (who drew from her early recordings) covered [...] "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] (shortening the title to [...] "Don't Worry"), and Sonic Youth included a performance of Ono's early conceptual [...] "Voice Piece for Soprano" [...] on their experimental album [...]|$|E

500|$|White Zombie {{was filmed}} in eleven days in March 1932 and {{was shot at}} the Universal Studios lot and Bronson Canyon on such a small budget {{that it had to}} film at night. Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn, the {{majority}} of the cast in White Zombie were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era. By the time Lugosi appeared in White Zombie, he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, Dracula. Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for White Zombie. Claims range between US$500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for White Zombie on Lugosi's tax returns. The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning when they would come on to the set. In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that [...] "Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type" [...] on set.|$|E
500|$|The group played eight {{songs to}} a crowd of 25,000 people. Before {{the start of the}} Plastic Ono Band's performance, they were {{introduced}} by Kim Fowley, and Lennon said to the crowd that the group were going to play only songs that they actually knew. They performed the Beatles's [...] "Yer Blues", because Clapton had performed it with Lennon for the Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, and his two solo songs, [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] and [...] "Cold Turkey", the latter of which had its premiere at the festival. [...] "Cold Turkey", presented as [...] "the newest song that John wrote" [...] by Ono, had Lennon reading the lyrics off a clip-board. Ono selected a song that was to be B-side of [...] "Cold Turkey," [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)", which also had its premiere at the festival. Shortly before the band went into [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko", Lennon announced that Ono was [...] "gonna do her thing all over you". The band closed with an electric version of the Wedding Album track [...] "John John (Let's Hope for Peace)", an extended experimental number consisting of her screaming the title repeatedly to the feedback of the electric guitars. The number, and the Plastic Ono Band's participation in the concert, ended with the band's departure from stage leaving their guitars and bass to resonate until Mal Evans turned off the amplifiers. With their stage remarks, Lennon and Ono linked their appearance there to their ongoing campaign for peace.|$|E
500|$|When Lennon {{was invited}} to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she {{released}} Fly, a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including [...] "Midsummer New York" [...] and [...] "Mind Train", {{in addition to a}} number of Fluxus experiments. [...] She also received minor airplay with the ballad [...] "Mrs. Lennon". [...] The track [...] "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] was an ode to Ono's missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. That same year, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko; Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. It was during this time that she wrote [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album Live Peace in Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of [...] "Happy Christmas (War Is Over)" [...] when Yoko whispers [...] "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, [...] "Happy Christmas, Julian." [...] The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, [...] "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" [...] has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally handicapped children organized by WABC-TV's Geraldo Rivera.|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] (also {{known as}} [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for a Hand in the Snow)" [...] or [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko") {{is a song}} by Yoko Ono that was {{originally}} released by Plastic Ono Band in October 1969 as the B-side of John Lennon's single [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] and was later released on Ono's 1971 album Fly. [...] Several live versions have been released, including on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 and Some Time in New York City in 1972. [...] An early version was titled [...] "Mum's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow." [...] It has been covered by several other artists.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] consist {{primarily}} of Ono wailing the phrase [...] "don't worry." [...] On the live version included on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 the phrase [...] "mummy's only looking for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow" [...] is also included. [...] The song is driven primarily by a blues-based guitar riff played by Lennon and Eric Clapton. [...] John Blaney describes the riff as [...] "hypnotic." [...] Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish describe that Lennon and Clapton alternate between a [...] "lilting semi-slide" [...] groove and playing [...] "sniping bites." [...] The other musicians on the studio version are Klaus Voorman on bass guitar and Ringo Starr on drums. According to Bielen and Urish, Starr's drumming variations {{ensure that the}} tension keeps mounting.|$|E
2500|$|... "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] was {{inspired}} by Lennon's and Ono's custody fight with Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox over Cox's and Ono's daughter Kyoko, representing Ono's attempt to communicate with her daughter. Ono and Kyoko were finally reunited in the 1990s when Kyoko was in her thirties.|$|E

2500|$|On initial {{pressings}} of the album, {{the seventh}} track was [...] "Don't Worry", a cover {{version of the}} Yoko Ono song [...] "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)". However, the song was removed during later pressings due to legal issues. On subsequent pressings, the song was replaced with [...] "Legal Tender"'s B-side, [...] "Moon 83", a remake of their earlier track [...] "There's a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{version of}} [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] {{included}} on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 was recorded at Varsity Stadium in Toronto, Canada on September 13, 1969. The Plastic Ono Band for that performance was assembled {{on short notice}} and included Ono, Lennon, Clapton, Voorman and Alan White on drums. [...] After Lennon played some of his recent songs and rock 'n' roll classics, Ono sang a two-song set consisting of [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] followed by [...] "John John (Let's Hope for Peace)." [...] Audience reaction to her set was muted, and some booing was reported, more directed at [...] "John John" [...] than [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko." [...] John Blaney explains that the audience [...] "had come to listen to good ol' rock 'n' roll, not a Japanese woman screaming {{at the top of}} her voice," [...] but [...] "one could at least get into the groove of 'Don't Worry Kyoko.'" [...] Chip Madinger and Mark Easter claim that despite the audience's cold reception, the band [...] "did an admirable job" [...] backing Ono on the song. Ken Bielen and Ben Urish claim that the audience may have been startled by [...] "Ono's full-throttle vocals and Lennon and Clapton's hard core guitar sounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{version of}} the song, titled [...] "Mum's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow" [...] was sung by Ono at Queen Charlotte's Hospital while she was being observed during her pregnancy with Lennon's child, a pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage. Lennon provides the sole accompaniment on acoustic guitar. [...] This version was originally released by Aspen magazine and was later included as a bonus track on the CD reissue of the couple's Wedding Album. The studio version released as a single and on Fly was recorded on October 3, 1969 at Lansdowne Studios in London. The single has the words [...] "PLAY LOUD" [...] written on the label, as does [...] "Cold Turkey" [...] on the other side.|$|E

2500|$|Kuraki started 2002 {{with her}} {{eleventh}} single, [...] "Winter Bells", in January. [...] "Winter Bells" [...] debuted atop {{of the charts}} and was the tenth opening for the anime adaptation of the manga Detective Conan. Before releasing her third album, Fairy Tale (October 2002), Kuraki released two single: [...] "Feel Fine!" [...] (April) and [...] "Like a Star in the Night" [...] (September) both singles entered Top 2. Like its predecessors Fairy Tale debuted atop of the Oricon chart. The album won the [...] "Rock & Pop album of the Year" [...] award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards. Kuraki once again tried <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. market.

2500|$|The {{ship was}} named after Cutty-sark, the {{nickname}} of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns's 1791 poem Tam o' Shanter. The ship's figurehead, the original {{of which has been}} attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall, is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horse's tail in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> poem she wore a linen [...] (Scots: a short chemise or undergarment), that she had been given as a child, which explains why it was cutty, or in other words far too short. The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out [...] " [...] done, Cutty-sark", which subsequently became a well known catchphrase. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to 'good taste'. Tam o' Shanter riding Meg was to be seen along the ship's quarter. The motto, Where there's a Willis away, was inscribed along the taffrail. The Tweed, which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her, had a figurehead depicting Tam o' Shanter.|$|E
2500|$|Music critic Johnny Rogan {{considers}} [...] "Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for <b>Her</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Snow)" [...] to be [...] "arguably Yoko Ono's finest recorded moment." [...] Lennon {{claimed that}} the song was [...] "one of the fuckin' best rock 'n' roll records ever made." [...] Of the live version issued on Some Time in New York City, Lennon {{claimed that the}} musicians were [...] "inspired out of their skulls" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "the most fantastic music [...] ever heard." [...] Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish call that version [...] "a stunning masterwork." [...] Of the studio version, Bielen and Urish praise it as [...] "the standout inclusion on Fly," [...] calling it [...] "an amazing achievement," [...] particularly the guitar work of Lennon and Clapton, Starr's [...] "slowly varying drum work" [...] and Ono's vocal, which they call [...] "one of her most effective." [...] The New York Times Kozinn calls the song a [...] "searing rocker." [...] The Los Angeles Times Hochman describes the song as [...] "a raw, anguished cry from the soul." [...] Author Bruce Pollock describes it has having [...] "frenzied glory." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking {{out of the corner of}} her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
