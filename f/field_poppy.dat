6000|$|... is a {{familiar}} verse from Cymbeline; any {{one can see the}} resemblance to the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of any person with a delicate skin. Purples and purplish reds in masses are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in frosty weather in winter, when the eyes sparkle and the face glows with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and after outdoor exercise. The skin purples and purple-reds here described are beautiful, and may be matched to a nicety in many flowers; the human purple may be seen (to name a very common wild flower) in purple loosestrife and the large marsh mallow, and in dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers; and the purple-red hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common hounds' tongue, and in other dark and purple-red flowers. But we always find, I fancy, that the expression due to human association in a purple flower is greatest when this colour (as in the human face) is placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink. I think we may see this even in a small flower like the fumitory, in which one portion is deep purple {{and all the rest of}} the blossoms a delicate pink. Even when the red is very intense, as in the common <b>field</b> <b>poppy,</b> the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident.|$|E

40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds fumitory, fat hen and <b>field</b> <b>poppy</b> are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, spear thistle and curled dock are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that diclofop-methyl has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, <b>field</b> <b>poppy,</b> fumitory and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of fumitory and fat hen are influenced by application of ethofumesate. Chemical analysis shows that ethofumesate can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of fumitory and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + diclofop-methyl. Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to ethofumesate, by environmental conditions. Plant responses at both sites demonstrated that the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation of diclofop-methyl, would, in admixture with diquat produce the same result compared with the current diquat/diclofop-methyl treatmen...|$|E

40|$|Many {{flowering}} plants are hermaphrodite, which poses {{the problem of}} self-fertilisation and the subsequent loss of genetic fitness in the offspring. To prevent this, plants have developed a genetically controlled mechanism called self-incompatibility (SI) which allows self (incompatible) pollen to be recognised and rejected before fertilisation can occur. The SI response of Papaver rhoeas (<b>field</b> <b>poppy)</b> has been extensively studied at the molecular and cellular level. Rejection of incompatible pollen occurs on the stigma surface when the pollen S-determinant PrpS, a transmembrane protein, interacts with the stigmatic S-determinant, secreted S-proteins. This triggers a calcium-mediated signalling cascade that targets the cytoskeleton and results in programmed cell death (PCD) of incompatible pollen. Work presented in this thesis investigated the localisation of PrpS and S-proteins. Other studies investigated {{the role of the}} cytoskeleton in SI. These demonstrated the involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton for the first time. Microtubules were rapidly depolymerised and this was implicated in signalling to PCD. The actin cytoskeleton has previously been shown to exhibit biphasic alterations during SI involving depolymerisation, followed by formation of F-actin foci. Studies described here represent the first steps toward characterisation of the F-actin foci. Their potential involvement in PCD and signalling is discussed.

40|$|The correct {{development}} of multicellular organisms {{depends upon the}} perception of signals secreted by cells in order to co-ordinate cell differentiation. The Physcomitrella patens genome encodes many components of potential signaling systems, including putative receptor proteins and putative secreted protein ligands, yet at present little characterization of these proteins has been carried out. We are currently attempting to characterize the expression pattern and function {{of a family of}} 6 secreted proteins exhibiting homology to PrsS, the ligand that controls self-incompatibility (SI) in Papaver rhoeas (<b>field</b> <b>poppy).</b> In poppy, PrsS interacts a receptor on the surface of pollen tubes, PrpS causing SI by programmed cell death. Homologues of this protein (SPH – S-Protein Homologues) exist in dicotyledonous plants and bryophytes but not in other plant taxa. We aim to determine spatiotemporal expression differences between these proteins via reporter gene analysis and qPCR of cDNA. In addition {{we are in the process}} of creating targeted gene knockouts for all 6 of the genes in P. patens. We are also searching for receptors of PrpS in Physcomitrella using a bioinformatic strategy alongside phage display. In accomplishing this we hope to determine the function of a small novel secreted protein family in Physcomitrella but in addition we also hope to elucidate the function of SPH proteins in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Signal {{perception}} and {{the integration of}} signals into networks that effect cellular changes is essential for all cells. The self-incompatibility (SI) response in <b>field</b> <b>poppy</b> pollen triggers a Ca 2 +-dependent signaling cascade that results in the inhibition of incompatible pollen. SI also stimulates dramatic alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. By measuring the amount of filamentous (F-) actin in pollen {{before and during the}} SI response, we demonstrate that SI stimulates a rapid and large reduction in F-actin level that is sustained for at least 1 h. This represents quantitative evidence for stimulus-mediated depolymerization of F-actin in plant cells by a defined biological stimulus. Surprisingly, there are remarkably few examples of sustained reductions in F-actin levels stimulated by a biologically relevant ligand. Actin depolymerization also was achieved in pollen by treatments that increase cytosolic free Ca 2 + artificially, providing evidence that actin is a target for the Ca 2 + signals triggered by the SI response. By determining the cellular concentrations and binding constants for native profilin from poppy pollen, we show that profilin has Ca 2 +-dependent monomeric actin-sequestering activity. Although profilin is likely to contribute to stimulus-mediated actin depolymerization, our data suggest a role for additional actin binding proteins. We propose that Ca 2 +-mediated depolymerization of F-actin may be a mechanism whereby SI-induced tip growth inhibition is achieved...|$|E
40|$|Self-incompatibility (SI) {{in higher}} plants is an {{important}} mechanism to prevent inbreeding and involves specific rejection of incompatible (“self”) pollen. In <b>field</b> <b>poppy</b> (Papaver rhoeas), S proteins encoded by the stigma component of the S-locus interact with incompatible pollen, resulting in cessation of tip growth. This “self” interaction triggers a Ca 2 +-dependent signaling network, involving programmed cell death (PCD). We previously identified p 56, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that is activated during the SI response in incompatible pollen. Here, we show that p 56 cross-reacts with AtMPK 3, but not with AtMPK 4 or salicylic acid-induced protein kinase antibodies. We provide good evidence that a MAPK is involved in initiation of SI-induced PCD in incompatible pollen. SI rapidly reduces pollen viability and the MAPK cascade inhibitor U 0126, which prevents the SI-induced activation of p 56 in incompatible pollen, “rescues” incompatible pollen, while its negative analog, U 0124, does not. This strongly implicates the involvement of a MAPK in SI-mediated loss of pollen viability and cell death. SI also stimulates caspase- 3 -like (DEVDase) activity and later DNA fragmentation. Both these markers of PCD are significantly reduced by pretreatment with U 0126, implicating the involvement of a MAPK in signaling during early PCD. As p 56 {{appears to be the}} only MAPK activated by SI, our studies imply that p 56 could be the MAPK involved in mediating SI-induced PCD...|$|E

40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} {{is a key}} regulator {{of plant}} morphogenesis, sexual reproduction, and cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. During the self-incompatibility response of Papaver rhoeas L. (<b>field</b> <b>poppy)</b> pollen, the actin filament network is rapidly depolymerized by a flood of cytosolic free Ca 2 + that results in cessation of tip growth and prevention of fertilization. Attempts to model this dramatic cytoskeletal response with known pollen actin-binding proteins (ABPs) revealed that the major G-actin-binding protein profilin can account for {{only a small percentage}} of the measured depolymerization. We have identified an 80 -kDa, Ca 2 +-regulated ABP from poppy pollen (PrABP 80) and characterized its biochemical properties in vitro. Sequence determination by mass spectrometry revealed that PrABP 80 is related to gelsolin and villin. The molecular weight, lack of filament cross-linking activity, and a potent severing activity are all consistent with PrABP 80 being a plant gelsolin. Kinetic analysis of actin assembly/disassembly reactions revealed that substoichiometric amounts of PrABP 80 can nucleate actin polymerization from monomers, block the assembly of profilin-actin complex onto actin filament ends, and enhance profilin-mediated actin depolymerization. Fluorescence microscopy of individual actin filaments provided compelling, direct evidence for filament severing and confirmed the actin nucleation and barbed end capping properties. This is the first direct evidence for a plant gelsolin and the first example of efficient severing by a plant ABP. We propose that PrABP 80 functions at the center of the self-incompatibility response by creating new filament pointed ends for disassembly and by blocking barbed ends from profilin-actin assembly...|$|E

Self-Incompatibility-induced Programmed Cell Death in Papaver pollen {{involves}} dramatic acidification of the incompatible pollen tube cytosol. Plant Physiology, 167 (3), 766 - 779 Self-incompatibility (SI) is {{an important}} genetically controlled mechanism to prevent inbreeding in higher plants. SI involves highly specific interactions during pollination, resulting in the rejection of incompatible (self) pollen. Programmed cell death (PCD) {{is an important}} mechanism for destroying cells in a precisely regulated manner. SI in <b>field</b> <b>poppy</b> (Papaver rhoeas) triggers PCD in incompatible pollen. During SI-induced PCD, we previously observed a major acidification of the pollen cytosol. Here, we present measurements of temporal alterations in cytosolic pH ([pH]cyt); they were surprisingly rapid, reaching pH 6. 4 within 10 min of SI induction and stabilizing by 60 min at pH 5. 5. By manipulating the [pH]cyt of the pollen tubes in vivo, we show that [pH]cyt acidification is an integral and essential event for SI-induced PCD. Here, we provide evidence showing the physiological relevance of the cytosolic acidification and identify key targets of this major physiological alteration. A small drop in [pH]cyt inhibits the activity of a soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase required for pollen tube growth. We also show that [pH]cyt acidification is necessary and sufficient for triggering several key hallmark features of the SI PCD signaling pathway, notably activation of a DEVDase/caspase- 3 -like activity and formation of SI-induced punctate actin foci. Importantly, the actin binding proteins Cyclase-Associated Protein and Actin-Depolymerizing Factor are identified as key downstream targets. Thus, we have shown the biological relevance of an extreme but physiologically relevant alteration in [pH]cyt {{and its effect on}} several components in the context of SI-induced events and PCD. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>poppy,</b> Papaver rhoeas L., is a {{very common}} weed in winter cereals in North-Eastern Spain. Its control is {{becoming}} difficult due to expanding herbicide resistance. To control field poppies there are alternative strategies such as non-chemical control that {{take into account the}} weed emergence period. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge of P. rhoeas emergence patterns in semi-arid conditions. Thus, here we conducted pot experiments on the emergence of P. rhoeas. We aimed to describe the emergence period and to quantify the emergence of a susceptible and of a herbicide-resistant P. rhoeas population at two locations in Catalonia, Spain, from 1998 to 2001 and until 2004 at one of them. Therefore, pots containing seeds of both populations were established at the two locations and emergence was recorded monthly. We studied the origin of the population, the sowing location, the effect of cultivation and the sowing year. First, we found that the main emergence peaks in our experiments occurred in autumn, accounting for between 65. 7 and 98. 5 % of the annual emergence from October to December, and only little emergence was recorded in spring. This emergence pattern is different from those found in the literature corresponding to Northern European countries, where in some cases main flushes occur only in autumn, in spring and winter or only in spring. The emergence was mainly affected by cultivation, but the effect of light stimulus was observed several months later. As a consequence, cultivation should be done in early autumn, promoting emergence during the whole autumn and winter so that emerged seedlings can be controlled before sowing a spring crop. Second, most experiments showed that the emergence was significantly higher in the first autumn than in the following seasons, e. g. 4. 1 % emergence in the first year and only 2. 1, 2. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 6 % new emergence at one of the locations for the second, third, fourth and fifth years. Thus, after having a severe P. rhoeas infestation causing a big seed rain, emergence should be stimulated by autumn cultivation in the following season and seedlings controlled by trying to deplete the soil seed bank as much as possible. Despite the fact that emergence will be staggered throughout several years and that there was a significant relationship between rainfall and emergence, so that dry years will cause a smaller emergence rate of the weed, these findings define a cultural management strategy to reduce P. rhoeas infestations and to contribute to integrated weed management strategies combining it with other tools...|$|E
