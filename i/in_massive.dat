5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> formations that often resulted in serious injuries.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>massive</b> stars, heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results {{in the production of}} the stable isotope iron-56, an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.|$|E

5|$|Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a U.S. {{hedge fund}} used for trading {{strategies}} such as fixed income arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, and pairs trading, combined with high leverage.

5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion process <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> stars {{but some}} is made in the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{scarcity}} of labour and abundance of land induced a high marginal product of labour. European immigrants (chiefly Italians, Spaniards, French and Germans), tempted by the high wages, arrived in droves.

5|$|The table below {{lists the}} known reasons for core {{collapse}} <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> stars, {{the types of}} star that they occur in, their associated supernova type, and the remnant produced. The metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium, {{as compared to the}} Sun. The initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the Sun's mass, although the mass {{at the time of the}} supernova may be much lower.|$|E
5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> {{and dense}} clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> {{unemployment in}} the late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E

5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through the woods and against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians entrenched in the heights resulted <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{neoconservative}} {{aspirations to}} use the United States' military power to further destroy evildoers are thrown off track by the election of George H. W. Bush to the presidency, followed by the election in 1992 of Bill Clinton which left them totally out of power. The neoconservatives, along with their conservative Christian allies, attempt to demonize Clinton throughout his presidency with various real and fabricated stories of corruption and immorality. To their disappointment, the American people do not turn against Clinton. Meanwhile, Islamist attempts at revolution end <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> bloodshed, leaving the Islamists without popular support. Zawahiri and bin Laden flee to the relative safety of Afghanistan and declare a new strategy. To fight Western-inspired moral decay, they must deal a blow to its source: the United States.|$|E
5|$|In a statement, an EMI {{spokesperson}} {{maintained that}} the label {{had been forced to}} take procedural, legal steps in order to protect their investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management. However, Thirty Seconds to Mars also expressed dissatisfaction with the then-recent Terra Firma takeover of EMI, as most of the employees the band had worked with were fired {{as a result of a}} major restructuring under TF chairman Guy Hands. The band were among several of the label's artists, unhappy with the transition, who quickly tried to terminate their contracts; the list also included The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney.

5|$|On 3 March, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. It {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> territorial {{losses for}} Russia, with 26% {{of the former}} Empire's population, 37% of its agricultural harvest area, 28% of its industry, 26% of its railway tracks, and three-quarters of its coal and iron deposits being transferred to German control. Accordingly, the Treaty was deeply unpopular across Russia's political spectrum, and several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest. After the Treaty, Sovnarkom focused on trying to foment proletarian revolution in Germany, issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in the country; the German government retaliated by expelling Russia's diplomats. The Treaty nevertheless failed to stop the Central Powers' defeat; in November 1918, the German Emperor Wilhelm II resigned and the country's new administration signed the Armistice with the Allies. As a result, Sovnarkom proclaimed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk void.|$|E
5|$|Risks to {{internal}} security: According to Czech Ministry of Interior, the main {{danger of the}} proposal rested <b>in</b> <b>massive</b> transfer of now legal firearms into illegality, with up {{to hundreds of thousands}} of legal firearms entering black market. While the original Commission proposal would affect 40,000 – 50,000 firearms legally possessed by Czech citizens, Dutch EU Council Presidency proposal of 4 April 2016 would affect some 400,000 legally owned firearms, i.e. making half of all Czech legally owned firearms illegal with large proportion of gun owners likely refusing to surrender their firearms. The proposal as such is in direct contradiction with Ministry’s long-term objective of lowering of number of illegal firearms and of conducting effective supervision of firearm owners.|$|E
