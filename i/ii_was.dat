40|$|ESO {{spectra of}} HD 65949 {{show it to}} be unlike any of the {{well-known}} types within its temperature range ≈ 13600 K. It is neither a silicon, nor a mercury-manganese star, though it has a huge Hg II line at λ 3984. We estimate (Hg/H) + 12. 0 ≈ 7. 4. This is higher than any published stellar mercury abundance. HD 65949 {{is a member of}} a nearby open cluster, NGC 2516, which is only slightly older than the Pleiades, and has been of recent interest because of its numerous X-ray emission stars, including HD 65949 itself, or a close companion. A longitudinal magnetic field of the order of - 290 Gauss at the 4. 7 σ level was very recently diagnosed from accurate circular spectropolarimetric observations with FORS 1 at the VLT. The spectral lines are sharp, allowing a thorough identification study. Second spectra of Ti, Cr, and Fe <b>are</b> rich. Mn <b>II</b> <b>is</b> well identified but not unusually strong. Numerous lines of S II and P <b>II</b> <b>are</b> found, but not Ga II. The resonance lines of Sr <b>II</b> <b>are</b> strong. While many Y <b>II</b> lines <b>are</b> identified, and Nb <b>II</b> <b>is</b> very likely present, no Zr <b>II</b> lines <b>were</b> found. Xe <b>II</b> <b>is</b> well identified. Strong absorptions from the third spectra of the lanthanides Pr, Nd, and Ho are present, but lines from the second spectra of lanthanides are extremely weak or absent. Among lines from the heavier elements, those of Pt <b>II</b> <b>are</b> clearly present, and the heaviest isotope, ^ 198 Pt, is indicated. The uncommon spectrum of Re <b>II</b> <b>is</b> certain, while Os II and Te <b>II</b> <b>are</b> highly probable. Several of the noted anomalies are unusual for a star as hot as HD 65949.

40|$|The decatenation {{activity}} of DNA topoisomerase <b>II</b> <b>is</b> essential for viability as eukaryotic cells traverse mitosis. Phosphorylation {{has been shown}} to stimulate topoisomerase II activity in vitro. Here we show that topoisomerase <b>II</b> <b>is</b> a phosphoprotein in yeast and that the level of incorporated phosphate is significantly higher at mitosis than in G 1. Comparison of tryptic phosphopeptide maps reveals that the major phosphorylation sites in vivo are targets for casein kinase II. Incorporation of phosphate into topoisomerase <b>II</b> <b>is</b> nearly undetectable at the non-permissive temperature in a conditional casein kinase II mutant. The sites modified by casein kinase <b>II</b> <b>are</b> located in the extreme C-terminal domain of topoisomerase <b>II.</b> This domain <b>is</b> absent in prokaryotic and highly divergent among eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, and may serve to regulate functions of topoisomerase <b>II</b> that <b>are</b> unique to eukaryotic cells...|$|R
