The purpose of gold flash to plate the entire surface of the <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>contact</b> with thin layer of soft gold for the purpose of SoIderatMty. Thickness of this gold flash should be from 5 - 8 microinches. It is found that addition of solid nickel when barrel plating with H.

ELECTROLESS PROCESSES: DEFINITIONS Because electroless deposition does not involve the passage of externally applied current to the system, some confusion over the use of the term electroless has resulted. Electroless deposition has been used synonymously with chemical deposition which can result from the following processes: (1) DisPlacement reactions. Depending on its position in the electrochemical series, a metal higher up in the series may be covered (plated) with the metal lower down in the series. A well known example is the coverage of iron with copper in an acidified copper sulphate solution. Two reactions, one anodic and the other cathodic, take place simultaneously at the surface of the iron...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{contacts}} must {{be reliable}} in the required life time under practical application. Reliability {{means that the}} contact resistance can maintain low and stable. Au-plated contact pairs have been used widely for weak current connectors due to its well electrical and anti-corrosion performance. The high price of gold forces manufacturers to reduce the thickness of Au-plated while maintaining well performance. Increasing thin of Au plating causes the microporosity to increase rapidly, which has harmful effect {{on the performance of}} connectors. Appropriate lubricant coated on contact pair is a solution to improve the contact property. This paper focuses on sliding contact performance of <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>contact</b> pairs coupon with 0. 25 m thickness and lubricated with water based lubricant named lub-E under damp heat and corrosion environment respectively. The contact pairs are also exposed in damp heat, corrosion environment respectively to evaluate the anti contamination property. The sliding experiment is conducted at frequency of 1 Hz, amplitude of 1 cm, and load of 0. 5 N, 1. 0 N and 1. 5 N. Contact resistance data is gotten in every sliding cycle at the condition of DC current 100 mA and limited voltage 1. 0 V. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the sliding track morphology and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is used to analyze the element...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the electrical contact resistance (ECR) measurements made on thin <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> (<b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> of <= 0. 5 mu m with a Ni underlayer of similar to 2 mu m) oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) Cu contacts in vacuum environment. ECR in <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> OFHC Cu <b>contacts</b> {{is found to}} be slightly higher than that in bare OFHC Cu contacts. Even though gold is a softer material than copper, the relatively high ECR values observed in <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>contacts</b> are mainly due to the higher hardness and electrical resistivity of the underlying Ni layer. It is well known that ECR is directly related to plating factor, which increases with increasing coating thickness when the electrical resistivity of coating material is more than that of substrate. Surprisingly, in the present case it is found that the ECR decreases with increasing gold layer thickness on OFHC Cu substrate (gold has higher electrical resistivity than OFHC Cu). It is analytically demonstrated from the topography and microhardness measurements results that this peculiar behavior is associated with thin gold platings, where the changes in surface roughness and microhardness with increasing layer thickness overshadow the effect of plating factor on ECR...|$|R

It is observed that the TCC in gaseous environment is significantly higher than that in vacuum due to the enhanced thermal gap conductance. It is found that for a given contact load and gas pressure, the thermal gap conductance for bare OFHC Cu contacts is higher than that for <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>contacts.</b> It {{is due to the}} difference in the molecular weights of copper and gold, which influences the exchange of kinetic energy between the gas molecules and contact surfaces.

Exposure control is manual or aperture priority automaticThe LX has excellent low-light performance using dynamic, off-the-film-plane TTL metering called Integrated Direct Metering (IDM).Pre-release exposure information is obtained from light reflected from a patterned shutter curtain back to the metering cell. This gives the values displayed in the viewfinder. Once the shutter is released, the light reflected from the film and/or the shutter curtains continues to be measured as the exposure takes place and is used to adjust the exposure time. Automatic exposure time is up to 125 seconds.This exposure metering has a range from EV1 to EV19 for manual exposure and a EV-5.5 to EV20 that is stepless in automatic making the camera excellent for available light photography.TTL flash control is also available using Pentax dedicated units (AF400T & AF280T), also taking measurements from the IDM during the exposure.

40|$|Contact {{resistance}} {{is the most}} important and universal characteristic of all types of electrical and thermal contacts. Accurate measurement of contact {{resistance is}} important, because it serves as a measure for judging the performance and operational life span of contacts. Rise in contact temperature {{is one of the major}} factors that pose a big threat to the stability of electrical contacts. Dissipation of heat by solid conduction through a contact interface is governed by its thermal contact conductance (TCC). This emphasizes the need to study the TCC of an electrical contact along with its electrical contact resistance (ECR). Simultaneous measurement of ECR and TCC is important for understanding the interconnection between these two quantities and the possible influence of one over another. Real time experimental data and analytical correlations can be extremely helpful in developing electrical contacts with improved thermal management capabilities. As a part of the experimental investigation, a test facility has been developed for making simultaneous measurement of ECR and TCC across flat contacts. The facility has the capability of measuring ECR and TCC over a wide range of operating parameters, such as contact pressure, contact temperature, interstitial gaseous media, ambient pressure, etc. It is also capable of determining the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of materials as a function of temperature, which is very helpful in analyzing the generated contact resistance data. Using this facility, simultaneous ECR and TCC measurements are made across bare and <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> <b>contacts</b> of OFHC Cu (oxygen free high conductivity copper) and brass. Simultaneous ECR and TCC measurements are made on nominally flat contacts in the contact pressure range of 0 – 1 MPa and the interface temperature range of 20 – 120 °C. Effect of contact pressure and interface temperature on ECR and TCC is studied on bare and gold coated contacts in vacuum, N 2, Ar, and SF 6 environments. TCC strongly depends on the thermophysical properties of the interstitial media and shows a significant enhancement in gaseous media, because of the increased interfacial gap conductance compared to vacuum. The gas pressure is varied in the range of 1 – 2. 6 bar to study its effect on the gap conductance at different contact pressures and interface temperatures. Minor increase in the ECR observed in gaseous media is found to be independent of the properties of the media. Experimental results indicated that ECR depends on the gas pressure as well as on the applied contact load. Effect of gold coating and its thickness on the ECR and TCC across OFHC Cu and brass contacts is studied. Measurements on electroplated gold specimens having different gold layer thicknesses (0. 1, 0. 3, and 0. 5 µm) indicated that ECR decreases and TCC increases with increasing gold coating thickness. Effect of gold coating on the substrate properties, contact surface tomography, and microhardness is analyzed and correlated to the observed behavior of ECR and thermal gap conductance. An attempt is made to understand and quantify the changes in the contact surface characteristics due to contact loading and heating, by measuring various surface topography parameters before and after the experimentation. Effect of thermal stresses (generated due to temperature variations) on ECR and TCC is studied and inclusion of an experimentally measured temperature dependent load correction factor is suggested in the theoretical models to take into account the effect of thermal stresses in contact assemblies...|$|R

To accomplish this, a <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coating of approximately 25 microns is required over all metal surfaces on the tube exterior. The gold has historically been <b>plated</b> using <b>gold</b> cyanide <b>plating</b> chemistry. In this work we proposed to replace the cyanide plating bath with an environmentally friendlier sulfite <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> bath. Low and high pH sulfite plating chemistries were investigated as possible replacements for the cyanide <b>gold</b> <b>plating</b> chemistry. The low pH plating chemistry demonstrated a <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coating which met the high purity, grain size, and hardness requirements for switch tubes. The high pH chemistry was rejected primarily because the hardness of the <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> coatings was too high and exceeded switch tube coating requirements. A problem with nodule formation on the <b>gold</b> <b>plated</b> surface using the low pH chemistry had to be resolved during this evaluation. The nodule formation was postulated to be produced by generation of SO{sub 2 } in the low pH bath causing gold to be precipitated out when the sulfite concentration falls below a minimum level. The problem was resolved by maintaining a higher sulfite concentration and providing an active filtration system during plating. In this initial study, there were no major obstacles found when using a sulfite gold bath for switch tube plating, however, further work is needed on bath control and bath life before adopting it as the primary plating chemistry...|$|R
