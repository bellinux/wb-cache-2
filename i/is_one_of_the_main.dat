5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants {{and the creation of}} genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> industrial ores of {{the element}} vanadium, {{which can be}} extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used {{as a source of}} lead. A common process for extracting the vanadium begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of vanadium pentoxide with calcium gives pure vanadium.|$|E

5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control {{and is one of}} the primary objectives of Brazil’s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.|$|E
