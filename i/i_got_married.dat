His mother was a poor widow, living near me, and when she heard about the ox-carts she came to me with her son and said, 'Neighbour Mariano, for your mother's sake, take my son and teach him to earn his bread, for he is a boy that loves not to do anything.' So I took Mula and paid the widow for his services after each journey. When there was no freight to be had I sometimes went to the lagoons to cut rushes, and, loading the carts with them, we would go about the country to sell the rushes to those who required them to thatch their houses. Mula loved not this work. Often when we were all day wading up to our thighs in the water, cutting the rushes down close to their roots, then carrying them in large bundles on our shoulders to land, he would cry, complaining bitterly of his hard lot. Sometimes I thrashed him, for it angered me to see a poor boy so fastidious: then he would curse me and say that some day he would have his revenge. 'When I am dead,' he often told me, 'my ghost will come to haunt and terrify you for all the blows you have given me.' This always made me laugh.|$|E

When he arrived, {{he was to}} Maude {{a never-ending}} miracle, she would have his crib brought into her room, and I would find her leaning over the bedside, gazing {{at him with a}} rapt {{expression}} beyond my comprehension. To me he was just a brick-red morsel of humanity, all folds and wrinkles, and not at all remarkable in any way. Maude used to annoy me by getting {{out of bed in the}} middle of the night when he cried, and at such times I was apt to wonder at the odd trick the life-force had played me, and ask myself why <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>married</b> at all. It was a queer method of carrying on the race. Later on, I began to take a cursory interest in him, to watch for signs in him of certain characteristics of my own youth which, in the philosophy of my manhood, I had come to regard as defects. And it disturbed me somewhat to see these signs appear. I wished him to be what I had become by force of will--a fighter. But he was a sensitive child, anxious for approval; not robust, though spiritual rather than delicate; even in comparative infancy he cared more for books than toys, and his greatest joy was in being read to. In spite of these traits--perhaps because of them--there was a sympathy between us. From the time that he could talk the child seemed to understand me. Occasionally I surprised him gazing at me with a certain wistful look that comes back to me as I write.|$|E
40|$|This {{beginning}} {{study would}} like to discuss about “how was the relationship which Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin I and Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin II had with the other kingdoms in the archipelago and Southeast Asia”. From {{the long history of}} the Palembang Sultanate, it was showed that since its early establishment, this kingdom has had relationship –especially through marriage bond, with other regions in the archipelago (Bangka and Jambi). During the reign of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin I, there was a closed relationship with Siantan because of the marriage of the Sultan and a princess of Siantan. This marriage not only led on the relationship between two kingdoms, Palembang Sultanate and Siantan Kingdom but also Johor Kingdom. Therefore, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin <b>I</b> <b>got</b> more power to capture Palembang and opened a tin mine in Bangka island. From this mine –which was firstly managed by the Sultan’s father in law (Wan Akub), Palembang became a major producer of tin in Southeast Asia and even in the world. The mine gave a great benefit for the Sultanate so that it grew as a very important sultanate at that time. Besides his first married with a princess of Siantan, Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin <b>I</b> also <b>got</b> <b>married</b> with a princess of Bugis (in the 17 th century the Bugis mariners controlled over {{the western part of the}} archipelago waterways). Broadening area and strengthening power through marriage was also done by Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin I. From the local chronicle, it was noted that the Sultan married a princess of Brunei, Masayu Kedaton (Masayu=very valuable, Kedaton=palace, meaning= a very valuable princess). Pangeran Surawijaya Syamsuddin was born from this marriage, furthermore he had a daughter named Raden Ayu Ber[q-l-y] Panembahan Ilman Hani. The princess <b>got</b> <b>married</b> with a brother of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II, namely Panembahan Bupati Hanim (a grandchild of Sultan Ahmad Najamuddin I). Obviously, it was an inter-royal family marriage, however it was a customary happening in the sultanate. Furthermore, Raden Ayu Kusuma Naqqiyyah was born from this marriage. Inevitably, various inter-island and inter-nation marriage which have been shown above created an integrity.

Two of the more popular quips are: [...] "Say, <b>I</b> hear you <b>got</b> <b>married.</b> How did that ever happen?" [...] "I was playing a split-bill in Peoria—and it rained!" [...] and [...] "Have you ever played Peoria?" [...] "Peoria? Oh, yes—I spent four years there one night!" [...] The widespread appeal of this verbal maligning by comics, actors and other performers suggests Peoria as a paramount example of the dull, banal, and provincial theatrical road stop. But the popularity of the [...] "put down" [...] suggests as well that the city possesses a theatrical heritage of considerable longevity.|$|R
