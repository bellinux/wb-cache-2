25|$|ISSR (for <b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat)</b> is {{a general}} term for a genome region between {{microsatellite}} loci. The complementary sequences to two neighboring microsatellites are used as PCR primers; the variable region between them gets amplified. The limited length of amplification cycles during PCR prevents excessive replication of overly long contiguous DNA sequences, so {{the result will be}} a mix of a variety of amplified DNA strands which are generally short but vary much in length.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the genetic diversity of Ligula intestinalis populations, nine <b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> (ISSR) markers were applied to populations from nine geographical areas {{around the world and}} 10 host species. The 110 loci selected from the ISSR patterns produced revealed high variability among the analysed samples, with a polymorphism of 100 % and a global coefficient of gene differentiation estimated by Neis index (GST) of 0. 776. Major genetic differentiation was found to be correlated to five broad geographical regions (Europe, China, Canada, Australia and Algeria). Nevertheless, no significant genetic variation was found among European isolates, although they originated from disparate geographical localities and⁄or unrelated hosts. Classical classification methods: maximum parsimony and factorial correspondence analysis were compared with an advanced statistical method: the self-organizing map (SOM). The results demonstrated that the ISSR approach is rapid and inexpensive and provides reliable markers to assess genetic diversity of L. intestinalis. Furthermore, SOM artificial neuronal networks are considered to provide an efficient alternative tool for mapping the genetic structures of parasite populations.

40|$|Hybrid {{speciation}} {{has played}} a significant role in the evolution of angiosperms at the polyploid level. However, relatively little is known about the importance of hybrid speciation at the diploid level. Two species of Penstemon have been proposed as diploid hybrid derivatives based on morphological data, artificial crossing studies, and pollinator behavior observations: Penstemon spectabilis (derived from hybridization between Penstemon centranthifolius and Penstemon grinnellii) and Penstemon clevelandii (derived from hybridization between P. centranthifolius and P. spectabilis). Previous studies were inconclusive regarding the purported hybrid nature of these species because of a lack of molecular markers sufficient to differentiate the parental taxa in the hybrid complex. We developed hypervariable nuclear markers using <b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> banding patterns to test these classic hypotheses of diploid hybrid speciation in Penstemon. Each species in the hybrid complex was genetically distinct, separated by 10 – 42 species-specific <b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> markers. Our data do not support the hybrid origin of P. spectabilis but clearly support the diploid hybrid origin of P. clevelandii. Our results further suggest that the primary reason diploid hybrid speciation is so difficult to detect is the lack of molecular markers able to differentiate parental taxa from one another, particularly with recently diverged species...|$|E

Pair-wise population genetic distance ranged from 0. 031  to 0. 283, {{with a mean of}} 0. 150 between populations. The highest inter-population average distance was between PaCU from Cuenca and YeCA from Cazorla, while the lowest distance was between TaMO from Morocco and MA Sierra Mágina populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and Nei’s genetic diversity analyses revealed higher genetic variation within the same population than among different populations. Genetic differentiation (Gst) was 0. 233. Cuenca showed the highest Nei’s genetic diversity followed by the Moroccan region, Sierra Mágina, and Cazorla region. However, clustering of populations was not in accordance with their geographical locations. Principal component analysis showed the presence of two major groups—Group 1 contained all populations from Cuenca while Group 2 contained populations from Cazorla, Sierra Mágina and Morocco—while Bayesian analysis revealed the presence of three clusters. The low genetic diversity observed in PaCU and YeCA is probably a consequence of inappropriate management since no estimation of genetic variability was performed before the silvicultural treatments.

A subsample of the VrnA F 2 mapping family of perennial ryegrass comprising 92 individuals was used to develop a linkage map including <b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeat</b> markers (ISSR). Twelve ISSR fragments out of 29 were mapped to the linkage groups (LG) LG 1, LG 2, LG 4, LG 6 and LG 7. The total map length was 250. 7 cM. Selected ISSR fragments were cloned by transformation into plasmid pTZ 57 R and sequenced. For four ISSRs, BLAST search revealed a significant similarity to coding regions of known sequences within the current DNA databases. An ISSR fragment of 580 bp, produced by the (GACA) 4 TC primer present on LG 6, showed a 95 % identity to the Avena sativa L. transposon and repetitive DNA linked to the receptor kinase gene.

40|$|Abstract: Microsatellites (SSR – simple <b>{{sequence}}</b> <b>repeats,</b> STR – short tandem repeats, SSLP – simple {{sequence length}} polymorphism, VNTR – variable number of tandem repeats) are {{the class of}} repetitive DNA sequences present in all living organisms. Particular characterstics of microsatellites, such as {{their presence in the}} genomes of all living organisms, high level of allelic variation, co-dominant mode of inheritance and potential for automated analysis make them an excellent tool for a number of approaches like genotyping, mapping and positional clonig of genes. The three most popular types of markers containing microsatellite sequences that are presently used are: (1) SSR (simple <b>sequence</b> <b>repeats),</b> generated by amplifying in a PCR reaction with the use of primers complementary to flanking regions; (2) ISSR (<b>inter-simple</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>repeats),</b> based on the amplification of regions between inversely oriented closely spaced microsatellites; and (3) SAMPL (selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci), which utilises AFLP (amplified fragment-length polymorphism) methodology, with one exception – for the second amplification, one of the starters is complementary to the microsatellite sequence.
