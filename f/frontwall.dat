50|$|At the <b>frontwall</b> of {{his house}} in the Sint-Martinusstraat (nr. 8) in Retie, there was, in earlier days, a stone with the {{engraving}} Hier leefde en stierf dichter Lodewijk De Koninck 1924 (e: Here lived and died the writer Lodewijk De Koninck 1924).|$|E
5000|$|It was {{my first}} <b>frontwall</b> mosaic (some 75m²). Afterwards I made seven more. Léger, meanwhile, was {{creating}} inside over the complete ambulatory a superb monumental suite in glass brick. He was very outspoken, with words that carried the day -So, my old friend- {{he said to me}} in front of my mosaic - do you always work in melodies ? This he accompanied with a slap on the shoulder fit to tumble an ox. Of Picasso, who he did not like he said to me: -You who are a writer why don't you tell them he is only small fry. (...de la petite mésure).|$|E
5000|$|His work is part {{of several}} museum {{collections}} such as the Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp and many private collections in Europe and abroud. Danny Matthys is today a major name in the Flemish [...] "Art - lending [...] " [...] project. Matthys discontinued {{a few years ago}} a rich career as a lecturer in art education. He was co-founder and professor of the Department Mixed Media within the KASK (art academy) of Hogeschool Gent. On the left front of the SMAK in Ghent is a huge work of him, made up of dozens of life-sized busts in pigmented concrete that is quite indestructible fixed in front of the famous museum. The work was previously conceived in an impressive horizontal drafting. Founding SMAK Director and Curator of Documenta IX in Kassel in 1992.Jan Hoet wanted ultimately to hang it on the museum left <b>frontwall.</b>|$|E
50|$|Not as {{frequently}} noted {{as some other}} elements of Chapman's style of play but nevertheless a tactic integral to his game is hooking the ball during the rally. Virtually every time Chapman hits a ball that rebounds off the <b>frontwall</b> to the floor, he throws a natural or reverse hook. He uses both his open hand and fist (punch) shots to impart spin to the ball and move it off its natural trajectory. He uses {{a lot of these}} shots to keep his opponent off balance. Just as his opponent sets his feet to hit the ball it fades away or jumps into his body and handcuffs him. Which way these shots are going to hop is hard to predict and they typically result in misses or set-ups. He frequently hooks his kill shots so the so that a retrieving player {{trying to get to the}} ball makes a hand error just when he thinks he has it.|$|E
30|$|To {{prove the}} {{authenticity}} of this extraction method, {{two different types of}} solar cell structure were used: a SAT monocrystalline silicon homostructure {{in the state of the}} art, and a <b>frontwall</b> Cu 2 S-CdS heterostructure with significant losses.|$|E
30|$|Our study {{concerns}} p-n junctions at both homo- and hetero-junctions: For the homo-junction, a 4  cm 2 blue type monocrystalline silicon cell {{produced by}} SAT (1980) was used. For the hetero-junction {{we have used}} a <b>frontwall</b> Cu 2 S-CdS cell produced by a wet (Cleveite) process with significant losses of 4.28  cm 2 square area. Two different numerical methods were applied in order to prove their authenticity.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic C-scans {{are used}} {{frequently}} to detect defects in composite components caused during fabrication and damage resulting from service conditions. Evaluation and characterization of defects and damage require experience and {{good understanding of}} the composites. Under low-velocity impact loading delamination is observed {{to be a major}} failure mode. In this paper, the results of extensive experimental work on damage of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates due to low-velocity impact are presented. The study was carried out on 10 different layups over four different thickness. Both drop-weight and projectile impacts simulating practical conditions like tool-drop and runway debris, respectively, were carried out at energy levels varying from 3 to 30 J. The ensuing delamination damage was determined by ultrasonic C-scans using the pulse-echo immersion method for both projected and layerwise distribution. While projected delamination was obtained by placing a gate over the backwall echo, layerwise distribution was obtained by successive time delay from the <b>frontwall</b> to the backwall echo covering each interface. Delamination areas were quantified accurately by processing the raw image data using a digital image processing technique. Based on the data obtained an empirical relation was established between the delamination area and the impact energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a live, synchronous distance delivery technology would facilitate interaction, immediacy, and presence between an instructor and his contiguous and remote classrooms, and whether it would facilitate interaction between the two groups of students. This study researched the opinions of students on whether they felt the platform facilitated interaction between the two groups of learners, both groups of learners and the instructor, and both groups of learners and the content. ^ This research followed the development and testing of a synchronous delivery platform that would replicate a traditional, interactive, classroom in a remote location. The research was conducted at a public university in two undergraduate construction management courses, over two successive semesters with different groups of students. The students and the instructor were observed and interviewed by an independent classroom observer. There were two main components of the delivery platform: the first was the synchronous, sidewall projection of the students in each room and the second was the synchronous, <b>frontwall</b> projection of the instructor and content to the students in the distant classroom. ^ The students in both classrooms reported the platform facilitated interaction, immediacy, and presence between the students in the remote classroom and the instructor. They further reported the sidewall projections did not facilitate learner-learner interaction between classrooms and did not necessarily feel learner-learner interaction was pertinent in either a distant or traditional classroom. The student 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of student-content interaction were mixed, with the results improving considerably in the final phase of this study. ^ Enough questions have been raised in this study to warrant further research into the effectiveness of synchronous distance instructional platforms using advanced technology. The results also indicate a need for further research into the causal relationships of immediacy and presence on cognitive learning. With minor improvements in equipment and environment, elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions could effectively adopt this system for use in replicating interactive, synchronous distance education classes in remote locations. ...|$|E
