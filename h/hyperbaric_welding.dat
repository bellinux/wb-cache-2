40|$|The CTOD {{toughness}} {{evaluation of}} repaired weld joints (given two weld deposits, complex mechanical heterogeneity and high residual stresses) requires modification of commonly used specimen geometry and testing procedure. This paper {{presents the results}} of the SENB specimens with shallow (a/W= 0. 16) and deep notches (a/W= 0. 5) extracted from 30 mm thick multipass submerged arc welded (SAW) joints which were repaired with <b>hyperbaric</b> (16 bar) <b>welding</b> process at the toe region of the original SAW weld deposit. The results of this study show that the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) measurements are consistent with the calculated CTOD values according to the BS 5762 standard for both deep and shallow cracked specimens (a/W= 0. 16) if the plastic rotation factor (r_p) value of 0. 25 is used in the latter. The problem of selection of yield stress for calculation of the CTOD according to the BS 5762 standard for highly heterogeneous repaired weld joints can be eliminated using the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) technique. It is important to realise that the through thickness deep and shallow notched specimens can produce lower bound toughness values if the notch accurately samples the local brittle zones. The later produced its lower bound values under the influence of overmatching <b>hyperbaric</b> repair <b>weld</b> joint despite its lower crack tip constraint. Surface notched specimens (a/W= 0. 4) where the very crack tip is controlled by one microstructure did not give lower bound thoughness values. (orig.)

50|$|Dry welding {{is used in}} {{preference}} to wet underwater welding when high quality welds are required because of the increased control over conditions which can be exerted, such as through application of prior and post weld heat treatments. This improved environmental control leads directly to improved process performance and a generally much higher quality weld than a comparative wet weld. Thus, when a very high quality weld is required, dry <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> is normally utilized. Research into using dry <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> at depths of up to 1000 m is ongoing. In general, assuring the integrity of underwater welds can be difficult (but is possible using various nondestructive testing applications), especially for wet underwater welds, because defects are difficult to detect if the defects are {{beneath the surface of}} the weld.|$|E

At last, droplets’ statues under different welding parameters were compared. The results show that the clear images of GMAW droplet separated from the noise background can be acquired, which makes the high-precision quantitative analysis of laser enhanced effect possible.

40|$|Three duplex {{stainless}} steels (Avesta 2205, Sandvik SAF 2507 and Zeron 100) were successfully welded automatically {{at a range}} of pressures from 1 to 32 bar. The gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding process was chosen as it allows {{a high degree of}} control to be exercised during welding. Initial autogenous bead on plate welds established the effects of pressure on the welding process and allowed the process parameters to be determined for subsequent experiments. Analysis of the effects of pressure on the weld thermal cycle showed that at higher pressures the precipitation of phases deleterious to the weld quality was less likely than at ambient pressure. It was also found that the arc melting efficiency increased as the pressure increased, which was taken into account when the process parameters for the joints were selected. A V-butt design with a "land" on each side was chosen for the joints to counteract any tendency for the welding arc to wander at higher welding pressures. The root welds were performed using pulsed current welding techniques to overcome the difficulties in achieving consistent penetration that were encountered when welding at lower pressures. It was found that by employing standard welding consumables commonly used for welding duplex steels at ambient pressure satisfactory austenite-ferrite phase balances could be achieved in the weld metal at all pressures. Metallographic examination of the welds showed that the joints did not have any microstructural complications that were related to pressure and mechanical testing revealed that, in terms of impact toughness, the weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ) performed as well as, if not better than, the parent plate material. This work shows that welding of {{duplex stainless}} steels using the <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> method is a viable option for subsea operations up to a depth of at least 320 m, automated <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> being advantageous at depths greater than 40 m...|$|E

40|$|Hyperbaric Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an {{important}} technology for repair welding of deep sea pipelines and linking of existing pipeline networks to newer ones through tie-ins and hot-tap welding. With increasing water depth the process becomes susceptible to hydrogen assisted cracking due to the very fast cooling rate of the weld caused by higher habitat gas density and resulting higher thermal diffusivity. Maintaining sufficient heat in the welding zone is vital to avoid a potential cracking tendency especially as moisture pick-up {{may be difficult to}} avoid during <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> operations. In addition to this, hyperbaric GMAW has a limitation of low heat input because it is operated at a short arc length or dip transfer mode to avoid process instability at high pressure. Also, the short arc length generates weld spatter that may affect weld quality. The research presented in this thesis, investigated the use of an industrial laser in conduction mode for the purpose of providing significant additional heat input to control the weld thermal cycles of GMAW. Advanced GMAW power sources such as the Fronius Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) and EWM ColdArc have also been investigated for reduced weld spatter generation. Studies were conducted to investigate the weld pool thermal cycles and resulting metallurgical phase formation in hyperbaric GMAW at different pressures ranging from 1 bar to 200 bar. This was followed by welding trials at one atmosphere to compare the process characteristics of traditional dip transfer GMAW with some advanced GMAW power sources such as CMT and ColdArc. The main experimental trials to investigate a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process were performed at one atmosphere condition. A thermal model was developed using Abaqus software to predict the weld metal and heat affected zone thermal cycle in a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process at one atmosphere and under high ambient pressures. Finally, investigation was carried out to evaluate the benefit of the laser assisted process in lowering diffusible hydrogen content from the weld metal. The hyperbaric GMAW experimental results showed that the weld pool cooling rate increases with pressure due to higher chamber gas density and resulting thermal diffusivity. But this effect is not prominent for thicker plates. Therefore, it was concluded that heat conduction through the steel thickness dominates convective losses to the chamber gas environment. It was also shown that the welding arc shrinks as pressure increases in order to minimise energy loss to the environment. This defined the weld bead profile; although it was found that beyond 100 bar pressure the weld penetration depth remained effectively unchanged. Apart from the hardness of the weld made at 1 bar, there was little difference between those at 18, 100 and 200 bar. However, all of the welds show hardness peaks greater than 350 HV 10 recommended for offshore structures. It was observed that CMT produced the lowest weld spatter compared to the traditional GMAW and ColdArc. However, this advantage is constrained to low wire feed speed (3 to 5 m/min) beyond which it becomes relatively unstable. For the laser assisted GMAW (CMT) trials, it was shown that the laser serves as a spatially resolved heat source, reheating the weld bead and reducing the cooling rate. For the laser parameters investigated, over 200 % reduction of cooling rate could be achieved when compared with GMAW alone. It was also demonstrated that the additional laser thermal input will extend the weld residence time at high temperature (over 300 °C). This will prolong the weld cooling time such that dissolved hydrogen can diffuse out before it comes to room temperature. The laser was shown to significantly reduce the weld peak hardness from about 420 HV 0. 5 to values below 350 HV 0. 5, which will be beneficial for <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding.</b> The model prediction of the weld thermal cycles was in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, it could be used to predict the weld metal and HAZ cooling rate of a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process although the model would need to be calibrated for higher pressure data. It was also demonstrated that additional laser heat can reduce the weld hydrogen content to acceptable limits of 5 ml/ 100 g of weld metal even for high moisture content in the welding environment. In conclusion, the addition of laser heating to GMAW will reduce the weld cooling rate, extend the weld pool cooling time, and expel diffusible weld hydrogen. All of these would be immensely beneficial in terms of improving the quality and reliability of structures fabricated through hyperbaric GMAW...|$|E
40|$|Clad pipes {{are used}} in the oil and gas {{industry}} for transportation of corrosive substances. Maintenance, repairs and tie-in connections to existing subsea structures is done by <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding.</b> There is per today no repair contingency available for clad pipes, so that a knowledge basis must be established in order to maintain pipeline integrity. Welding of clad pipes can result in a variety of complex microstructures due to the presence of dissimilar alloys. The difference in chemical composition and thermal properties will influence the integrity of the welded joint, and may result in a crack susceptible microstructure. Previous work has shown that carbon migration and subsequent carbide precipitation in the clad, mainly during production, results in a hardened region in the clad. After welding, this region is susceptible to cracking. However, adding a Ni-interlayer between the clad and base metal (BM) provides a solution to the cracking related to the formation of a hard zone in the clad. Nevertheless, cracks may also arise from hydrogen charging from welding or from cathodic protection (CP) or H 2 S during service, so that the cold cracking mechanisms of clad pipes is still highly relevant. In this master s thesis, clad pipes with and without a Ni-interlayer have been investigated. The dissimilar interface region and carbides in the clad adjacent to the interface have been investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The clad immediately adjacent to the interface contained Cr 23 C 6 carbides, present both inside grains and at grain boundaries. The dissimilar interface showed a jagged distribution of Ni towards the clad side and segregation of Cr to carbides. The dissimilar interface showed a lath-like structure, however, there was no clear evidence of martensite. This should be further investigated. Slow strain rate (SSR) testing was successfully performed on miniature compact tension (CT) specimens in air and under CP to evaluate the fracture mechanical properties of the dissimilar interface, with respect to material combination and environment. Generally, samples without a Ni-interlayer tested in air showed the highest fracture toughness values, followed by samples with a Ni-interlayer tested in both air and under CP. The lowest fracture toughness values were obtained for samples without a Ni-interlayer tested under CP. Samples with a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 7 % in the presence of hydrogen. The minute effect of hydrogen is attributed to the samples failing mainly in the softer Ni-interlayer close to the BM, which has low susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Samples without a Ni-interlayer showed an average reduction in CTOD of 77 % in the presence of hydrogen. The samples failed mainly in the decarburized BM adjacent to the interface, and along the interface. None of the samples failed in the previously suspected crack susceptible region in the clad. Future work should focus on determining the mechanisms behind cracking in the clad by physical weld simulations combined with fracture mechanical testing, and numerical weld simulations to assess any residual stresses...|$|E
40|$|Ambitions in {{exploration}} {{of oil and}} gas fields at deeper water depth require continuous investigation and maintenance. The transportation pipelines laid in deep waters are both subjected to corrosion and buckling due to environmental phenomena. They may also often undergo branching (namely hot tapping) to redirect (or add to) the transportation paths. Mechanical joints and welding are both considered as available alternatives when sectioning and replacement of the pipes at shallow waters is necessary, yet, welding is more promising for deep waters where remote operation is central. Fusion welding on the other hand comprises several technological detractions for sound operations under high ambient pressures disregarding its low cost and flexibility. The foremost detracting phenomenon in the arc welding is called ‘arc root constriction’, which is defined as arc geometry shrinkage under the increased pressure. Consequently, the power delivery to the weld pool at different pressure levels is a major worry. Effects of ionization and dissociation energies of different gases and mixtures, partial pressure of environmental gases including hydrogen and oxygen, gasification and degasification of the weld metal, inclusions that affect the phase transformation, absorption and desorption kinetics, oxidation and deoxidation reactions and many more are the phenomena that can possibly be altered by the gas type and ambient pressure level. Spattering and fume generation is a problematic issue since the arc is rather unstable under high pressure. Thus, seeking the effect of different chamber gas mixtures on welding parameters, final microstructure and mechanical properties is the main objective of this work. Statistical analysis of the collected voltage and current waveforms is carried out to identify the source of arc misbehavior and instability (discussed in Paper I). The stochastic parameters is related to the electrical stability and resolved into a number of varying welding parameters. The datasets are representing the effects of using pure argon under 14 incrementally increased pressure levels. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is used to characterize the frequency domain of the waveforms. Auto-correlation Function (AF) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) were calculated assuming the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Considering the AF, it is possible to visualize the deteriorating stability of the arc. The rate of stability degradation is quite gentle after 20 bar, though, huge differences were observed from 1 to 20 bar. The characteristic frequencies of 100 - 150 Hz and 350 - 400 Hz were observed. The first range can be associated with the mass transfer or molten droplet launch frequency and the latter range is representative of the rectified mains. The spread of large low-frequency peaks at higher pressures is illustrating the mass transfer deterioration. The aforementioned peaks were found above 125 bar where the range of the characteristic frequency peaks in voltage and current waveforms started to deviate. The calculated arc power is higher at high-pressure range while the weld bead geometry was barely varied. It implies that the arc efficiency factor decreases at high pressures. The heat source dimensions and heat efficiency factor are two major inputs for finite element (FE) simulations of the weld. However, a systematic classification of these factors was hardly available prior to this work. Additionally, to the best of author’s knowledge, the direct high-speed observation of the arc inside the <b>hyperbaric</b> <b>welding</b> chamber has not been investigated in detail by far due to several technological issues. The varying bead-on-plate welds including the end crater appearance can possibly be good candidates to categorize the FE heat source dimensions. Double-ellipsoidal heat source (Goldak’s Model) was implemented in WeldSimS® FE code that is used in this study. Since the model incorporates two superimposed reference heat sources, the amount of dissipated heat from each source should be differentiated. An intermediate heat source model was employed for this purpose. The latter model is after Myhr and Grong that is called distributed point heat sources. This model can be accurately fit to the weld cross section geometry if calibrated accurately. The calibrated parameters were found to be very close to the ones required by Double-ellipsoidal heat source model. By using this approach, not only the effect of welding parameters on weld bead geometry can be categorized, but also the spent time for double-ellipsoidal heat source adjustments will be cut by 90 %. A Gaussian heat source was also employed for welding thermal cycle simulations. Accompanying experiments suggested that the thermal gradients hardly change as pressure elevates. However, {{it was found that the}} increased pressure level might not necessarily result in higher or lower cooling rates despite the geometrical changes. In a parallel investigation, the metallurgical effect of different shielding environments on phase transformation and mechanical properties of the bead-onplate weld samples was studies. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) techniques were used to identify the effect of five different shielding environments on the phase transformation. Argon and Helium chamber gases offer the conditions that facilitate the highest amount of acicular ferrite transformation, yet, they show some differences in a number of crystallographic details. CO 2 gas provided conditions for a lot of porosity in addition to the dominant polygonal ferrite/bainite transformation. He+½CO 2 mixture resulted in bainite transformation that was found to follow the maximum heat flow direction in terms of crystallographic orientations. Very small sized tensile and single-edged notch bending (SENB) samples were machined from the weld metal material. The tests revealed that the best mechanical properties are associated with the He chamber gas and the poorest properties were presented by the samples welded in He+½CO 2 shielding environment. It was also observed that there is a good correlation between the acquired acoustic signals and the fracture properties of the weld sample...|$|E
