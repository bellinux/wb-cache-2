500|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the most}} superficial layer of skin, a squamous epithelium with several strata: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. [...] Nourishment is provided to these layers by diffusion from the dermis, since the epidermis is without direct blood supply. [...] The epidermis contains four cell types: keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Of these, keratinocytes are the major component, constituting roughly 95 percent of the epidermis. [...] This stratified squamous epithelium is maintained by cell division within the stratum basale, in which differentiating cells slowly displace outwards through the stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum, where cells are continually shed from the surface. [...] In normal skin, the rate of production equals the rate of loss; about two weeks are needed for a cell to migrate from the basal cell layer {{to the top of}} the <b>granular</b> <b>cell</b> layer, and an additional two weeks to cross the stratum corneum.|$|E

No <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were observed with the scanning electron microscope. In alternate semithin and ultrathin sections <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were found either singly or in small groups in the ciliated parts of the epithelium, and in relatively large clusters of between at least five and sixteen cells in the unciliated flat regions including the primary bronchus around the orifices of the lateroventral bronchi, and {{the roots of the}} medioventral, mediodorsal and lateroventral bronchi. Within the clusters the <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were frequently separated by attenuated profiles of highly electron-dense cells with microvilli.

40|$|Recent {{results from}} {{high-resolution}} solar granulation observations indicate {{the existence of}} a population of small <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> that are smaller than 600 km in diameter. These small convective cells strongly contribute to the total area of granules and are located in the intergranular lanes, where they form clusters and chains.

We developed an automated image-segmentation algorithm specifically adapted to high-resolution simulations to identify granules. The resulting segmentation masks were applied to physical quantities, such as intensity and vertical velocity profiles, provided by the simulation.

The simulation profiles demonstrate a different nature for small <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> because they exhibit on average lower intensities, lower horizontal velocities, and are located deeper inside of convective layers than regular granules.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{permeability}} of fluorescent oligonucleotides in cultured human epidermal keratinocyte monolayers and keratinocytes grown in a 3 -dimensional skin model. Oligonucleotide permeability in living cells {{was determined by}} confocal microscopy after either simple addition to the culture medium or topical application via oligonucleotide-saturated filters placed atop the artificial skin. In cultured monolayers, few keratinocytes (9 %) were found to acquire intracellular oligonucleotides that were primarily localized to the nucleus. In contrast, keratinocytes grown in an artificial, 3 -dimensional skin matrix acquired extensive oligonucleotide permeability as differentiation progressed. About 95 % of the <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> showed nuclear accumulation of oligonucleotides. About 70 % of the oligonucleotide-permeable <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were viable as verified by a mitochondria-specific, potential-sensitive dye, tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester.

40|$|Abstract. Fowl glioma-inducing virus (FGV), which {{belongs to}} {{subgroup}} A of avian leukosis virus (ALV), shows tumorigenicity and pathogenicity, {{mainly in the}} nervous system, and causes astrocytoma and perineurioma. Apart from these neoplasms, cerebellar anomaly was found in chickens infected with FGV in ovo. The study reported here describes the morphologic characteristics of the affected cerebellum. Specific-pathogen-free chickens (C/O) were inoculated with FGV through the yolk sac on the 7 th day of incubation. The cerebellar anomaly included diffuse depletion of <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> of the internal granular layer (IGL), remnants of the external granular layer (EGL), and disorganization of the Purkinje cell layer. These cerebellar changes were observed in all birds except one. In the infected embryos, the EGL was thicker and had an irregular arrangement with a thin molecular layer (ML) and IGL, compared with the control. The <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were immunohistochemically positive for ALV common antigen. Immunohistochemical analysis for vimentin revealed disarrangement and decreased number of Bergmann’s fibers. Use of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method and electron microscopy indicated that apoptotic <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were frequently observed in the EGL and ML.

The preparation of membrane sheets was substantially free of contaminants as judged by electron microscopy. The proteins of the plasma membranes from pig <b>granular</b> <b>cells</b> were examined by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} after solubilization in 2. 5 % sodium dodecylsulfate and 8 M urea. The proteins consisted mainly of 3 polypeptides of molecular weights 56, 000, 52, 000 and 50, 000 together with small amounts of polypeptides with molecular weights of 81, 000, 77, 000 and 74, 000. The composition of the plasma membrane protein was quite {{different from that of}} the fraction mainly of cells without membranes (2 major polypeptides, molecular weights 79, 000 and 68, 000) and from those of other subcellular fractions. Cholesterol (25 % of total lipids), ceramides (13 %) and fatty acids (14 %) were the major neutral lipids in the plasma membranes. Glucosylceramides (11 %), sphingomyelin (9 %) and phosphatidylcholine (8 %) were the major polar lipids. The plasma membranes contained proportionally twice as much sphingomyelin and much less hydrocarbon than the lipids from whole <b>granular</b> <b>cells.</b> The specific activities of the putative plasma membrane enzymes amino acid- 2 -naphthylamidase and phosphodiesterase were not increased relative to the homogenate.
