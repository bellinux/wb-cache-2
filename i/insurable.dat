25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of <b>insurable</b> interest, critics say you should not be able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E
25|$|Accidental loss: The {{event that}} {{constitutes}} the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, {{or at least}} outside {{the control of the}} beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, {{in the sense that it}} results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered <b>insurable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{involves}} pooling {{funds from}} many insured entities (known as exposures) {{to pay for}} the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an <b>insurable</b> risk, the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a financial intermediary is a commercial enterprise and {{a major part of the}} financial services industry, but individual entities can also self-insure through saving money for possible future losses.|$|E
25|$|Insurance is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, {{which is similar to}} calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an <b>insurable</b> interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E
25|$|Personal {{income tax}} was lowered from 20% to 17.5% in 2012 and applied on income {{of less than}} BDS$30,000 with a rate of 35% apply on income over BDS$30,000 and {{individuals}} who are both resident and domiciled in Barbados are taxed on their worldwide income. Generally, persons paying salaries or wages or other emoluments must withhold tax from remuneration paid to employees (PAYE). Every individual {{between the ages of}} 16 and 65, who is employed in Barbados must be insured under the National Insurance and Social Security Act and contributions are determined as a percentage of <b>insurable</b> earnings up to a maximum of $4,090 per month or $944 per week up to 13.5% (6.5% from employee and 6.5% from employer).|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise <b>insurable</b> losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.|$|E
25|$|Limited risk of catastrophically large losses: <b>Insurable</b> {{losses are}} ideally {{independent}} and non-catastrophic, {{meaning that the}} losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the United States, flood risk is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, {{it is possible to}} find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Insurable</b> {{interest}} – {{the insured}} typically must directly {{suffer from the}} loss. [...] <b>Insurable</b> interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved. [...] The concept requires that the insured have a [...] "stake" [...] in the loss or damage to the life or property insured. [...] What that [...] "stake" [...] is {{will be determined by}} the kind of insurance involved {{and the nature of the}} property ownership or relationship between the persons. [...] The requirement of an <b>insurable</b> interest is what distinguishes insurance from gambling.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Insurable</b> {{damage caused}} by the fire was {{estimated}} at over C$700 million.

Way, head of Swiss Re's sustainable development for the Americas.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, {{seagoing}} pilots became retrospectively <b>insurable,</b> {{and gained}} full social security {{as members of}} the Non-Manual Workers Insurance Institute. That same year, a special regulation came into force for District Master Chimney Sweeps, making them fully <b>insurable</b> under the Craftsman's Insurance Scheme. An increase was made in tax-free allowances for children, which enabled 1,000,000 families to claim an allowance for the second child, compared to 300,000 families previously. The Second Modification and Supplementation Law (1970) increased the allowance for the third child from DM 50 to DM 60, raised the income-limit for the second child allowance from DM 7,800 to DM 13,200; subsequently increased to DM 15,000 by the third modification law (December 1971), DM 16,800 by the fourth modification law (November 1973), and to DM 18,360 by the fifth modification law (December 1973). A flexible retirement age after 62 years was introduced (1972) for invalids and handicapped persons, and social assistance was extended to those who previously had to be helped by their relatives. From 1971, special subventions were provided to enable young farmers to quit farming “and facilitate their entry into the non-agricultural pension system by means of back payments.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Builder's risk {{insurance}} insures {{against the}} risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is typically written on an [...] "all risk" [...] basis covering damage arising from any cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's or organization's <b>insurable</b> interest in materials, fixtures or equipment {{being used in the}} construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} also many differences, the most {{important}} being that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses actually suffered by the policy holder on an asset in which it holds an <b>insurable</b> interest. [...] By contrast a CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method. [...] The holder {{does not need to}} own the underlying security and does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event. The CDS can therefore be used to speculate on debt objects.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} of default the buyer of the CDS {{receives}} compensation (usually the face value of the loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan. [...] However, anyone can purchase a CDS, even buyers who do not hold the loan instrument and who have no direct <b>insurable</b> interest in the loan (these are called [...] "naked" [...] CDSs). If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.|$|E
2500|$|An entity which {{provides}} insurance {{is known as}} an insurer, insurance company, or insurance carrier. [...] A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss {{in the form of}} payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured {{in the event of a}} covered loss. [...] The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and must involve something in which the insured has an <b>insurable</b> interest established by ownership, possession, or preexisting relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The fire {{destroyed}} roughly {{one-third of}} Slave Lake; 374 properties were destroyed and 52 damaged in the town, and another 59 were destroyed and 32 damaged {{in the surrounding}} Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124, leaving 732 residents homeless. [...] The town hall was completely gutted by the fire, as was the library and radio station. [...] The hospital, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) [...] station and schools remained standing, however. [...] <b>Insurable</b> damage was estimated at C$750 million, making it the second costliest insured disaster in the country's history at the time. [...] An RCMP investigation concluded {{that the cause of}} the fire was arson; however, no arrests were made.|$|E
2500|$|Nor {{is there}} any reason why the state should not assist... {{individuals}} in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, {{as in the case of}} sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely <b>insurable</b> risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{guidelines}} {{have been}} established in many jurisdictions which establish the kinds of family relationships for which an <b>insurable</b> interest exists. The <b>insurable</b> interest of family members {{is assumed to be}} emotional as well as financial. The law allows <b>insurable</b> interest on the presumption that a personal connection makes the family member more valuable alive than dead. Thus, husbands/wives have an <b>insurable</b> interest in their spouse, and children have an <b>insurable</b> interest in their parents (and vice versa). Brothers/sisters and grandchildren/grandparents are also assumed to have an <b>insurable</b> interest in the lives of those relatives. But cousins, nieces/nephews, aunts/uncles, stepchildren/stepparents and in-laws cannot buy insurance on the lives of others related by these connections.|$|E
50|$|An <b>insurable</b> risk is a {{risk that}} meets the ideal {{criteria}} for efficient insurance. The concept of <b>insurable</b> risk underlies nearly all insurance decisions.|$|E
50|$|Thus, husbands/wives have an <b>insurable</b> {{interest}} in their spouse, and children have an <b>insurable</b> {{interest in}} their parents (and vice versa). Close relatives are assumed to have an <b>insurable</b> interest {{in the lives of}} those relatives, but more distant relatives, such as cousins and in-laws cannot buy insurance of the lives of others related by these connections.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>insurable</b> {{interest}} is established by ownership, possession, or direct relationship. For example, people have <b>insurable</b> interests {{in their own}} homes and vehicles, but not in their neighbors' homes and vehicles, and certainly not those of strangers.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of <b>insurable</b> interest on life insurance {{is that a}} person or organization can obtain an insurance policy {{on the life of}} another person if the person or organization obtaining the insurance values the life of the insured more than the amount of the policy. In this way, insurance can compensate for loss. A company may have an <b>insurable</b> interest in a President/CEO or other employee with special knowledge and skills. A creditor has an <b>insurable</b> interest {{in the life of a}} debtor, up to the amount of the loan. A person who is financially dependent on a second person has an <b>insurable</b> interest in the life of that second person.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} the policy owner is not the insured (also {{referred}} to as the celui qui vit or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an <b>insurable</b> interest in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an <b>insurable</b> interest. The <b>insurable</b> interest requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no <b>insurable</b> interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no <b>insurable</b> interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the wrongful death of the victim (Liberty National Life v. Weldon, 267 Ala.171 (1957)).|$|E
50|$|This {{is a very}} {{misunderstood}} concept. <b>Insurable</b> interest either exists when {{a policy}} is issued, or it does not. If an insured is premium financing a policy, and his direct blood relatives are named as the beneficiaries when the policy is issued, then <b>insurable</b> interest is never an issue. If an insured changes ownership of the policy {{as soon as it}} is issued, but the beneficiaries are related by blood when the policy was issued, there is no <b>insurable</b> interest issues.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Insurable</b> {{interest}} {{is no longer}} strictly an element of life insurance contracts under modern law, for example with viatication agreements and charitable donations. [...] Often there is no requirement today that the beneficiary have a proven <b>insurable</b> interest {{in the life of}} the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Insurable</b> {{interest}} exists when an {{insured person}} derives a financial or {{other kind of}} benefit from the continuous existence, without impairment or damage, of the insured object (or {{in the case of}} a person, their continued survival).
