5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> several sources {{to be related}} to the acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E

5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata {{is known}} from temperate, boreal, and alpine or arctic habitats. The fungus is {{widespread}} in Europe, including Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Scandinavia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America. In Asia, the fungus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> Korea, and in Hokkaido, northern Japan. It {{is also known}} from Greenland. A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be circumboreal.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{disorder}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> {{more than}} 100 families worldwide, though some sources cite up to 400 families, {{and it is}} inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

Less severe skin phenotypes are seen in women and people of both sexes who have a late onset of skin symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{man-made}} chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising {{the immune system}} of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues {{in many areas of}} the globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the genetic makeup of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin. A sizeable component of Scandinavian patrilineal ancestry <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> Orkney (55%) and Shetland (68%). This combination is reflected in many aspects of local life. For example, almost every place name in use {{can be traced back}} to the Vikings. The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> 18 plant species and only in the dry regions {{in the south and}} west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E

5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia {{the golden}} jackal inhabits Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Central Asia it inhabits Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In Southeast Asia it inhabits Myanmar and Thailand.
