50|$|Despite {{reports that}} it can grow up to 1.8 m in length and is the world's largest extant {{freshwater}} turtle, this maximum size and title is murky at best. Apparently the largest specimen carapace length, 129 cm, known is considered suspect and the heaviest specimen known (weighing approximately 250 kg was actually a misidentified Yangtze giant softshell turtle. A more realistic range of carapace length for this species is reportedly 70 to 100 cm {{and it is one}} of about a half-dozen <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> from three genera that reach exceptionally large sizes, i.e. in excess of 100 kg in mass.|$|E
50|$|Though not verified, a 183 kg {{alligator}} {{snapping turtle}} was found in Kansas in 1937, but the largest verifiable one is debatable. One weighed at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago was a 16-year resident giant alligator snapper weighing 113 kg, sent to the Tennessee Aquarium {{as part of a}} breeding loan in 1999, where it subsequently died. Another weighing 107 kg was housed at the Brookfield Zoo in suburban Chicago. Another large turtle reportedly weighed 135 kg. They generally do not grow quite that large. Breeding maturity is attained around 8 kg, when the length is around 33 cm, but then they continue to grow throughout life. Excluding exceptionally large specimens, adult {{alligator snapping turtle}}s generally range in carapace length from 35 to 80.8 cm and weigh from 8.4 to 80 kg. Males are typically larger than females. 88 adult alligator snapping turtles averaged 21.05 kg, 92 averaged 19.72 kg, and 249 averaged 13.5 kg. Usually very old males comprise the specimens that weigh in excess of 45 kg per most population studies. Among extant freshwater turtles, only the little-known <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> of the genera Chitra, Rafetus, and Pelochelys, native to Asia, reach comparable sizes.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{species of}} mammals and 15 {{species of birds}} were named after Swinhoe, {{including}} Swinhoe's storm-petrel, which he first described himself in 1867.

50|$|The Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> is on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} due to habitat loss, hunting for subsistence and local consumption, {{and the use of the}} carapace and bones in alternative medicine.

One study from 1995 showed what was once thought to be P. cantorii in New Guinea was actually P. bibroni, and the earlier studies of P. cantorii only described populations further to the west.|$|R
50|$|The Hoàn Kiếm turtle (Rafetus leloii) was a {{controversial}} taxon of turtle from Southeast Asia, found in Hoàn Kiếm Lake in Hanoi, Vietnam. Although some Vietnamese biologists assert that R. leloii {{is a distinct}} species from the Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> Rafetus swinhoei, {{of which there are}} only three living specimens left in the world, most authorities classify it as synonymous with the latter species. If the two taxa are to be considered distinct, R. leloii may be considered extinct.|$|R
50|$|The Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{has been}} known to inhabit the Yangtze River and Lake Tai, {{situated}} on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, in eastern China, and Gejiu, Yuanyang, Jianshui and Honghe in Yunnan Province in southern China. The last known specimen caught in the wild in China was in 1998 in the Red River between Yuanyang and Jianshui; it was then released. Only three living specimens are known, one at Dong Mo Lake Son Tay in Hanoi, Vietnam, (taxonomy questioned) and two in Suzhou zoo in China.|$|R
25|$|The main {{sections}} of the Ganges River are home to the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), and the delta {{is home to the}} saltwater crocodile (C. porosus).

5000|$|The {{placement}} of the related or conspecific Hoan Kiem turtle, Rafetus leloii, remains poorly known and controversial. Most herpetologists accept R. leloii is a junior synonym of the Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> though some Vietnamese biologists, such as Ha Dinh Duc, who first described R. leloii, and Le Tran Binh, assert R. leloii to be distinct. Le points out genetic differences, as well as differences in morphology. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, attributing differences between specimens to age, and {{pointed out that the}} genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank.

50|$|The Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is noted}} for its deep head with a pig-like snout and dorsally placed eyes. This {{critically}} endangered species holds the title of being the largest freshwater turtle in the world. It measures over 100 cm in overall length and to 70 cm in width, and can easily weigh up to 70 - 100 kg. The average size of large turtle specimens (i.e. turtles weighing over 10 kg) that could be collected in the Yangtze River per one study was 25 kg, although not all specimens were definitively identified as Rafetus. Its carapace, or shell, can grow larger than 50 cm, with the largest shell that could be found having measured 86 cm in length. However, along the curve carapace lengths of up to 106 cm have been reported {{and it is possible}} for the largest specimens (largely reported in Vietnam) to have weighed up 220 to 247.5 kg. Its head can measure over 20 cm in length and 10 cm in width. The male is generally smaller than the female and has a longer, larger tail.|$|R
50|$|Most {{authorities}} classify leloii as {{a junior}} synonym of the Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> based a study by Farkas et al. However, some Vietnamese biologists, such as Hà Đình Đức, who first described leloii, and Le Tran Binh, insist that the two turtles {{are not the same}} species. Le points out genetic differences as well as differences in morphology, re-describing the Hoan Kiem turtle as Rafetus vietnamensis. However, Farkas et al. repeated their 2003 conclusion in 2011, stating that differences between specimens may be due to age. They also pointed out that Le et al. did not adequately describe their methods for DNA sequencing, and that the genetic sequences used were never sent to GenBank. They also criticized the fact that Le et al. violated ICZN Code by renaming the species from leloii to vietnamensis on the grounds of “appropriateness”. Another genetic analysis was purportedly when the turtle was rescued and cleaned, which allegedly showed it to be female and distinct from the R. swinhoei of China and Đồng Mô, Vietnam. However, the results were not formally announced or ever published in a peer-reviewed research article, and some skepticism has been cast on the results.|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{commercial}} {{use of the}} river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze River dolphin), Chinese alligator, Yangtze <b>giant</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> and Chinese <b>giant</b> salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as {{there have been no}} confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. [...] "Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins". It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.|$|R
