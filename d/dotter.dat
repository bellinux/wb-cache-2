25|$|Jansson {{continued}} {{painting and}} {{writing for the}} rest of her life, although her contributions to the Moomin series became rare after 1970. Her first foray outside children's literature was Bildhuggarens <b>dotter</b> (Sculptor's Daughter), a semi-autobiographical book written in 1968. After that, she authored five more novels, including Sommarboken (The Summer Book) and five collections of short stories. Although she had a studio in Helsinki, she lived many summers on a small island called Klovharu, one of the Pellinki Islands near the town of Porvoo. Jansson's and Pietilä's travels and summers spent together on the Klovharu island in Pellinki have been captured on several hours of film, shot by Pietilä. Several documentaries have been made of this footage, the latest being Haru, yksinäinen saari (Haru, the lonely island) (1998) and Tove ja Tooti Euroopassa (Tove and Tooti in Europe) (2004).|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} case of transvenous removal of endocardial leads in a patient with initial {{contraindication}} for such a procedure due {{to the size of}} the vegetation in his right atrium. Simultaneously, the patient’s progressive general poor condition during the course of infective endocarditis prognosed that cardiosurgical intervention with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass would be unsuccessful.

An asymptomatic pulmonary embolism caused by defragmented vegetation was revealed after the procedure. Case report In a 78 -year-old patient, a 13 -year-old pacing system consisting of the DDD pacemaker and two bipolar passive fixation leads (Bio-tronik TiR BP and TiJ BP) was present. The patient was pacing-dependent due to complete atrioventricular block.

5000|$|The Script on Ice is {{completed}} {{with the traditional}} dotting of the [...] "i." [...] Traditionally, the [...] "Ice Dot" [...] is reserved for Sousaphone players {{who have never been}} in the Sousaphone section of the Marching Band. The rules for an Ice Dot are somewhat relaxed compared to the Marching Band rules. In the Marching Band, dotting the i is an honor reserved only to fourth and fifth year members of the Sousaphone section. Because of this, all fourth years are guaranteed one dot, but quite often they may do multiple dots their fourth and fifth years. In Athletic Band, the Ice Dot eligibility is based on seniority. Once a student dots the ice, they are no longer eligible to dot. This routinely allows for students who may only be in their second or third year of Athletic Band to have an Ice Dot. The Ice Dot tradition varies on the abilities of the individual Sousaphone player: some Sousaphone players attempt to strut, some do the traditional bow, most play the solo during the sung portion of Buckeye Battle Cry, however, all Ice <b>Dotters</b> are led to the place of honor by the Drum Major.|$|R

40|$|A new {{radiopaque}} polymeric biomaterial {{has been}} synthesized. The material, which actually represents an entire family of analogous radiopaque materials, {{is composed of}} 2 -(p-iodobenzoyl) ethyl methacrylate (21 mol%), Me methacrylate (MMA, 60 mol%), and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA, 19 mol%). The terpolymer was synthesized in a radical polymn. reaction physiochem. characterization techniques (gel permeation chromatog., 500 MHz 1 H NMR in deuterated DMSO (d 6 -DMSO) sol., DSC, dynamic water contact angle measurements), {{as well as to}} an in vitro thrombogenicity assay. Furthermore, SEM was used to study interactions of the material with blood platelets. The most important findings are: (a) the material is a genuine polymer with excellent X-ray visibility, even in the form of thin (0. 4 mm) drawn fibers. This was established under realistic conditions. (B) the material exhibits low in vitro thrombogenicity, i. e. comparable to polyvinyl chloride, which is known as a passive material. These observations lead us to the suggestion that this type of radiopaque polymer holds promise with respect to application as a construction material for a new type of endovascular stent. This could be relevant in particular to stents to be used in conjuction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), also known as <b>Dottering.</b> Currently there is a clear trend away from metallic stents towards all-polymeric stents, since the latter have superior biocompatibility. Biocompatibility of the stent material is of vital importance with respect to the long-term performance of the stent, i. e. its ability to prevent the phenomenon of restenosis. Note that both stent material- vessel wall and stent material- blood interactions are crucial. Application of a radiopaque polymer as described therein should enable us to construct a new stent type with improved biocompatibility with respect to the metallic counterpart, combined with excellent X-ray visibility.

2500|$|In 1958, Interventional Radiologist, Dr. Charles <b>Dotter</b> {{began working}} on methods to {{visualize}} the coronary anatomy via sequential radiographic films. [...] He invented a method known as occlusive aortography in an animal model. [...] Occlusive aortography involved the transient occlusion of the aorta and subsequent injection of {{a small amount of}} radiographic contrast agent into the aortic root and subsequent serial x-rays to visualize the coronary arteries. [...] This method produced impressive images of the coronary anatomy. [...] <b>Dotter</b> later reported that all the animals used in the procedure survived.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dotter</b> and Melvin Judkins had {{suggested}} using prosthetic devices inside arteries (in the leg) to maintain blood flow after dilation {{as early as}} 1964. [...] In 1986, Puel and Sigwart implanted the first coronary stent in a human patient. Several trials in the 1990s showed the superiority of stent placement over balloon angioplasty. [...] Restenosis was reduced because the stent acted as a scaffold to hold open the dilated segment of artery; acute closure of the coronary artery (and the requirement for emergency CABG) was reduced, because the stent repaired dissections of the arterial wall. [...] By 1999, stents were used in 84% of percutaneous coronary interventions (i.e., those done via a catheter, and not by open-chest surgery).|$|E

2500|$|The use of tapered Teflon dilating {{catheters}} for {{the treatment}} of atherosclerotic vascular disease was first described in 1964 by two interventional radiologists, Charles <b>Dotter</b> and Melvin Judkins, when they used it to treat a case of atherosclerotic disease in the superficial femoral artery of the left leg. [...] Building on their work and his own research involving balloon-tipped catheters, Andreas Gruentzig performed the first success percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (known as PTCA or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) on a human on September 16, 1977 at University Hospital, Zurich. [...] The results of the procedure were presented at the American Heart Association meeting two months later to a stunned audience of cardiologists. [...] In the subsequent three years, Dr. Gruentzig performed coronary angioplasties in 169 patients in Zurich, while teaching the practice of coronary angioplasty to a field of budding interventional cardiologists. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} ten years later, nearly 90 percent of these individuals were still alive.

In 1996, Kenseth made his Busch Series debut at the spring race at Lowe's Motor Speedway for Wegner, finishing 22nd after starting 30th in a car rented from Bobby <b>Dotter.</b> Kenseth was disappointed because they were unable to attract major sponsorship. [...] "It was just like 1992", Kenseth said. [...] "Plans just didn't work. I thought things would be different. Personally, I had moved and was adjusting to being a thousand miles from home." [...] At the end of the season, the Wegner/Kenseth team closed, and Kenseth found a ride for Gerry Gunderman's American Speed Association team, who was also Alan Kulwicki's last shop in Wisconsin before moving to NASCAR.
