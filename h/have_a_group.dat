The kamokim are held in high regard in all public spheres and are a common topic of conversation.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{involving}} the Main Library arose in 1999 {{when the city}} decided to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> {{of high school students}} paint a mural {{on the east side of}} the building. This sparked public outcry at the possibility that the architecturally significant building would be damaged, with some of the most vocal opposition coming from Pearl himself. Eventually a compromise was reached which involved painting the mural on removable panels. The artwork was later removed in 2005 as part of the ongoing renovations.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of musical {{software}} such as Percussion Studio, transcribing and reproducing rhythms has become easier. Tools such as this are useful for people who don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> to practice with, as individual tracks are able to be isolated or tempo changed to assist with playing along and learning/practising. A competent user is able to reproduce material learnt in a workshop for later use. Notwithstanding its utility as a basic transcription tool percussion studio cannot reproduce the intonation and microtiming of a skilled player and has limited value, therefore, for transcribing solo. The drum machine software Hydrogen (software) contains Djembe, dunun and bell sound files {{that can be used}} to study as described above.|$|E
25|$|Multiple mating is {{also seen}} in wattled jacanas where females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of males close by for mating. Copulations are easily seen in jacanas facilitating the {{observation}} of females copulating continuously with various males. The continuous copulations and the close proximity to mates have allowed the females to fly in within minutes leading to the expected sperm mixing and allowing the most viable sperm to fertilize most of the clutch or to increase genetic diversity for benefits in disease resistance. Snow and Andrade (2005) concluded that the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) increases their ability to manipulate the paternity of their offspring by using the spermathecae to store multiple sperms. Additionally, a study on leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex echinatior) supported the hypothesis that sperm mixing indeed occurs in polyandrous social insects. It was further found that the eggs in the queen ants showed to be completely mixed and used randomly during egg laying.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Quadrophenia was positive. Melody Makers Chris Welch wrote [...] "rarely <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> succeeded in distilling their essence and embracing a motif as convincingly", while Charles Shaar Murray described the album in New Musical Express as the [...] "most rewarding musical {{experience of the}} year". Reaction in the US was generally positive, though Dave Marsh, writing in Creem gave a more critical response. Lenny Kaye, writing in Rolling Stone wrote [...] "the Who as a whole have never sounded better" [...] but added [...] "on its own terms, Quadrophenia falls short of the mark". In a year-end top albums list for Newsday, Robert Christgau ranked it seventh and found it exemplary of how 1973's best records [...] "fail to reward casual attention.

500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{received}} generally {{negative comments}} from the critics, who criticised the use of Auto-Tuned vocals and said that [...] "the production was lacking, making the choice to release it is a single confusing. with] some terrible autotone ... and a trance-y backdrop that never quite reaches the places it promises." [...] Tony Falls of Virgin Media was also {{highly critical of the}} song awarding it zero out of ten. [...] "Never <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> got by with so little a contribution to music, but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress. 'Missing You' sounds like an album track. Not something you’d hear as a comeback track that would uplift your lost consciousness about the girls’ disappearance. The idea of shooting the video in Spain for this type of song is a nice choice, but Frankie is overly tanned. Please kill me. A vacuous set of reviews for a vacuous group of girls." ...|$|E

Pettit {{identified}} [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] as [...] "a plea {{on behalf}} of all minorities – not only by ethnicity, but also by race, class, gender, or sexual orientation." [...] Additionally, Pettit feels that the song [...] "might have been a jab at the homophobic religious right who were organizing a boycott of Disney." [...] A somber song, [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] also [...] "underlines the theme of Victor Hugo’s novel": [...] "At one point in the song, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of rich, well-off Christians asking God for wealth, fame, and love" [...] while [...] "Esmeralda, a penniless gypsy who confessed that she didn’t know if God was there, prays for her people and asks that they be shown mercy and love," [...] additionally [...] "pointing out that Jesus was also an outcast when he walked on this Earth, and that we’re all children of God no matter who we are or what we’ve done." [...] The scene additionally suggests [...] "a more positive view of the Church than found in Hugo's novel" [...] as it provides outcasts such as Esmeralda with both shelter and sanctuary.|$|E

Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: [...] "I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared.

2500|$|Probiotic {{treatment}} of bacterial vaginosis is the application or ingestion of bacterial species {{found in the}} healthy vagina to cure the infection of bacteria causing bacterial vaginosis. This treatment {{is based on the}} observation that 70% of healthy females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus that dominate the population of organisms in the vagina. Currently, the success of such treatment has been mixed since the use of probiotics to restore healthy populations of Lactobacillus has not been standardized. [...] Often, standard antibiotic treatment is used {{at the same time that}} probiotics are being tested. [...] In addition, some groups of women respond to treatment based upon ethnicity, age, number of sexual partners, pregnancy, and the pathogens causing bacterial vaginosis. In 2013 researchers found that administration of hydrogen peroxide producing strains, such as L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus, were able to normalize vaginal pH and rebalance vaginal flora, preventing and alleviating bacterial vaginosis.|$|E

2500|$|By this time, however, Odoacer had to {{have lost}} all hope of victory. A {{large-scale}} sortie out of Ravenna {{on the night of}} 9/10 July 491 ended in failure with the death of his commander-in-chief Livilia along with the best of his Herulian soldiers. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theoderic and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theoderic entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theoderic while they shared a meal. Theoderic had plotted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius [...] "Ad Laurentum" [...] ("At the Laurel Grove"); when this plan went astray, Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone.
