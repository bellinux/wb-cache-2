50|$|A {{species of}} Malagasy <b>chameleon,</b> <b>Furcifer</b> oustaleti, was named {{in his honor}} by François Mocquard in 1894.|$|R
50|$|The {{rhinoceros}} <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> rhinoceratus) is {{a species}} of chameleon that gets its common name from its horn-like nose which is most prominent in males. It is endemic to dry forests in Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|The panther <b>{{chameleon}}</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis) is {{a species}} of chameleon found in the eastern and northern parts of Madagascar in a tropical forest biome. Additionally, it has been introduced to Réunion and Mauritius.|$|R
5000|$|The Canopy <b>{{chameleon}}</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> willsii [...] ), {{also known}} as Wills' chameleon or incorrectly as Will's chameleon, is a species of chameleon that is endemic to Madagascar. The species was originally described by Albert Günther in 1890.|$|R
5000|$|The Malagasy giant {{chameleon}} or Oustalets's <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> oustaleti [...] ) is a {{very large}} species of chameleon which is endemic to Madagascar, but also has been introduced near Nairobi in Kenya (though its current status there is unclear).|$|R
50|$|Three {{species are}} named after Lamberton: the western red forest rat (Nesomys lambertoni) of western Madagascar, Lamberton's baboon {{tarantula}} (Monocentropus lambertoni), and the Fito leaf chameleon (Brookesia lambertoni). The taxonomic synonym for the carpet <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> lateralis), Chamaeleo lambertoni Angel, 1921, was also named after Lamberton.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} known for {{having one of the}} world's {{smallest}} frogs (Stumpffia pygmaea) and chameleon (Brookesia minima). The Lokobe Reserve is one of Madagascar's five Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales). Nosy Be is also home to a specific color of panther <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis).|$|R
5000|$|Pollen's name is commemorated in the {{specific}} epithets of the Comoros olive pigeon (Columba pollenii [...] ), the Pollen's vanga (Xenopirostris polleni [...] ), the Mayotte <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> polleni [...] ), and the Madagascar coastal skink (Madascincus polleni [...] ). He died on 7 May 1886 in The Hague, Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The native fauna of Madagascar {{are well}} represented. Ten species of {{amphibian}} and 44 reptile species are present. These include the rare Madagascan big-headed turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), the rhinoceros <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> rhinoceratus) and the dwarf chameleon (Brookesia decaryi). There are two ground-dwelling boa constrictor snakes Acrantophis madagascariensis and Sanzinia madagascariensis, and the rare terrestrial snake Liophidium therezieni.|$|R
50|$|The reptile and {{amphibian}} diversity at Marojejy is also rich, {{higher than}} any other protected area in Madagascar. A total of 148 species have been inventoried, and 17 of these are found only in Marojejy, including Brookesia karchei and Chamaeleo peyrieresi, two species of several chameleons found there. The panther <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis), leaf-tailed geckos (genus Uroplatus), and many species of frogs are also reported from this locality. Invertebrates include large millipedes, spiders, and an abundance of small leeches.|$|R
50|$|There are two subspecies, Furcifer v. verrucosus and Furcifer v. semicristatus, {{the latter}} being found mainly in the southernmost part of the island. This {{chameleon}} {{is closely related to}} Oustalet's <b>chameleon</b> <b>Furcifer</b> oustaleti (Malagasy giant chameleon), the pair forming a species complex, but each member of the group may be a cryptic species (two species indistinguishable in the field and currently believed to be a single species) and the exact taxonomical relationship between members of the group is unclear.|$|R

50|$|Mammals {{found in}} this forest include the apex {{predator}} fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the fanaloka (Fossa fossana), northern ring-tailed mongoose and numerous bat species. Lemurs occurring here include the crowned lemur, northern sportive lemur, gray mouse lemur, Sanford's brown lemur and the aye-aye. Numerous geckos inhabit the reserve including the Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko, big-headed gecko and day gecko. Other local reptiles are the Madagascar ground boa, the white-lipped <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> minor) and Oustalet's chameleon, the world's largest chameleon, which can attain 68 centimetres in length.|$|R
50|$|A {{study found}} other {{cockroaches}} (Turkestan ("red runner") cockroaches, Madagascar hissing cockroaches,) provided a high-protein, low fat nutrition composition similar to crickets, {{more so than}} mealworms or superworm larvae provide. The gut contents of the cockroach, depending on its diet, may provide essential nutrients unavailable from a cockroach with an empty gut. Vitamin and mineral content in studied cockroaches was well represented except for low calcium:phosphorus ratios typical in cockroaches, and relatively low vitamin A and E in captive cockroaches. Supplementation of these nutrients in feeder cockroaches may be advisable. A study of panther <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R
50|$|Réunion {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of birds such as the white-tailed tropicbird (paille en queue). Its largest land animal is the panther <b>chameleon,</b> <b>Furcifer</b> pardalis. Much of the West coast is ringed by coral reef which harbours, among other animals, sea urchins, conger eels and parrot fish. Sea turtles and {{dolphins}} also inhabit the coastal waters. Humpback whales migrate north to the island from the Antarctic waters annually during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June-September) to breed and feed, and can be routinely observed from the shores of Réunion during this season. At least 19 species formerly endemic to Réunion have become extinct following human colonisation.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{study of}} commercially ordered specimens, small second instar nymphs (...) {{consisted}} of 21% dry matter, made of 76% crude protein and 14% crude fat, while medium third instar nymphs (1.3-1.9 cm) consisted of 28% dry matter, made of 53% crude protein and 27% crude fat. Mineral content is well represented except for a low calcium:phosphorus ratio typical in cockroaches, and calcium supplementation may be advisable. Vitamin A and E content was relatively low, and is generally significantly higher in free-ranging cockroaches. Insectivores which fed on unsupplemented invertebrates {{have been found to}} suffer from vitamin A deficiencies, and {{a study of}} panther <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis) found vitamin A deficiency shortened life spans and reduced reproduction rates.|$|R
40|$|A wild-caught male panther <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis, {{previously}} {{known as}} Chamaleo pardalis) import-ed from Madagascar and of unknown age was present-ed to the Avian and Exotic Animal Clinic of Lafayette with a complaint of anorexia. The chameleon’s diet con-sisted primarily of crickets, which the owner occasional-ly would dust with calcium supplement. Although phys-ically vigorous, {{the patient was}} thin (52 g), exhibited poor coloration (Figure 1 A), and had pale oral mucous membranes. Physical examination revealed 4 multifocal, poorly defined small bulges underneath the skin (not shown). Two of the bulges were located behind the left forearm, and the other 2 were located cranial to the right rear limb.

40|$|Blood {{samples of}} 86 captive panther <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> pardalis) were {{collected}} in January and August from the ventral coccygeal vein {{in order to establish}} reference intervals of clinical healthy individuals under similar husbandry conditions for plasma biochemistry and hematology for this species. Significant differences were found in phosphorus, glucose, total protein, albumin and white blood cell count between males and females in both seasons. Calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase varied in only one season between genders. Significant differences between summer and winter values were present in both genders for uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total protein, creatine kinase and albumin. Additionally, females showed seasonal variations for alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, whereas packed cell volume varied in males. Gravid females had significantly higher body-weights and increased values for uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, alanine aminotransferase, total protein and albumin. Cytomorphologic characteristics of blood cells in stained blood films were evaluated to serve as additional parameters for hematology...|$|R
5000|$|In {{some areas}} of shrubby savannah {{grassland}} Furcifer campani {{is reported to be}} common but no real assessment of its abundance has been made. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being [...] "Vulnerable". This is because its habitat is being cleared for agricultural production and there is an annual cycle of burning. It shares its range with the white-lined <b>chameleon</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> lateralis) and that species seems better able to cope with the disturbance and degradation to the habitat caused by humans. It should be safe from human disturbance in the national park {{but this is not the}} case on the Ankaratra mountains. Exports of Furcifer campani peaked in 1994 when over five thousand were removed from the island. Although the export of all chameleons from Madagascar has been banned since then, some may still be being collected. The IUCN consider that steps should be taken to limit the damage done by fires to the grassland where Furcifer campani is found.|$|R

40|$|The morphometry, age structure, and {{abundance}} of the panther <b>chameleon</b> <b>Furcifer</b> pardalis (Cuvier 1829) were studied at Nosy Be (NW Madagascar). Males were larger and heavier than Females (SVL, 138. 38 +/- 35. 94 vs 91. 92 +/- 18. 48 mm; mass, 61. 06 +/- 39. 86 vs 22. 62 +/- 13. 17 g). The age, assessed by skeletochronology, was usually {{less than one}} year, with a maximum of 2 years. The density estimate for adult individuals was higher along roads (42. 21 /ha) than in agricultural habitats far from roads (17. 43 /ha). Compared to other species of Malagasy chameleons, F pardalis is infrequent in pristine and close forests, while, like other Furcifer species, it. is more closely associated with riverine habitats. The higher concentration Of individuals in forest-like bands along roads is explained {{by the presence of}} a suitable vegetation band along roads and the similarity of this habitat to the riverine and ecotonal forests preferred by chameleons of the genus Furcifer. The life history traits, high fecundity and short life span indicate that the current collecting rate does not: affect: the abundance of F pardalis. Measures of chameleon conservation at Nosy Be should consider the preservation of the anthropogenic forest band...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of disseminated granulomatous disease {{occurred in a}} group of veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus) in a zoo collection. An adult female and six offspring developed large granulomas in multiple organs and were euthanized. At necropsy, roughly spherical yellow-to-white nodules 1 to 3 mm in diameter were grossly visible in the liver and other organs. Histopathology revealed fungal elements that were spherical to ovoid in shape, fragments of slender to irregularly swollen hyphae, and occasional conidia produced on phialides. Fungal isolates were initially suspected on the basis of morphology results to represent Paecilomyces viridis, a species known only from one {{outbreak of}} fatal mycosis in carpet <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> lateralis). Data obtained from morphological studies and from phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal rRNA (rDNA) sequence data revealed the Danish chameleon isolates to be a related undescribed anamorphic species within the family Clavicipitaceae that includes many insect pathogens. Chamaeleomyces granulomatis gen. et sp. nov. is given as the name for the newly described fungus, and P. viridis is transferred to the new genus as Chamaeleomyces viridis comb. nov. Chamaeleomyces species are distinguished by having basally swollen phialides tapering to a narrow neck, conidia in fragile chains, and pale green to greenish-gray colonies. Both species are dimorphic, producing a transitory yeast stage characterized by ovoid-to-subglobose or subcylindrical yeast-like cells. Chamaeleomyces species appear to be rare but aggressive pathogens of chameleons...|$|R
50|$|Giant couas are {{approximately}} 62 cm in length (nearly double {{the size of}} Coua coquereli) and have a blue patch around their eyes, characteristic of the coua genus and similar to African turacos (Chouteau 2006A). As {{a member of the}} cuckoo family, they have a reversible third toe and resemble coucals in their method of scrambling through plant tangles for food. Observations indicate that they can climb 10 meters high from the ground(Chouteau 2006A).C. gigas subsist on seeds (Capurodendron madagascariensis and Buxus madagascariensis), insects and some small vertebrates such as <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> sp.) (Chouteau 2006A). This species of bird is often encountered in large unlogged gallery forests that lack dense shrub layers, which provides greater mobility and implies a preference for undisturbed forest with tall trees (Chouteau 2006A & 2006B; 2004). Studies indicate that in logged forests, giant coua usually glean during dry seasons and more often leap and sally during rainy seasons (Chouteau 2006A). In contrast, they have been found to do the opposite in forested areas (more often glean during rainy seasons and more often probe during dry seasons), which suggests the significant role that environment plays in foraging behavior (Chouteau 2006A; 2006B; 2004). Giant coua tend to utilize microhabitats in logged forests with a greater canopy cover, and forage in logged gallery forests with higher canopies than other areas while avoiding sites with more stems and obstacles (Chouteau 2006A; 2004).|$|R
40|$|The Malagasy giant <b>chameleons</b> (<b>Furcifer</b> oustaleti and Furcifer verrucosus) are sister {{species that}} are both broadly {{distributed}} in Madagascar, and also endemic to the island. These species are also morphologically similar and, because of this, have been frequently misidentified in the field. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} cryptic species are nested within this chameleon group, and two subspecies have been described in F. verrucosus. In this study, we utilized a phylogeographic approach to assess genetic diversification within these chameleons. This was accomplished by (1) identifying clades within each species supported by both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, (2) assessing divergence times between clades, and (3) testing for niche divergence or conservatism. We found that both F. oustaleti and F. verrucosus could be readily identified based on genetic data, and within each species, there are two well-supported clades. However, divergence times are not contemporary and spatial patterns are not congruent. Diversification within F. verrucosus occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene, and there is evidence for niche divergence between a southwestern and southeastern clade, in a region of Madagascar that shows no obvious landscape barriers to dispersal. Diversification in F. oustaleti occurred earlier in the Pliocene or Miocene, and niche conservatism is supported with two genetically distinct clades separated at the Sofia River in northwestern Madagascar. Divergence within F. verrucosus is most consistent with patterns expected from ecologically mediated speciation, whereas divergence in F. oustaleti most strongly matches the patterns expected from the riverine barrier hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The ≈ 28, 300 {{species of}} {{tetrapods}} (four-limbed vertebrates) almost exclusively have perennial life spans. Here, we report {{the discovery of}} a remarkable annual tetrapod from the arid southwest of Madagascar: the <b>chameleon</b> <b>Furcifer</b> labordi, with a posthatching life span of just 4 – 5 months. At the start of the active season (November), an age cohort of hatchlings emerges; larger juveniles or adults are not present. These hatchlings grow rapidly, reach sexual maturity in less than 2 months, and reproduce in January–February. After reproduction, senescence appears, and the active season concludes with population-wide adult death. Consequently, during the dry season, the entire population is represented by developing eggs that incubate for 8 – 9 months before synchronously hatching {{at the onset of the}} following rainy season. Remarkably, this chameleon spends more of its short annual life cycle inside the egg than outside of it. Our review of tetrapod longevity (> 1, 700 species) finds no others with such a short life span. These findings suggest that the notorious rapid death of chameleons in captivity may, for some species, actually represent the natural adult life span. Consequently, a new appraisal may be warranted concerning the viability of chameleon breeding programs, which could have special significance for species of conservation concern. Additionally, because F. labordi is closely related to other perennial species, this chameleon group may prove also to be especially well suited for comparative studies that focus on life history evolution and the ecological, genetic, and/or hormonal determinants of aging, longevity, and senescence...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, it is {{becoming}} a very popular breed of so-called dwarf chameleons (Brookesia genera, Rhampholeon and Rieppeleon), especially for their size and also very interesting look that is {{the exact opposite of}} big colorful <b>chameleons</b> (genus <b>Furcifer).</b> The most common species from these dwarfs chameleons is Rhampholeon brevicaudatus A major challenge for most breeders, however, the sex determination in these dwarf chameleons. This work aims to bring the issue of sexual dimorphism in these dwarf chameleons. Sexual dimorphism in these chameleon show to a longer and wider tail males due reproduction organs in hemipenes pockets. These hemipenes pockets are clearly visible. Among other differences identified are longer, wider and taller head of males and long bones of the limbs, as humerus and femur of males...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We used ND 4 mtDNA {{sequences}} (815 bp) {{to examine}} the relationships between <b>Furcifer</b> <b>chameleons</b> (Chamaeleonidae; Reptilia) from the Comoro Islands. High genetic divergence between F. cephalolepis from Grand Comoro and F. polleni from Mayotte is hardly compatible with the hypothesis of them being sister-taxa given the young geological age of both islands. Thus, each island was independently colonized, presumably from Madagas-car. Genetic diversity within both islands is similar, despite their very different geological ages. The degree of divergence found within a recent island like Grand Comoro may indicate that the molecular clock calibration typi-cally applied to reptiles is not appropriate for this species.

40|$|In {{polygynous}} mating systems, {{sexual selection}} can drive {{the evolution of}} male characters beneficial to winning fights for mates (intrasexual selection), for improving the mating success of males through mate choice (intersexual selection), or both. However, {{it may be difficult}} to disentangle the relative contributions of intra and intersexual selection on multiple traits that may be of dual utility. We used field arena trials to determine which morphological traits best explained male fighting ability and male mating success in 2 species of <b>chameleons</b> in Madagascar, <b>Furcifer</b> labordi and Furcifer verrucosus. In F. labordi, male fighting success was best predicted by body size and size-corrected shorter rostral appendages and male mating success was best predicted by width of the rostral appendage and body size. In F. verrucosus, we found strong intrasexual selection for increased male body size and fewer counted dorsal cones, a trait that may correspond to increased age and experience. Although females in this species are generally passive toward courting males, male mating success with potentially receptive females is highly variable. Fewer counted dorsal cones and larger size-corrected casque height best explained male mating success; traits that may be selected by the female and/or correlated with increased age and experience. Although difficult to determine the relative contributions of intra and intersexual selection on traits with dual benefits (both fighting and mate choice), we documented both types of selection on body size and secondary sexual characters in these 2 chameleon species.

40|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} the world’s top twelve “megadiversity” {{hot spots}} hosting unique and {{threatened}} flora and fauna. Parasites are a major component of biodiversity but remain largely uncharacterized in wildlife. In this study we combine microscopic and molecular assessment of hemoparasites in endemic reptile species from Madagascar. We detected three distinct parasites: the apicomplexans Hepatozoon and Sarcocystis, and filarial nematodes. The prevalence and intensity of these apicomplexans were low overall, while microfilarial infections in chameleons were relatively high. We detected mixed infections of two Hepatozoon haplotypes in Madagascarophis colubrinus, and of Hepatozoon and microfilariae in a Furcifer sp. Phylogenetic analyses of Hepatozoon showed evidence of prey-predator transmission, with identical sequences found in the snakes M. colubrinus and Ithycyphus oursi, and their prey Furcifer sp. Based on previous studies regarding the life cycle of Hepatozoon domerguei Landau, Chabaud, Michel, and Brygoo, 1970 in these hosts and due to their morphological similarity, we propose that this Hepatozoon haplotype is Hepatozoon domerguei. Future studies, including the examination of invertebrate hosts, are needed to verify this preliminary taxonomic identification. A distinct hemogregarine haplotype was found in Oplurus sp., which displayed morphologically different gametocytes, some of which were apparently inside leukocytes. The Sarcocystis identified from Tracheloptychus petersi was identical to that reported in a North African snake, indicating that the same lineage is found in geographically distinct regions. By combining morphological and genetic information, Foleyella furcata (Linstow, 1899) filarial nematodes were identified in several <b>Furcifer</b> <b>chameleons.</b> This study provides insights into the distribution, diversity and host-parasite interactions of hemoparasites in wild reptile populations from Madagascar...|$|R
