5|$|When facing {{world-class}} opponents, Gossip {{more often}} <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> their combinations. A famous example is his loss, also at New York 1889, to Mikhail Chigorin (White), who lost world championship matches to Steinitz in 1889 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|Circulation reached 9,000, then {{a sizable}} number, {{yet it was}} ill-managed and {{eventually}} <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> the economic Panic of 1837.

50|$|In 1389, Barbo {{accompanied}} de Monacis {{again on}} another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their belongings during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation by the Maggior Consiglio of Venice.|$|R
5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of the pyramid still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{consistently}} {{called for}} a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the whole}} twenty {{two years of}} Tiberius' reign, not more than fifty-two persons were accused of treason, of whom almost half escaped conviction, while the four {{innocent}} people <b>to</b> be condemned <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> the excessive zeal of the Senate, not to the Emperor's tyranny.|$|R

50|$|Hanus aldo Schimmerling (1900-1967), was a pianist, composer, teacher, musicologist, and writer, known professionally as Hanns Aldo Schimmerling, {{was born}} to Hugo Schimmerling, a dentist, and Eugenie (Jennie) Grossman in Brno, the capital of Moravia in the Czech Republic. Both parents, in their sixties, <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> the Holocaust in 1944.|$|R
5|$|Shortly afterwards, around 5 p.m., Wick's Bf 109 E-4 (Werknummer 5344 — factory number) {{was shot}} down, {{probably}} by twelve–victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron, {{though it is}} also possible that Wick <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> Pilot Officer Eric Marrs; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron may have also scored hits on Wick's aircraft; he was also shot down and killed during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} attack force moved south towards Østerport {{where the}} fortification Kastellet laid. The Swedes got {{very close to}} Nyboder and {{were in the process}} of crossing the moat, when they <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses. Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a retreat to the outskirts of the city, back to the starting position.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. One of the most striking examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E
6000|$|A {{short walk}} to a tall tree backing the village showed us, amongst twenty-five European graves, five tombs or cenotaphs of English naval officers, amongst whom two <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> mangrove-oysters, {{and the rest}} to the deadly [...] "calenture" [...] of the lower Congo.

The Hajj has also two daughters, married to Bedouin Somal.|$|R
5|$|Xiangqi (See also: List of Chinese inventions#L – Liubo): The exact {{origins of}} the Chinese chess board game known as xiangqi are ambiguous. Historian David H. Li asserts that it was first invented by Han Xin (d. 196 BC), a renowned {{military}} general of the early Han Dynasty who <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> a purge instigated by Empress Lü Zhi (d. 180 BC). Li states that it was revived under a different, camouflaged name of xiangxi by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (r. 561–578), which to this day has made the two terms synonymous and interchangeable for the same game.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> {{the regime of}} Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus {{as the last of}} the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, in his letter to Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{were aware}} that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish {{resistance}} and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their trade routes {{over the course of}} almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the Spanish advance. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> contagious diseases.|$|E
50|$|In 1389, de Monacis {{accompanied}} Barbo {{again on}} another diplomatic mission to Hungary when they <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> robbery. The two diplomats, having lost all their personal belongings during the incident, received 60 gold ducats as compensation awarded {{to them by}} the Maggior Consiglio of Venice. De Monacis returned to Hungary on another mission in 1390.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Zaparos <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> the rubber boom. As with many Amazonian peoples, they were virtually enslaved and used as cheap labor to collect rubber. As a result, their communities were heavily disrupted, and their scattered members began to intermarry with neighboring tribes. The use of the Záparo language was progressively discontinued in favor of Quechua.|$|R
50|$|Bolzan's {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant David Smith, while the remaining Skyhawks <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> Flight Lieutenant David Morgan. The fourth aircraft suffered combat damage and lost {{a large amount of}} fuel, but returned to the mainland assisted by a KC-130 tanker. A third wave, by A-4Cs of Grupo 4, arrived minutes later and struck ground targets without visible success.|$|R
5|$|The {{crossing}} of the Meuse enabled the Germans {{to break into the}} strategic depths, or undefended rear, of the Allied front and to advance to the English Channel without significant opposition. The French attempted to launch counter-attacks against the German-held bridgeheads, from 15–17 May, but the offensives <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> delay and confusion. Five days after consolidating their bridgeheads at Sedan, on 20 May, the German Army reached the Channel. The victory at Sedan achieved the operational goal of Fall Gelb and encircled the strongest Allied armies, including the British Expeditionary Force. The resulting battles destroyed the remaining French army as an effective fighting force, and expelled the British Army from the continent, leading to the defeat of France in June 1940. The battle at Sedan was instrumental in the fall of France.|$|E
5|$|When the {{campaign}} {{came to an}} end, the battalion returned to Salisbury. Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission, joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916. He was later promoted to Captain. He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division, then in the line. The sector they occupied was not very active, but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly. It {{was not long before}} Guest was wounded, and then he <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and did not respond to treatment. He was evacuated to England and after a brief period in hospital was sent to the Imperial Hydro at St Annes, where he was told {{that he would not be}} fit to return to his unit for six months.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh in 896, the Tulunid state quickly began {{crumbling}} from within, and failed to put up any serious resistance when the Abbasids moved to re-establish direct control over Syria and Egypt in 905. Tughj defected to the invading Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, and was named governor of Aleppo in return; Muhammad al-Katib himself <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> court intrigues soon after, and Tughj along with his sons Muhammad and Ubayd Allah were imprisoned in Baghdad. Tughj died in prison in 906, and the brothers were freed shortly after. The sons of Tughj participated in the palace coup that tried to depose the new caliph, al-Muqtadir (reigned 908–932), in favour of the older Ibn al-Mu'tazz in December 908. Although the attempt failed, Muhammad ibn Tughj and his brother were able to avenge themselves for their imprisonment on the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i, whom they struck down {{with the aid of}} Husayn ibn Hamdan. After the coup's failure, the three fled: Ibn Hamdan returned to his native Upper Mesopotamia and Ubayd Allah fled east to Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, while Muhammad fled to Syria.|$|E

25|$|In March 1977, Baconsky and {{his wife}} Clara <b>fell</b> <b>victims</b> <b>to</b> the 7.2 Mw Vrancea {{earthquake}} which devastated Bucharest. At the time, Baconsky was preparing for a new trip abroad: complying with Communist Romania's restrictions {{on the use of}} passports, he had just asked authorities to release the document, and was carrying it on his person. His last volumes, Biserica neagră and Corabia lui Sebastian ("Sebastian's Ship"), remained unpublished.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Nani {{began the}} new season by putting in {{a man of the}} match {{performance}} and scoring twice against derby rivals Manchester City in the 2011 Community Shield, including a 94th-minute winner, as United came from two goals down to win 3–2 on 7 August 2011. He scored his first league goal of the 2011–12 season by netting United's fifth goal in an 8–2 victory over Arsenal on 28 August. Nani made his 100th Premier League appearance on 18 September as he scored in a 3–1 home win over Chelsea. He scored with a long-range strike after cutting inside from the right wing. He was also awarded with the man of the match. In United's following league match at the Britannia Stadium, Nani scored his third goal of the season in a 1–1 draw with Stoke City. He played a neat one-two with Darren Fletcher before making his way through Stoke's defence and firing a low shot inside the left post. Nani started the match against Manchester City where they <b>fell</b> <b>victim</b> <b>to</b> a 1–6 beating at home to their neighbours. On 1 November, Nani was shortlisted for the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or.|$|E
