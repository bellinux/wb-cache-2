5|$|In 1098, Edgar of Scotland {{signed a}} treaty with Magnus that settled {{much of the}} {{boundary}} between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to the Hebrides and Kintyre.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, {{three members}} of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, {{investigated}} <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Schukala pegged the Globe reefs {{which was}} over 200 metres long, {{with a maximum}} depth of 20 metres. Each man {{registered}} <b>his</b> own <b>claim</b> in Bulawayo in May 1894, {{but none of them}} had capital to exploit <b>his</b> <b>claim.</b> Legend says that Joseph Schukala once tried to sell <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> for a case of whisky.|$|R
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{sued for}} an order compelling the liquidator to admit and rank <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> for payment. The plaintiff maintained that, because the debentures were negotiable instruments, <b>his</b> <b>claim,</b> {{unlike that of}} his brother, was not subject to set-off.|$|R

5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Some have called <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> of poverty into question, because, among other things, {{he was able to}} purchase a new car when he was 18 years old.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav {{fell ill}} in early 1660 and died on 23 February of that year. With his death, {{one of the}} major {{obstacles}} to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliwa was signed on 23 April. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Left Alliance's loss of seats, its {{chairman}} Paavo Arhinmäki was still reasonably {{satisfied with the}} party's performance in the election, due to <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> that the media had concentrated on the four major parties during the campaign. However, Arhinmäki got the most personal votes in his electoral district of Helsinki. The Left Alliance's support was highest in Lapland with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in Southern Savonia with 2.2%.|$|E
50|$|The famous {{scholar and}} topographer John O'Donovan claimed descent from Donal II's unnamed sons, first <b>claiming</b> <b>his</b> {{ancestor}} Edmund was the eldest son, and after some {{twenty years of}} research {{without being able to}} prove <b>his</b> <b>claim,</b> revised <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to naming <b>his</b> ancestor Edmund as the youngest son of Donal II.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E
5|$|In a trial {{over which}} Andros presided, Carteret was acquitted {{by a jury}} on all charges. Carteret {{returned}} to New Jersey, but injuries he sustained in the arrest affected his health, and he died in 1682. In {{the aftermath of the}} incident the Duke of York surrendered <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to East Jersey to the Carterets. Andros acquired in 1683, from the widow of Carteret, for £200, the Patent to the Lordship of Alderney.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two months of 1944, Hartmann claimed over 50 Soviet aircraft. This {{included}} 25 in January. On 26 February 1944 he claimed 10 fighters shot down, all of them Soviet-flown P-39s. Hartmann continued scoring at an even greater pace. His spectacular rate of success raised a few eyebrows even in the Luftwaffe High Command; <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> were double and triple-checked, and his performance closely monitored by an observer flying in his formation. On 2 March, he reached 202.|$|E
5000|$|Jordan found <b>his</b> <b>claim,</b> that {{he could}} solve a Rubik's cube in under 3 minutes, {{challenged}} by Mike, whereupon {{failed to do so}} and stated <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> had been made under pressure. He then faced scrutiny over his credibility, with Mike opining that his partner [...] "brings the real value to this", before he finally noted that Companies House did not list Jordan as a co-owner of a company he mentioned in his business plans despite <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to the contrary.|$|R
50|$|In 1844, Pierre Parrant lost <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> at Fountain Cave and {{was forced}} to vacate the land where he had become so successful. However, it is not clear exactly why he was forced to give up <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> at Fountain Cave. Some sources {{indicate}} that he was involved in a border dispute with a neighbor; while other sources say he was forced to sell <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> because of mounting debts. In either case it is clear that Pierre Parrant's golden age had come and gone.|$|R

5|$|On {{his return}} to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking {{compensation}} for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their neglect of his repeated requests for help. Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Wilde, a {{critical}} study by Arthur Ransome {{was published in}} 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trials of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with Robbie Ross for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost after a reading of De Profundis refuted <b>his</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|E
5|$|Philip II was {{twenty-four years}} old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to {{convince}} the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to Amphipolis. He was also able to make peace with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.|$|E

5|$|Scandal erupted when Teller (and his {{associate}} Lowell Wood) {{were accused}} of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error. <b>His</b> <b>claims</b> led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers.|$|E
5|$|The French {{zoologist}} Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{showed in}} 1818 in his theorie d'analogue ("theory of homologues") that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier's embranchements, such as vertebrates and molluscs, <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated {{the principle of}} connections, namely that {{what is important is}} the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies toured India at {{the start}} of the 2002–03 season and Kartik had a chance to press <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> for Test {{selection}} in two tour matches against the visitors. However, he had little impact, taking 2/92 for the Board president's XI and 0/117 for Railways against the Caribbean tourists, although he scored 72 with the bat in the latter match. He then took a total of 2/135 as Railways, the reigning Ranji Trophy holders, defeated the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. With these lean returns, Kartik was overlooked for the Tests.|$|E
50|$|In 1360, the Treaty of Bretigny between King John II of France and Edward III of England gave {{control of}} Ponthieu (along with Gascony and Calais) {{over to the}} English, in {{exchange}} for Edward relinquishing <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to the French throne. Edward took the land but still refused to surrender <b>his</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 10 October 1359, Hugh IV of Cyprus died. He was {{succeeded by}} his second son Peter I of Cyprus. According to Leontios Makhairas, Peter had been co-ruler {{of his father}} since 24 November 1358. Hugh of Lusignan contested the succession, {{considering}} <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> to be superior due to being heir to his father, the eldest son of Hugh IV. <b>His</b> <b>claim</b> was rejected but Peter offered him an annual pension of 50,000 Bezants. Not content, Hugh sought support by Pope Innocent VI in 1359. He got no effective assistance in furthering <b>his</b> <b>claim</b> but was named a Senator of Rome in 1360.|$|R

5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. <b>His</b> <b>claims</b> are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Church had been {{restored}} only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned <b>his</b> <b>claims</b> to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.|$|E
5|$|Wasp and Henry sailed from New York on June 21, 1822, and {{remained}} together {{as far as}} the Falkland Islands. They then separated, Wasp travelling east in search of sealing grounds. Morrell's account of the next few months of the voyage, in Antarctic and subantarctic waters, is controversial. <b>His</b> <b>claims</b> of distances, latitudes and discoveries have been challenged as inaccurate or impossible, giving substance to his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth, and leading to much criticism by later writers.|$|E
