5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based on growth conditions. In most actively growing adherent cells, NEDD9 migrates as a doublet of 115 and 105 kDa. Serine/threonine hyper-phosphorylated p115 NEDD9 {{is more common in}} G2/M phase cells, suggesting these modifications are associated with increased localization to centrosome and mitotic spindle. One study indicated the conversion of p115 into p105 <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E

5|$|Kip {{manages to}} learn the code but is {{seemingly}} too late. Planet B shuts down, with the virtual world slowly being destroyed. However, they discover the reset button and attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that he too is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> and the button is pressed, resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|Sthiti (the {{duration}} of the karmic bond) – The karmic bond remains latent and bound to the consciousness up to the time it <b>is</b> <b>activated.</b> Although latent karma {{does not affect the}} soul directly, its existence limits the spiritual growth of the soul. Jain texts provide the minimum and the maximum duration for which such karma is bound before it matures.|$|E
5000|$|... 577th Artillery Regiment <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in 1951. Tank Regiment <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in September 1951 and renamed as 402nd Tank Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment in September 1953.|$|R
50|$|The PKC {{family of}} kinases {{consists}} of 10 isoforms, whose sensitivity to various second messengers is dictated by their domain structure. The conventional PKCs can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by calcium and diacylglycerol, two important mediators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. The novel PKCs <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> by diacylglycerol but not calcium, while the atypical PKCs <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> by neither.|$|R
50|$|In general, TRPC {{channels}} can <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by phospholipase C stimulation, {{with some}} members also activated by diacylglycerol. There is one {{at least one}} report that TRPC1 <b>is</b> also <b>activated</b> by stretching of the membrane and TRPC5 channels <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> by extracellular reduced thioredoxin.|$|R
5|$|The {{intention}} for {{the first}} few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Sega's light gun game Virtua Cop; GoldenEyes gas plant location was modelled by Karl Hilton with a predetermined path in mind. Although GoldenEye is controlled with a pad rather than a light gun, Hollis credited Virtua Cop as an influence on the developers' adoption of features such as gun reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocent characters, and an alternative aiming system that <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> upon pressing the R button of the Nintendo 64 controller.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{introduced}} in the game is the Dimension Link (D-Link), measured in a blue gauge on the interface. It is used to draw power from certain companions who the player characters meet during the game, such as Experiment 626, temporarily replacing the commands in the player's customized command deck with a pre-determined set of commands that differ with each D-Link. Once the command gauge is filled while performing a D-Link, a powerful finishing move <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> to take out enemies. Each finishing move has two levels which can render a finishing move more powerful than before, {{similar to that of}} the Command System. The D-Link can only be used when its corresponding gauge is filled completely, and can be activated by pressing right on the directional pad to access the D-Link menu, followed by selecting the chosen ally.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
50|$|V1Rs and V2Rs are {{suggested}} to <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> by distinct ligands or pheromones. The evidence that Gi and Go proteins <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> upon stimulation via different pheromones supports this.|$|R
50|$|Early in World War II {{numerous}} temporary {{buildings were}} again constructed {{to accommodate the}} rapid mobilization of men and equipment. The 2nd Battalion and two additional batteries of the 11th Coast Artillery <b>were</b> <b>activated</b> on 1 July 1939. Another battery <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> 1 August 1940, with a searchlight battery on 10 February 1941. The 242nd Coast Artillery <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> on 16 September 1940.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the 6th Air Refueling Squadron <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> {{for a brief}} time. It <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> {{again in}} 1957 and served with Strategic Air Command {{for the next ten}} years.|$|R
5|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{features}} team-based and deathmatch-based multiplayer modes {{on various}} maps. Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player {{has reached a}} predefined number of points, or the allotted time expires {{in which case the}} team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> {{in which there is no}} re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu <b>is</b> <b>activated.</b> Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the fight is not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E
50|$|In April 1971 5th Regiment <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> from 1st Independent Infantry Regiment of Gansu Provincial Military District. In May 6th Regiment <b>was</b> <b>activated.</b> By {{then the}} {{division}} {{was composed of}} 10341 personnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in 1993 as the 346th Test and Evaluation Squadron {{and performed}} operational testing and evaluation until inactivating in 1995. It <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> {{in its current}} role in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in {{the reserve}} in 1947. It {{was called to}} active duty in March 1951 for the Korean War, serving at its home station, Miami International Airport. It returned to reserve duty in December 1952, but it <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in 1954. The squadron <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> again in 1955 {{as part of a}} program to improve recruiting by spreading reserve units to smaller population centers.|$|R
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it <b>is</b> <b>activated.</b> This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} zymogen or proenzyme.|$|E
5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5000|$|The 901st Air Refueling Squadron <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi on 1 August 1958 as {{the first}} {{operational}} squadron of the 4228th Strategic Wing, which had <b>been</b> <b>activated</b> the previous month. [...] The 4228th wing had <b>been</b> <b>activated</b> as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC)'s program to disperse its Boeing B-52 Stratofortress force, making it less vulnerable to a Soviet Union first strike.|$|R
50|$|The first SRIG to <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> <b>was</b> the 2nd SRIG, in October 1988, {{under the}} command of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune. 1st SRIG <b>was</b> <b>activated</b> in October 1989 at Camp Pendleton, and 3rd SRIG in October 1990 at Camp Hansen, Okinawa.|$|R

5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine <b>is</b> <b>activated,</b> but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is eating in the fight and it falls to the ground below.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is {{passed on to the}} pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach <b>is</b> <b>activated</b> by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5000|$|The EPWS could <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> {{by local}} police, fire, and {{environmental}} agencies; by Environment Canada; and by other provincial {{and local authorities}} as required. It could <b>be</b> <b>activated</b> {{for any of the}} following reasons: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore regions within the brain that <b>are</b> <b>activated</b> during working memory tasks in males versus females.
