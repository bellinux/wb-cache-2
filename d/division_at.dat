The 920th Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade, 95th Division, also in Tulsa. The 320th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade, 95th <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Oklahoma City, and the 795th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade, 95th Division in Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1975, {{the division}}'s center was changed to Midwest City, Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Landings by the 1st Allied Airborne Army's three {{divisions}} {{began in}} the Netherlands on 17September 1944. Although allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The U.S. 82nd Airborne <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Grave required two lifts while the British 1st Airborne <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions delivered at least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment.

In preparation for their final approach march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|A second division, the 21st Panzer, {{moved into}} the area in May 1944. One of its regiments, the 125th Panzergrenadier, {{commanded}} by Colonel Hans von Luck, was billeted at Vimont just east of Caen. There was also a battalion of the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon {{to the west of}} the bridges. Colonel von Luck trained his regiment in anti-invasion operations. He also identified likely incursion points and marked out forward routes, rest and refuelling areas and anti-aircraft gun positions. The 21st Panzer Division was a new formation based on the former Afrika Korps unit, which had been destroyed in North Africa. Although equipped with an assortment of older tanks and other armoured vehicles, the division's officers were veterans and 2,000 men from the old division filled its ranks. Further afield were the 12th SS Panzer <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Lisieux and the Panzer Lehr <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Chartres, both less than a day's march from the area.|$|E

5|$|An amphibious {{landing at}} Mersing was {{originally}} planned by the Japanese to sever {{the lines of}} communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored <b>Division</b> <b>at</b> Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
