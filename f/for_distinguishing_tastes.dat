60|$|The anti-mask, {{as it may}} be called, of Bottom, and {{his company}} of actors, next {{appeared}} on the stage, and a thunder of applause received the young Earl, who had, with infinite taste and dexterity, transformed himself into the similitude of an Athenian clown; observing the Grecian costume, yet so judiciously discriminated from the dress of the higher characters, as at once to fix the character of a thick-skinned mechanic on the wearer. Touchwood, in particular, was loud in his approbation, from which the correctness of the costume must be inferred; for that honest gentleman, like many other critics, was indeed not very much <b>distinguished</b> <b>for</b> good <b>taste,</b> but had a capital memory for petty matters of fact; and, while the most impressive look or gesture of an actor might have failed to interest him, would have censured most severely the fashion of a sleeve, or the colour of a shoe-tie.|$|R

40|$|Following Kreps (1979), I {{consider}} a decision maker who is uncertain about her future taste. This uncertainty leaves {{the decision maker}} with a preference for ‡exibility: When choosing among menus containing alternatives for future choice, she weakly prefers menus with additional alternatives. Standard representations accommodating this choice pattern cannot <b>distinguish</b> <b>tastes</b> (indexed by a subjective state space) and beliefs (a probability measure over the subjective states) as di¤erent concepts. I allow choice between menus to depend on objective states. My axioms provide a representation that uniquely identi…es beliefs, provided objective states are su ¢ ciently relevant for choice. I suggest that this result could provide choice theoretic substance to the assumption, commonly made in the (incomplete) contracting literature, that contracting parties who know each others’ranking of contracts, also share beliefs about each others’future tastes {{in the face of}} unforeseen contingencies...|$|R
