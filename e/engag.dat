To explore how violence can be rendered a source of increased welfare, we develop a model of a stateless society and then introduce a specialist in violence.

An unmarried woman’s civic identity was ambiguous absent a husband who could represent her in the public sphere. For ethnic women, marriage did not guarantee access to the benefits and protections of U. S. citizenship, but, in some cases, further marginalized her from mainstream society.

The researchers interviewed 26 adult volunteers (from Australian companies) who help children with reading difficulties and examined intervention effects on the mentors as well as their motives for participating. The researchers found three significant factors that motivated corporate volunteers to engage in mentoring activities: values, un-derstanding, and enhancement. In working individually with children in need of help, the mentors recognized the significance of their mentor role (values). For successful implementation of the program, mentors needed to learn new skills and use them with the mentees (understanding). The interaction between the adult and the child facilitated growth and development for both mentor and mentee (enhancement).

The present study examines the main challenges affecting the region and offers a critical evaluation of the 2011 EU ‘Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel’. The strategy identifies the lack of governmental capacity and systemic poverty as the key challenges the region faces and rightly points to concerted action in the security and development domains as the way forward. As such, we take a generally positive view of the diagnosis and the lines of action it envisages. However, we argue that one year after its adoption, the EU’s Sahel strategy has not lived up to expectations. For all the praising about the need for comprehensiveness, the EU’s efforts in the realm of security and development remain significantly disconnected. But ultimately, it is national caveats that pose the greatest threat to a more political implementation of the Sahel strategy.

A model from {{a study on the}} metabolic control of adolescents with diabetes was modified to apply to health risk behaviors. Results: A SEM was tested and fit the data well. Lower cognitive social maturity and greater life change events significantly predicted health risk behaviors. Life events partially mediated the relationship between cognitive social matu-rity and health risk behaviors.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies on}} luxury {{consumption}} demonstrated that men spend {{large sums of}} money on luxury brands to signal their mate value to women and, thus, increase their reproductive success. Although women also spend copious amounts of money on luxuries, research focusing on women’s motives for luxury consumption is rather scarce. Relying on costly signaling and intrasexual competition theory, the goal of the current study was to test whether female intrasexual competition in a mate attraction context triggers women’s spending on luxuries. The results of the first experiment reveal that an intrasexual competition context enhances women’s preferences for attractiveness enhancing, but not for non-attractiveness related luxuries such as a smartphone. This finding indicates that women may use luxury consumption as a self-promotion strategy during within-sex competitions, as these luxuries improve their advantages against same-sex rivals for mates. A follow-up study shows that compared to women who do not consume luxuries, women who do so are perceived as more attractive, flirty, young, ambitious, sexy, and less loyal, mature and smart by other women. These results suggest that luxury consumption may provide information about a women’s willingness to <b>engag...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we {{approach}} the functioning of bureaucracy in European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) from a governance perspective that also focuses on informal patterns of interaction between the relevant bureaucratic actors. Following the governance and related network governance approaches, the interplay between formal and informal patterns of interaction can help to overcome deadlock in policy-making and to procure effective problem-solving. This perspective is applied to security sector reform (SSR) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). SSR {{is one of the}} major emerging fields of activity within the civilian crisis management dimension of ESDP, that also in the DRC became a focal point in the EU’s new security and defence policy since its inception. However, as the EU involvement in the Congolese security sector reform policies illustrates, coordination and negotiation among European actors to overcome deadlock and produce effective problem-solving is not self-evident or even desirable for all actors. In the case of the EU’s SSR policies in Congo, coordination indeed occurs between the actors that are dependent upon each other in terms of resources and have the willingness to jointly tackle the problems related to the SSR in the DRC.

In contrast to recent studies understanding Buddhist revival in Tibet {{within the framework}} of ‘China-Tibet ’ divide, this paper reveals that along with Buddhist revival and the creative strategies that Tibetan monks use to accomplish this revival, the interactions and ties between Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist circles have also been reconstructed in China’s post-reform context. The author examines how Tibetan monks preach to Han Chinese Buddhists and utilize their financial resources to resist the repressive Chinese state, and argues that it is necessary for Tibetan scholars to develop a more critically trans-regional perspective to understand Buddhist revival in contemporary Tibet. Over the past three decades, China's economic reform has brought upon different social conditions that allowed for the revival of certain religious practices suppressed during the Maoist years (MacInnis, 1996; Overmyer, 2003; Waldron, 1998). In this circumstance, Buddhism also came to be revitalized in Tibetan areas of China. Both popular beliefs and formal monasteries have been significantly revived in the post- 1980 s Tibetan society. These attracted the Tibetologists who attempted to shift their interests from classical fields to modern topics, from Tibetan exiles to Tibet itself. 1 Hence, {{as soon as they were}} permitted to enter Tibetan areas of China in the late 1980 s, Tibetan scholars made vast efforts to <b>engag...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ample {{research}} suggests that after engaging in a self-regulatory task, people become depleted {{and are more likely}} to behave in maladaptive ways by yielding to their impulses. However, yielding to impulses may not always be maladaptive. This {{research suggests}} that when people are depleted, they feel more vulnerable when encountering potential danger and are therefore more likely to engage in self-protection. Across five studies, depleted (vs. nondepleted) participants re-ported being less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as having unprotected sex (study 1) and more likely to engage in risk-reduction behaviors such as getting tested for kidney diseases and chlamydia (studies 2 and 3). Depleted individuals also preferred products that emphasize safety (studies 4 and 5). Perceived vul-nerability is shown to mediate the effect of depletion on self-protective behavior (studies 1 and 2). Together, these findings show that yielding to impulses may sometimes help attain beneficial and healthful goals. Consumers engage in self-regulation on a daily basis inthe pursuit of goals that benefit the self: they control their calorie intake, make difficult decisions that involve trade-offs, and keep to their workout routine even with a busy schedule. It is generally agreed that self-regulation, which involves overriding or altering one’s spontaneous and impulsive responses, is necessary to attain goals that are normatively viewed as beneficial, healthful, and virtuous (e. g., Baumeister and Heatherton 1996; for exception, see Rawn and Vohs 2011).

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{countries}} around the world have been engaging in efforts towards the standardization of medical care. These efforts include domestic efforts to realize standardization within individual countries, and also wider efforts towards international standardization of medical care. These efforts have cumulated in the compilation of various standardized treatment manuals, or guidelines, for the treatment of many conditions, which are now in use around the world. However, even if such guidelines are in place, their existence does not necessarily guarantee that all cancer patients will receive the same, uniform treatment. Guidelines are compiled on a scientific (medical) basis and in the context of various constraints. No matter how medically effective the treatment method that is detailed in a guideline may be considered to be, if circumstances in a country (regional or demographic) prevent that treatment from being used, it is impossible to provide treatment in accordance with the stipulated guidelines. This constraint has an immense impact on standardization and the use of guidelines. In an era where the internet spans the globe, all people have access to information about medical treatment, regardless of national borders. However, when people—whether they be patients, family members or medical practitioners—realize that for various reasons they are unable to receive or implement such treatment, this causes personal dilemmas and considerable stress.

Despite the role of these bodies as enforcers of privacy and data protection legislation, Surveillance Studies has so far offered little attention to their role in resistance. Based on a critical socio-legal examination of the Norwegian Data Inspectorate, the focus of this article is on the role of data protection authorities in resisting surveillance and threats to privacy and data protection. More specifically, the article asks what power the Norwegian Data Inspectorate has to achieve genuine resistance, and how its institutional structure affects this capability. Through a three-pronged analysis consisting of (i) institutional mapping, (ii) a typology of resistance strategies, and (iii) a review of its role in the Norwegian public debate on the EU Data Retention Directive, the article addresses the fundamental tension inherent in the Norwegian Data Inspectorate as a privacy-advocating ombudsman and an administrative body.
