5|$|The {{figure of}} Andy Lau, {{unveiled}} on April 2005, was the outlet first animatronic model that was crafted out of silicone rather than wax. Lau's animatronic heartbeat was modelled {{on a similar}} system <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> replica of Brad Pitt at Madame Tussauds Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, {{the ship}} had been {{sufficiently}} repaired to begin the conversion process, but Hitler, angered {{by the failure of}} German surface raiders at the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work. Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which could hold up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battery {{on the end of}} the east wing, supported by machine guns, to enable them to target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.|$|E

5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint effort with NASA to determine the feasibility of a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a collapsible crane was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Since the 13th century, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{the seat of the}} Bishop of Bath and Wells. Its {{governing}} body, the chapter, is made up of five clerical canons (the dean, the precentor, the canon chancellor, the canon treasurer, and the archdeacon of Wells) and four lay members: the administrator (chief executive), Keeper of the Fabric, Overseer of the Estate {{and the chairman of the}} cathedral shop and catering boards. The current Bishop of Bath and Wells is Peter Hancock, who was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> service in the Cathedral on 7 June 2014. Since the retirement of dean John Clarke, the acting dean is Andrew Featherstone.|$|E

5|$|After {{the devastating}} raid of 6 July, the Germans held a {{high-level}} {{meeting on the}} site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E
5|$|Both battleships were {{relegated to}} reserve and {{auxiliary}} {{roles in the}} mid-1930s. Kilkis, which had been upgraded in the mid-1920s, became a naval artillery training facility in 1932. Limnos guns were removed and <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coastal defense battery {{on the island of}} Aegina. While they were both anchored in the Salamis Naval Base on 23 April 1941, both ships were sunk during the German invasion of Greece by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers. Kilkis was hit by bombs and went down in shallow water at her moorings; Limnos was also hit, but was able to get underway enough to be beached. The wrecks were refloated and sold for scrap in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Loomis and DuBridge {{recruited}} physicists {{for the new}} {{laboratory at}} an Applied Nuclear Physics conference at MIT in October 1940. Among those who volunteered was Rabi. His assignment was to study the magnetron, which was so secret {{that it had to}} be kept in a safe. The Radiation Laboratory scientists set their sights on producing a microwave radar set by 6 January 1941, and having a prototype <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Douglas A-20 Havoc by March. This was done; the technological obstacles were gradually overcome, and a working US microwave radar set was produced. The magnetron was further developed on both sides of the Atlantic to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150cm to 10cm, and then to 3cm. The laboratory went on to develop air-to-surface radar to detect submarines, the SCR-584 radar for fire control, and LORAN, a long-range radio navigation system. At Rabi's instigation, a branch of the Radiation Laboratory was located at Columbia, with Rabi in charge.|$|E

5|$|When Victoria {{ascended the}} throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a {{prominent}} {{position at the}} coronation, and remained at court. Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace {{as a sort of}} unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a sign of her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills, for instance. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suite of rooms far removed from Victoria's. For {{the first few years of}} Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Albert.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E
