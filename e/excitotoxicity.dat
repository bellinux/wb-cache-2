5|$|In addition, {{drugs such}} as NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as <b>excitotoxicity</b> showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials. These failures {{could be due to}} factors including faults in the trials' design or in the insufficiency of a single agent to prevent the array of injury processes involved in secondary injury.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (<b>excitotoxicity),</b> influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift of}} {{benzodiazepine}} receptors to an inverse agonist state after chronic treatment leads {{the brain to}} be more sensitive to excitatory drugs or stimuli. Excessive glutamate activity can result in <b>excitotoxicity,</b> which may result in neurodegeneration. The glutamate receptor subtype NMDA is well known for its role in causing excito-neurotoxicity. The glutamate receptor subtype AMPA is believed {{to play an important role}} in neuronal kindling as well as <b>excitotoxicity</b> during withdrawal from alcohol as well as benzodiazepines. It is highly possible that NMDA receptors are involved in the tolerance to some effects of benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|THC, as well {{as other}} cannabinoids that contain a phenol group, {{possesses}} mild antioxidant activity sufficient to protect neurons against oxidative stress, such as that produced by glutamate-induced <b>excitotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide at 75-vol% reduce ischemia-induced {{neuronal}} death induced by occlusion {{of the middle}} cerebral artery in rodents, and decrease NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx in neuronal cell cultures, a critical event involved in <b>excitotoxicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Excitotoxicity</b> is {{phenomenon}} in which glutamate receptors are inappropriately activated. It {{can be caused}} by prolonged excitatory synaptic transmission in which high levels of glutamate neurotransmitter cause excessive activation in a postsynaptic neuron that can result in the death of the postsynaptic neuron. Following brain injury (such as from ischemia), it has been found that <b>excitotoxicity</b> is a significant cause of neuronal damage. This can be understandable in the case where sudden perfusion of blood after reduced blood flow to the brain can result in excessive synaptic activity caused by the presence of increased glutamate and aspartate during the period of ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Though {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is {{commonly}} used by the nervous system in inter-neuron communication and signaling, it can be active in mechanisms leading to ischemia in the cerebrum (Iadecola 1998). The neurotoxicity of NO is based on its importance in glutamate <b>excitotoxicity,</b> as NO is generated in a calcium-dependent manner in response to glutamate mediated NMDA activation, which occurs at an elevated rate in glutamate <b>excitotoxicity.</b> Though NO facilitates increased blood flow to potentially ischemic regions of the brain, it is also capable of increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus an increased presence of NO in an ischemic area of the CNS can produce significantly toxic effects.|$|E
25|$|Since NMDA {{receptor}} overactivation is {{implicated in}} <b>excitotoxicity,</b> NMDA receptor antagonists have held much promise {{for the treatment}} of conditions that involve <b>excitotoxicity,</b> including benzodiazepine withdrawal, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. This is counterbalanced by the risk of developing Olney's lesions, which have only ever been observed in rodents, and studies have started to find agents that prevent this neurotoxicity. Most clinical trials involving NMDA receptor antagonists have failed due to unwanted side effects of the drugs; since the receptors also {{play an important role in}} normal glutamatergic neurotransmission, blocking them causes side-effects. These results have not yet been reproduced in humans, however. Mild NMDA receptor antagonists like amitriptyline have been found to be helpful in benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|A {{dysfunction}} of glutamatergic neurotransmission, manifested as neuronal <b>excitotoxicity,</b> is {{hypothesized to}} be involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Targeting the glutamatergic system, specifically NMDA receptors, offers a novel approach to treatment in view of the limited efficacy of existing drugs targeting the cholinergic system.|$|E
25|$|Reduction of the excitotoxic {{effects of}} quinolinic acid {{is the subject}} of {{on-going}} research. NMDAr antagonists have been shown to provide protection to motor neurons from <b>excitotoxicity</b> resulting from quinolinic acid production. Kynurenic acid, another product of the kynurenine pathway acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{withdrawal}} represents in part <b>excitotoxicity</b> {{to brain}} neurons. Rebound {{activity of the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis also {{plays an important role}} in the severity of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to alterations in gene expression, which results in long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
25|$|Taurine {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier {{and has been}} implicated in {{a wide array of}} {{physiological}} phenomena including inhibitory neurotransmission, long-term potentiation in the striatum/hippocampus, membrane stabilization, feedback inhibition of neutrophil/macrophage respiratory burst, adipose tissue regulation and possible prevention of obesity, calcium homeostasis, recovery from osmotic shock, protection against glutamate <b>excitotoxicity</b> and prevention of epileptic seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Excitotoxicity</b> is the {{pathological}} {{process by which}} nerve cells are damaged or killed by excessive stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated by glutamatergic storm. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause <b>excitotoxicity</b> by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. influx elicited by glutamate: role in neuronal death | url = | journal = Molecular Pharmacoloy | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 106–112 | pmid = 2568579 }} Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.|$|E
25|$|Counterintuitively, KCC2 {{has also}} been shown to colocalize at {{excitatory}} synapses. One suggested explanation for such colocalization is a potential protective role of KCC2 against <b>excitotoxicity.</b> Ion influx due to the excitatory synaptic stimulation of ion channels in the neuronal membrane causes osmotic swelling of cells as water is drawn in alongside the ions. KCC2 may help to eliminate excess ions from the cell in order to re-establish osmotic homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{stimulation}} and subsequent ionic influx through activated ion channels {{can result in}} cellular swelling as osmotically-obliged water is drawn into neurons along with ionic solutes. This phenomenon is known as <b>excitotoxicity.</b> KCC2 {{has been shown to}} be activated by cell-swelling, and may therefore play a role in eliminating excess ions following periods of high stimulation in order to maintain steady-state neuronal volume and prevent cells from bursting.|$|E
25|$|Glutamate {{can cause}} <b>excitotoxicity</b> when {{blood flow to}} the brain is interrupted, {{resulting}} in brain damage. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons causing NMDA and AMPA receptor activation more so than would normally be the case outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca2+ and Na+ entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Excitotoxicity</b> {{can occur}} from {{substances}} produced {{within the body}} (endogenous excitotoxins). Glutamate {{is a prime example}} of an excitotoxin in the brain, and it is also the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. During normal conditions, glutamate concentration can be increased up to 1mM in the synaptic cleft, which is rapidly decreased in the lapse of milliseconds. When the glutamate concentration around the synaptic cleft cannot be decreased or reaches higher levels, the neuron kills itself by a process called apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|The 5 first {{mentioned}} transmitters {{are primarily}} excitatory and can thus lead to neural apoptosis through <b>excitotoxicity</b> when expressed at large amounts. From neurodegenerative diseases, {{there is evidence}} at least for Alzheimer's disease that point to increased glial activation and amount (both glia and astrocyte) which accompanies simultaneous {{decrease in the number}} of neurons. Excess quantities of the gliotransmitter TNF, documented in the cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease, are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder, perhaps by dysregulating synaptic mechanisms which are modulated by TNF.|$|E
25|$|Neurotoxins inhibit neuron {{control over}} ion {{concentrations}} across the cell membrane, or communication between neurons across a synapse. Local pathology of neurotoxin exposure often includes neuron <b>excitotoxicity</b> or apoptosis {{but can also}} include glial cell damage. Macroscopic manifestations of neurotoxin exposure can include widespread central nervous system damage such as intellectual disability, persistent memory impairments, epilepsy, and dementia. Additionally, neurotoxin-mediated peripheral nervous system damage such as neuropathy or myopathy is common. Support has been shown {{for a number of}} treatments aimed at attenuating neurotoxin-mediated injury, such as antioxidant and antitoxin administration.|$|E
25|$|A high {{concentration}} of Ca2+ induces <b>excitotoxicity</b> which {{is believed to be}} the main mechanism behind movement disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's disease, and convulsive disorders like epilepsy. Honokiol disrupts the interfaces post synaptic density protein (PSD95) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). PSD95 and nNOS coupling to the NMDA receptor causes a conformational change responsible for the intracellular influx of Ca2+ which could in turn be a pathway for neurotoxicity. Calcium overloading can also cause damage by over-activation of calcium-stimulated enzymes. Honokiol can reduce calcium influx through inhibition of the fMLP, AlF4−, and thapsigargin G-protein pathways.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} has {{the propensity}} {{to result in}} brain damage faster {{as well as more}} severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism), due to the neurotoxic effects of the repeated rebound withdrawal effects. During the repeated alcohol free stages associated with binge drinking, a larger amount of glutamate is released than occurs during withdrawal from chronic alcohol abuse; additionally this extreme release of glutamate happens on a repeated basis in binge drinkers leading to <b>excitotoxicity.</b> The tolerance that occurs during chronic ('non-stop') drinking delays alcohol-related brain damage compared to binge drinking, which induced immediate and repeated insults to the brain.|$|E
25|$|JNK kinases are {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of insulin resistance in obese individuals as well as neurotransmitter <b>excitotoxicity</b> after ischaemic conditions. Inhibition of JNK1 ameliorates insulin resistance in certain animal models. Mice that were genetically engineered to lack a functional JNK3 gene - the major isoform in brain – display enhanced ischemic tolerance and stroke recovery. Although small-molecule JNK inhibitors are under development, none of them proved to be effective in human tests yet. Interestingly, a peptide-based JNK inhibitor (AM-111, a retro-inverse D-motif peptide from JIP1, formerly known as XG-102) is also under clinical development for sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes {{are crucial}} in {{clearance}} of neurotransmitters {{from within the}} synaptic cleft, which provides distinction between arrival of action potentials and prevents toxic build-up of certain neurotransmitters such as glutamate (<b>excitotoxicity).</b> It is also thought that glia {{play a role in}} many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, at least in vitro, astrocytes can release gliotransmitter glutamate in response to certain stimulation. Another unique type of glial cell, the oligodendrocyte precursor cells or OPCs, have very well-defined and functional synapses from at least two major groups of neurons. The only notable differences between neurons and glial cells are neurons' possession of axons and dendrites, and capacity to generate action potentials.|$|E
25|$|Extreme binge {{drinking}} {{can lead to}} brain damage faster and more severely than chronic drinking (alcoholism). The neurotoxic insults are due to very large amounts of glutamate which are released and over-stimulate the brain as a binge finishes. This results in <b>excitotoxicity,</b> a process which damages or kills neurons (brain cells). Each {{binge drinking}} episode immediately insults the brain; repeat episodes result in accumulating harm. The developing adolescent brain {{is thought to be}} particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of binge drinking, with some evidence of brain damage occurring from drinking more than 10 or 11 drinks once or twice per month. With prolonged abstinence neurogenesis occurs which can potentially reverse the damage from alcohol abuse.|$|E
25|$|Aspartic acid (aspartate) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common amino acids in the typical diet. As with {{methanol}} and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation that aspartame, in conjunction with other amino acids like glutamate, may lead to <b>excitotoxicity,</b> inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects, and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.|$|E
25|$|Lead is {{a potent}} neurotoxin whose {{toxicity}} has been recognized for at least thousands of years. Though neurotoxic effects for lead are found in both adults and young children, the developing brain is particularly susceptible to lead-induced harm, effects which can include apoptosis and <b>excitotoxicity.</b> An underlying mechanism by which lead is able to cause harm {{is its ability to}} be transported by calcium ATPase pumps across the BBB, allowing for direct contact with the fragile cells within the central nervous system. Neurotoxicity results from lead’s ability to act in a similar manner to calcium ions, as concentrated lead will lead to cellular uptake of calcium which disrupts cellular homeostasis and induces apoptosis. It is this intracellular calcium increase that activates protein kinase C (PKC), which manifests as learning deficits in children as a result of early lead exposure. In addition to inducing apoptosis, lead inhibits interneuron signaling through the disruption of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release.|$|E
25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial hemiplegic migraine type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial hemiplegic migraine type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in <b>excitotoxicity,</b> as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmentally}} ubiquitous L-alanine derivative, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) {{has long}} {{been identified as a}} neurotoxin which was first associated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism–dementia complex (ALS/PDC) in the Chamorro people of Guam. The widespread occurrence of BMAA can be attributed to cyanobacteria which produce BMAA as a result of complex reactions under nitrogen stress. Following research, <b>excitotoxicity</b> appears to be the likely mode of action for BMAA which acts as a glutamate agonist, activating AMPA and NMDA receptors and causing damage to cells even at relatively low concentrations of 10 μM. The subsequent uncontrolled influx of Ca2+ then leads to the pathophysiology described above. Further evidence of the role of BMAA as an excitotoxin is rooted in the ability of NMDA antagonists like MK801 to block the action of BMAA. More recently, evidence has been found that BMAA is misincorporated in place of L-serine in human proteins. It should be noted that a considerable portion of the research relating to the toxicity of BMAA has been conducted on rodents. A study published in 2016 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 gene (a condition which in humans is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease), found that vervets orally administered BMAA developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer's Disease including amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have correlative decreases in these pathology features.This study demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease {{as a result of a}} gene/environment interaction. While BMAA has been detected in brain tissue of deceased ALS/PDC patients, further insight is required to trace neurodegenerative pathology in humans to BMAA.|$|E
500|$|Glutamate is an {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter of {{the nervous}} system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called <b>excitotoxicity</b> which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. <b>Excitotoxicity</b> occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. Memantine {{has been shown to}} have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The combination of memantine and donepezil {{has been shown to be}} [...] "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness".|$|E
500|$|After TBI, {{abnormalities}} {{exist in}} the release of neurotransmitters, chemicals used by brain cells {{to communicate with each}} other; these abnormalities {{may play a role in}} the development of PTE. [...] TBI may lead to the excessive release of glutamate and other excitatory neurotransmitters (those that stimulate brain cells and increase the likelihood that they will fire). This excessive glutamate release can lead to <b>excitotoxicity,</b> damage to brain cells through overactivation of the biochemical receptors that bind and respond to excitatory neurotransmitters. Overactivation of [...] glutamate receptors damages neurons; for example it leads to the formation of free radicals. [...] <b>Excitotoxicity</b> is a possible factor in the development of PTE; [...] it may lead to the formation of a chronic epileptogenic focus. An epileptic focus is the part of the brain from which epileptic discharges originate.|$|E
500|$|Included in the {{cascade of}} events {{unleashed}} {{in the brain}} by concussion is impaired neurotransmission, loss of regulation of ions, deregulation of energy use and cellular metabolism, {{and a reduction in}} cerebral blood flow. Excitatory neurotransmitters, chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells, are released in excessive amounts. The resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire excessively. [...] This creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across the cell membranes of neurons (a process like <b>excitotoxicity).</b>|$|E
500|$|Scientists are {{investigating}} various avenues {{for treatment of}} spinal cord injury. Therapeutic research is focused on two main areas: neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. The former seeks to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury in the minutes to weeks following the insult, and the latter aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return. [...] Neuroprotective drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation, damage by free radicals, <b>excitotoxicity</b> (neuronal damage by excessive glutamate signaling), and apoptosis (cell suicide). Several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways like these are under investigation in human clinical trials.|$|E
500|$|In the brain, zinc {{is stored}} in {{specific}} synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can modulate neuronal excitability. It {{plays a key role}} in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However, it has been called [...] "the brain's dark horse" [...] because it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the central nervous system. Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress (e.g., by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, including complex I, complex III, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal <b>excitotoxicity,</b> and interference with intraneuronal signal transduction. L- and D-histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake. SLC30A3 is the primary zinc transporter involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis.|$|E

2500|$|This {{results in}} a major {{decrease}} in axonal sodium channels, which are necessary for action potential propagation.

2500|$|Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive {{antagonist}} at glutamatergic NMDA receptors. By binding to the NMDA receptor with {{a higher}} affinity than Mg2+ ions, memantine is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal <b>excitotoxicity.</b> The low affinity, uncompetitive nature, and rapid off-rate kinetics of memantine {{at the level of}} the NMDA receptor-channel, however, preserves the function of the receptor at synapses, as it can still be activated by physiological release of glutamate following depolarization of the presynaptic neuron. [...] The interaction of memantine with NMDA receptors plays a major role in the symptomatic improvement that the drug produces in Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no evidence as yet that the ability of memantine to protect against NMDA receptor-mediated <b>excitotoxicity</b> has a disease-modifying effect in Alzheimer's, although this has been suggested in animal models.|$|E
