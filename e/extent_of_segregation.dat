40|$|We {{report the}} effect of {{interstitial}} fluid on the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> by imaging the pile that results after bidisperse color-coded particles are poured into a silo. Segregation is sharply reduced and preferential clumping of small particles is observed when a small volume fraction of fluid V_f is added. We find that viscous forces in addition to capillary forces have an important effect on the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> s and the angle of repose θ. We show that the sharp initial change and the subsequent saturation in s and θ occurs over similar V_f. We also find that a transition back to segregation can occur when the particles are completely immersed in a fluid at low viscosities.

40|$|Granular {{materials}} may readily segregate due {{to differences}} in particle properties such as size, shape, and density. This segregation may occur in many industrial processes involving granular materials and will occur even after a material has been uniformly blended. Segregation is typically problematic in that the quality of products is usually contingent upon maintaining some measure of blend homogeneity. The present work aims to investigate the causes and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> of granular materials during flow from a hopper. Segregation data are obtained from discharge of quasi-three-dimensional wedge-shaped hoppers and fully three-dimensional cylindrical hoppers. The granular material is modeled as bidisperse, inelastic, frictional spheres via the discrete element method (DEM) employing a soft-particle contact model. Complementary experimentation in small hoppers with bidisperse, glass beads provides data for validation purposes. These small-scale experiments allow for direct comparison with the computational data on a one-to-one basis. ^ Results show the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> increases with particle diameter ratio while it decreases with increasing fines mass fraction and the ratio of hopper outlet size to particle size. Additionally, parameters such as the hopper aspect ratio and wall angle affect the shape of the segregation profile over the course of discharge. Further, the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> is observed to increase with both the particle-particle and particle-wall friction coefficients. A brief study of three different hopper fill methods shows that the initial state homogeneity has a pronounced effect on the discharge profile. ^ The DEM data also permit visualization of the internal granular flow and microstructure. Colors are assigned to each particle based on a measured quantity such as the particle velocity, residence time, or the local mass fraction [...] -a new color scheme developed in this work. Thus, the development of spatial concentration gradients during flow is observed, which provides novel insight as to how the fundamental segregation mechanisms manifest themselves in hopper geometries to yield the given discharge segregation results. Using the segregation results and flow visualizations, recommendations for reducing the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> during hopper flow from a product and process development standpoint are made. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of fluids on the angle of repose and the {{segregation}} of granular matter poured into a silo. The experiments are conducted in two regimes where: (i) the volume fraction of the fluid is small and it forms liquid bridges between particles, and (ii) the particles are completely immersed in the fluid. The data is obtained by imaging the pile formed inside a quasi-two dimensional silo through the transparent glass side walls. In the first series of experiments, the angle of repose is observed to increase sharply with the volume fraction of the fluid and then saturates at a value {{that depends on the}} size of the particles. We systematically study {{the effect of}} viscosity by using water-glycerol mixtures to vary it over at least three orders of magnitude while keeping the surface tension almost constant. Besides surface tension, the viscosity of the fluid is observed to have an effect on the angle of repose and the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation.</b> In case of bidisperse particles, segregation is observed to decrease and finally saturate depending on the size ratio of the particles and the viscosity of the fluid. The sharp initial change and the subsequent saturation in the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>segregation</b> and angle of repose occurs over similar volume fraction of the fluid. In the second series of experiments, particles are poured into a container filled with a fluid.
