5|$|Abercrombie {{also had}} the option to avoid a pitched battle, instead {{beginning}} siege operations against the French position. His force was large enough that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> fully invested the French position and fended off any arriving reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|It was as yet {{too early}} to assume 'night {{cruising}} order.' The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> cut off our return to the German Bight. There {{was only one way}} of avoiding this: to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship's company.|$|E
5|$|This kid was a {{conservative}} {{when he was}} 17 years old. An archconservative Catholic. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{been a member of}} the Curia. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above everybody else.|$|E

5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, {{who was able to}} move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to more sympathetic characters. How far <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> experimented and developed will never be known, but back in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt {{declined}} {{to run for}} re-election in 1990, despite the widely held perception that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been easily re-elected; at the time, he cited marital difficulties. Bernie Giusto, who was Goldschmidt's driver {{at the start of}} his term and later became Multnomah County Sheriff, was widely rumored to be romantically involved with Goldschmidt's wife Margie (and would later date her openly after they divorced).|$|E
5|$|In her autobiography, Rage to Survive, James recounted their meeting, {{writing that}} Wanderone neither {{confirmed}} nor denied his paternity. According to James, {{he told her}} that he did not recall the details of his life {{at the time of her}} conception well enough to know whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the father.|$|E
60|$|It was {{unfortunate that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been removed to the Kenniston farm, {{where he would}} have been nearer medical aid in case he should need it suddenly; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been taken where he would have {{received}} more tender or devoted care then he did from Mr. Simpson and his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Foster!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} breathlessly, but Foster {{thought he was}} not surprised, and sitting on the fence took out a {{cigarette}} as calmly as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> Graham's checks and must be careful.|$|R
60|$|Dave did {{not depend}} on the mails, but, as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>had</b> telegrams flashed to Crumville and to Doctor Clay, stating he had found an uncle and soon {{expected}} to meet his father and sister. Then the party of three took a Pullman train for the East.|$|R
5|$|Jennings later {{appeared}} on Millionaire in November 2014. Winning the top prize {{was the only}} way <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reclaimed the record from Rutter; however, Jennings finished with only $100,000, leaving him in second place. Jennings later {{appeared on}} the ABC prime time show 500 Questions in 2016; however, as he only lasted four questions, he was unable to add to his total.|$|E
5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ended Bodyline in two overs without needing {{to resort to}} a leg field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{returned}} to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, {{to take the}} men home. The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told Phillip Law, then-director of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), {{that he did not}} believe <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.|$|E
60|$|Stanley nodded. In truth, he {{had noticed}} something, though what <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> said.|$|R

5|$|The Fire Control Switchboard {{configured}} the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix {{and match}} the three turrets to the two GFCSs. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} typewritten {{copy of the}} speech, including King's {{handwritten notes}} on it, was discovered in 1984 {{to be in the}} hands of George Raveling, the first African-American basketball coach of the University of Iowa. In 1963, Raveling, then 26, was standing near the podium, and immediately after the oration, impulsively asked King if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> his copy of the speech. He got it.|$|E
5|$|The {{researchers}} Frank Podmore (1910), Milbourne Christopher (1970), Trevor H. Hall (1984) and Gordon Stein (1993) {{were convinced}} that Home was a fraud and have provided a source of speculation on {{the ways in which}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> duped his séance sitters.|$|E

5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's lifecycle and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was popular}} at Cambridge and enjoyed his time there. He {{took part in}} a variety of social engagements and became {{involved}} in other sports. These included fives, tennis, rugby union, golf and football. He captained Pembroke College at rugby and was close to playing for the full university side. Chapman continued to play rugby for Berkshire Wanderers until he was nearly 30 years old. Also for Pembroke, he played as goalkeeper in the football team and might have played for the university at hockey had he taken the sport seriously. In later years, he also displayed proficiency at tennis, in which critics thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reached a high standard if motivated to do so, and golf.|$|E

5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), her main rival in the election for congress. When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says is too often used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> something important {{to put on his}} college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
