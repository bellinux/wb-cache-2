40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the rate of}} Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection in <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (Ixodidae) in Yazd province of Iran. MethodsA molecular survey on <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (Ixodidae) was conducted in Yazd province during 2008 – 2009. A total of 140 <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (three genera and 7 species) were collected from randomly selected villages and were exanimate for presence of CCHFV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. ResultsCCHFV genome was found in 5. 71 % of <b>hard</b> <b>ticks.</b> All positive ticks were from Hyalomma genus. Positive ticks including: Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma marginatum, Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma detritum, Hyalomma asiaticum. We {{were not able to}} find virus in in Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor marginatus. Results exhibited that Hyalomma is the main vector in the study area. ConclusionsDue to the presence of virus in 24 provinces' out of 31, we recommend the use of acaricides and repellent to prevent disease transmission among humans.

40|$|We {{examined}} the phylogeny of ticks (Acari:Parasitiformes:Ixodida) and their closest known mite relatives (Acari:Parasitiformes:Mesostigmata and Holothyrida) using 18 S rRNA sequences. In our analyses, we included sequences from 36 taxa. Sequences for 13 <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (Family Ixodidae), 5 soft ticks (Family Argasidae), and 2 mesostigmatid mites {{were obtained from}} the GenBank database and we generated sequences for 15 <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> and 1 holothyrid mite. Ten of these tick species were endemic to Australia. Our analyses indicated that the suborder Holothyrida is more closely related to Ixodida than to Mesostigmata, the group used as outgroup in earlier molecular studies. This finding is consistent with Lehtinen 2 ̆ 7 s (1991) hypothesis that the Holothyrida rather than the Mesostigmata is the sister-group to the Ixodida. Within the <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> the genus Aponomma and thus the family Amblyomminae were paraphyletic. Taxonomic revision of these taxa is needed. The genus Amblyomma was paraphyletic without the inclusion of typical Aponomma species (Ap. latum and Ap. fimbriatum).

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies of}} the tick saliva {{transcriptome}} have revealed the profound role of salivary proteins in blood feeding. Kunitz/BPTI proteins are abundant in the salivary glands of ticks and perform multiple functions in blood feeding, such as inhibiting blood coagulation, regulating host blood supply and disrupting host angiogenesis. However, Kunitz/BPTI proteins in soft and <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> have different functions and molecular mechanisms. How these differences emerged and whether they {{are associated with the}} evolution of long-term blood feeding in <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> remain unknown. Results In this study, the evolution, expansion and expression of Kunitz/BPTI family in Ixodes scapularis were investigated. Single- and multi-domain Kunitz/BPTI proteins have similar gene structures. Single-domain proteins were classified into three groups (groups I, II and III) based on their cysteine patterns. Group I represents the ancestral branch of the Kunitz/BPTI family, and members of this group function as serine protease inhibitors. The group I domain was used as a module to create multi-domain proteins in <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> after the split between <b>hard</b> and soft <b>ticks.</b> However, groups II and III, which evolved from group I, are only present and expanded in the genus Ixodes. These lineage-specific expanded genes exhibit significantly higher expression during long-term blood feeding in Ixodes scapularis. Interestingly, functional site analysis suggested that group II proteins lost the ability to inhibit serine proteases and evolved a new function of modulating ion channels. Finally, evolutionary analyses revealed that the expansion and diversification of the Kunitz/BPTI family in the genus Ixodes were driven by positive selection. Conclusions These results suggest that the differences in the Kunitz/BPTI family between soft and <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> may be linked to the evolution of long-term blood feeding in <b>hard</b> <b>ticks.</b> In Ixodes, the lineage-specific expanded genes (Group II and III) lost the ancient function of inhibiting serine proteases and evolved new functions to adapt to long-term blood feeding. Therefore, these genes may play a profound role in the long-term blood feeding of <b>hard</b> <b>ticks.</b> Based our analysis, we propose that the six genes identified in our study may be candidate target genes for tick control. </p...|$|R

50|$|In the Americas, Ixodes scapularis is {{the most}} common vector. This <b>hard</b> <b>tick,</b> {{commonly}} known as a deer tick, is also the vector for other tick-associated illnesses, such as Lyme disease. Many species of Babesia only infect nonhuman mammalian hosts, most commonly cattle, horses, and sheep. B. microti and B. divergens are the two main pathogenic species in humans. Their reservoirs are theorized to be the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), microtus voles (Microtus spp.), and the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). These woodland species are hypothesized reservoirs because although they are known to harbor the disease, complete reservoir competence has not yet been shown.|$|E
5000|$|Langat virus (LGTV) is a virus of {{the genus}} Flavivirus. The virus was first {{isolated}} in Malaysia in 1956 from a <b>hard</b> <b>tick</b> of the Ixodes genus.

The Langat virus does not pose a significant epidemiological threat in comparison with TBEV. There are no known cases of human diseases associated with LGTV. The Malaysian strain (LGT strain TP21, {{also known as the}} Yelantsev virus) is naturally attenuated and induces neutralizing antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and protection against other TBEV complex viruses in animals.|$|E
500|$|Almost all ticks {{belong to}} one of two major families, the Ixodidae or [...] <b>hard</b> <b>ticks,</b> which are {{difficult}} to crush, and the Argasidae or soft ticks.

50|$|In Sub-Saharan Africa, {{the most}} common vectors of R. africae are two species of hard ticks, Amblyomma variegatum and Amblyomma hebraeum. Other species of Amblyomma in sub-Saharan Africa can also {{transmit}} R. africae {{and it may be}} that up to 100% of Amblyomma ticks in sub-Saharan Africa carry R. africae. Amblyomma ticks are most active from November to April. These tick species frequently feed on cattle and other livestock, but can also be found feeding on wild animals in areas where farm animals are not found. Unlike other <b>hard</b> <b>tick</b> species, which passively seek hosts, the Amblyomma hard ticks actively seek out hosts. These ticks are known to be more aggressive, and several ticks may attack at once, leading to clusters of African tick bite fever cases within groups of persons traveling or working together.|$|E
50|$|Midichloria is a genus of Gram-negative, non spore-forming bacteria, with {{bacillus}} shape around 0.45 µm {{in diameter}} and 1.2 µm in length. First described in 2004 with the temporary name IricES1, Midichloria species are symbionts of the <b>hard</b> <b>tick</b> Ixodes ricinus. They live in {{the cells of the}} ovary of the females of this tick species. These bacteria have been observed in the mitochondria of the host cells, a trait that has never been described in any other symbiont of animals. Midichloria bacteria seem to consume the mitochondria they parasitize, possibly using them as a source of energy and/or molecules to multiply. The interaction of these symbionts with their host is currently unknown, though the 100% prevalence in the females of the host tick seems to suggest a mutualistic association.|$|E
50|$|Dermacentor andersoni, {{commonly}} known as the Rocky Mountain wood tick, is a <b>hard</b> <b>tick</b> with 3 life stages including: larvae, nymph and adult. This tick is generally located in the NW United States and SW Canada along the Rocky Mountains. This tick is generally a vector for Colorado tick fever but can also be a vector for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia. During the larvae and nymph stages, the tick will not feed on humans but the adult stage will. However, the larvae and nymph forms will feed on small mammals including dogs and other wildlife. Prevention of becoming infected from the possible diseases is based on control of the vector including: wearing proper clothing when in woods/wet areas and checking oneself after returning home. The adult females can feed for up to 5-15 days, thus {{it is very important to}} remove a tick if present. Follow general tick removal tips.|$|E

50|$|Argasidae soft ticks have {{different}} lifecycles from Ixodidae hard ticks, {{and these are}} very variable between species. 1 Typically, in Ornithodoros, a larva hatches from an egg laid in the nest or resting place of the host. The larva does not feed, but directly molts into the first nymph stage. This stage feeds then molts into the next nymph stage. Feeding by soft ticks is generally completed within minutes rather than days as with hard ticks. Depending on circumstances, four or five nymph stages occur, each progressively larger. Finally, a molt produces an adult female or male. The female takes repeated blood meals that are small compared to a female <b>hard</b> <b>tick.</b> Each blood meal is converted to a small batch of eggs. The male feeds sufficiently to support its mating. The lifecycle of Argas persicus is similar, but the larva feeds on blood of its bird host, remaining attached around 7 days.|$|E
5000|$|When a <b>hard</b> <b>tick</b> pierces {{the skin}} of its host, {{initially}} little or no pain is caused. Later, during the prolonged feeding of ticks, inflammation is caused at the wound, followed by acquired immune reactions in the skin (dermal hypersensitivities types 1 and 4) to the foreign proteins in tick saliva. This defense by the host is generally effective, but {{at the cost of}} pruritus (itch) and pain at the feeding site. Infestations of ticks on domestic and wild animals can build up to very high levels. This occurs on a minor proportion of individuals in the herd whilst most individual animals have low infestations (an aggregated or overdispersed distribution). On a herd basis, the accumulated effect of this biting stress can cause loss of appetite (anorexia) and loss of blood. These two losses result in reduced feed intake and anemia; combined, they cause a lower rate of growth or of milk production compared to hosts without tick infestation. [...] The feeding of soft ticks can cause severe biting stress because of the pain whilst they feed; Ornithodoros savignyi is one notorious example.|$|E
50|$|Maclear's rat (Rattus macleari) {{was a large}} rat which {{lived on}} Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. Abundant, {{unfamiliar}} with and seemingly unafraid of humans, large numbers of the creatures emerged and foraged in all directions at night. Making querulous squeaks, the rats entered the Challenger Expedition's tents and shelters, ran over sleepers, and upset everything in the search and fight for food. Maclear's rat may {{have been responsible for}} keeping the population of the Christmas Island red crab in check, as recent numbers of the crab are greater than in the past. It is thought that black rats inadvertently introduced by the expedition infected the Maclear's rats with a disease (possibly a trypanosome), which in turn {{may have contributed to the}} species decline. The last recorded sighting was in 1903, although it is possible that Maclear's rats formed hybrids with black rats. A <b>hard</b> <b>tick,</b> Ixodes nitens, described as an ectoparasite of Maclear's rat is also thought to be extinct.Said to be related to Rattus xanthurus of Sulawesi and R. everetti of the Philippines, this species was grizzled brown above and lighter on the underside.

40|$|ITS 2 {{sequences}} {{are used}} extensively in molecular taxonomy and population genetics of arthropods {{and other animals}} yet {{little is known about}} the molecular evolution of ITS 2. We studied the secondary structure of ITS 2 in species from each of the six main lineages of <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (family Ixodidae). The ITS 2 of these ticks varied in length from 679 bp in Ixodes scapularis to 1547 bp in Aponomma concolor. Nucleotide content varied also: the ITS 2 of ticks from the Prostriata lineage (Ixodes spp.) had 46 - 49 % GC whereas ITS 2 sequences of ticks from the Metastriata lineage (all other <b>hard</b> <b>ticks)</b> had 61 - 62 % GC. Despite variation in nucleotide sequence, the secondary structure of the ITS 2 of all of these ticks apparently has five domains. Stems 1, 3, 4 and 5 of this secondary structure were obvious in all of the species studied. However, stem 2 was not always obvious despite the fact that it is flanked by highly conserved sequence motifs in the adjacent stems, stems 1 and 3. The ITS 2 of <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> has apparently evolved mostly by increases and decreases in length of the nucleotide sequences, which caused increases, and decreases in the length of stems of the secondary structure. This is most obvious when stems of the secondary structures of the Prostriata (Ixodes spp.) are compared to those of the Metastriata (all other <b>hard</b> <b>ticks).</b> Increases in the size of the ITS 2 may have been caused by replication slippage which generated large repeats, like those seen in Haemaphysalis humerosa and species from the Rhipicepalinae lineage, and the small repeats found in species from the other lineages of ticks...|$|R

40|$|Idiosyncratic markers are {{features}} of genes and genomes {{that are so}} unusual that {{it is unlikely that}} they evolved more than once in a lineage of organisms. Here we explore further the potential of idiosyncratic markers and changes to typically conserved tRNA sequences for phylogenetic inference. <b>Hard</b> <b>ticks</b> were chosen as the model group because their phylogeny has been studied extensively. Fifty-eight candidate markers from <b>hard</b> <b>ticks</b> (family Ixodidae) and 22 markers from the subfamily Rhipicephalinae sensu lato were mapped onto phylogenies of these groups. Two of the most interesting markers, {{features of}} the secondary structure of two different tRNAs, gave strong support to the hypothesis that species of the Prostriata (Ixodes spp.) are monophyletic. Previous analyses of genes and morphology did not strongly support this relationship, instead suggesting that the Prostriata is paraphyletic with respect to the Metastriata (the rest of the <b>hard</b> <b>ticks).</b> Parallel or convergent evolution was not found in the arrangements of mitochondrial genes in ticks nor were there any reversals to the ancestral arthropod character state.
