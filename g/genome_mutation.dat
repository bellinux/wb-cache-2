50|$|In general, the {{mutation}} rate in unicellular eukaryotes and bacteria is roughly 0.003 mutations per genome per cell generation.

40|$|The {{molecular}} clock of neutral mutations, which represents linear mutation fixation over generations, is theoretically explained by genetic drift in fitness-steady evolution or hitchhiking in adaptive evolution. The {{present study is}} the first experimental demonstration for the {{molecular clock}} of neutral mutations in a fitness-increasing evolutionary process. The dynamics of <b>genome</b> <b>mutation</b> fixation in the thermal adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli were evaluated in a prolonged evolution experiment in duplicated lineages. The cells from the continuously fitness-increasing evolutionary process were subjected to genome sequencing and analyzed at both the population and single-colony levels. Although the dynamics of <b>genome</b> <b>mutation</b> fixation were complicated by {{the combination of the}} stochastic appearance of adaptive mutations and clonal interference, the mutation fixation in the population was simply linear over generations. Each genome in the population accumulated 1. 6 synonymous and 3. 1 non-synonymous neutral mutations, on average, by the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate, while only a single genome in the population occasionally acquired an adaptive mutation. The neutral mutations that preexisted on the single genome hitchhiked on the domination of the adaptive mutation. The successive fixation processes of the 128 mutations demonstrated that hitchhiking and not genetic drift were responsible for the coincidence of the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate in the genome with the fixation rate of neutral mutations in the population. The molecular clock of neutral mutations to the fitness-increasing evolution suggests that the numerous neutral mutations observed in molecular phylogenetic trees may not always have been fixed in fitness-steady evolution but in adaptive evolution...|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Several {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been investigated for the description of viral dynamics in the human body: HIV- 1 infection is a particular and interesting scenario, because the virus attacks cells {{of the immune system}} that have a role in the antibody production and its high mutation rate permits to escape both the immune response and, in some cases, the drug pressure. The viral genetic evolution is intrinsically a stochastic process, eventually driven by the drug pressure, dependent on the drug combinations and concentration: in this paper the viral genotypic drug resistance onset is the main focus addressed.
