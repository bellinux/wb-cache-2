500|$|The Greeks {{could not}} {{comprehend}} {{an absence of}} slaves. Slaves exist even in the [...] "" [...] of Aristophanes' The Birds {{as well as in}} the ideal cities of Plato's Laws or Republic. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The [...] "reversed cities" [...] placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in Lysistrata or Assemblywomen, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' Amphictyons barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary [...] "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a [...] "normal" [...] society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slave are a necessity though, saying [...] "Property is part of the household,... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he provided with necessaries." [...] He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they [...] "take precedence of all the instruments." [...] This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says [...] "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," [...] showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as a bit more than common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should [...] "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster." [...] This suggests that there still is some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.|$|E

Ultimately, [...] "the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property," [...] Madison argues (Dawson 1863, p.58). Since some people owned property and others owned none, Madison felt that people would form different factions that pursued different interests. [...] "Those who hold {{and those who are}} without property have ever formed distinct interests in society," [...] he notes (Dawson 1863, p.58). Providing some examples of the distinct interests, Madison identified a landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, and [...] "many lesser interests" [...] (Dawson 1863, p.58).

We may suppose, for instance (according to the suggestion thrown out in a former chapter(304)), a limitation of the sum which any one person may acquire by gift or inheritance, to the amount sufficient to constitute a moderate independence. Under this twofold influence, society would exhibit these leading features: a well-paid and affluent body of laborers; no enormous fortunes, except what were earned and accumulated during a single lifetime; but a much larger body of persons than at present, not only exempt from the coarser toils, but with sufficient leisure, both physical and mental, from mechanical details, to cultivate freely the graces of life, and afford examples of them to the classes less favorably circumstanced for their growth. This condition of society, so greatly preferable to the present, is not only perfectly compatible with the stationary state, but, it would seem, more naturally allied with that state than with any other.|$|E

But Page 95 {{is at the end of}} a chapter?Microstructures play an important role in controlling <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> in engineering materials. It is possible to develop components with tailored <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> such as strength and stiffness by controlling microstructure evolution during the manufacturing process. When forming metallic components by imposing large deformations, mechanisms such as slip and lattice rotation drive formation of texture in the underlying polycrystalline microstructure. Such microstructural changes affect the final <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> material <b>properties</b> in the component. By carefully designing the imposed deformation, one could potentially tailor the microstructure and obtain desired property distributions. This thesis focuses on development of novel computational strategies for designing deformation processes to realize materials with desired properties. The techniques presented are an interplay of several new tools developed recently, such as reduced order modeling, graphical cross-plots, statistical learning, microstructure homogenization and multi-scale sensitivity analysis. The primary outcomes of this thesis are listed below: 1. Development of reduced-order representations and graphical methodologies for representing process-property-texture relationships. 2. Development of adaptive reduced-order optimization techniques for identification of processing paths that lead to desirable microstructure-sensitive <b>properties.</b> 3. Development <b>of</b> homogenization techniques for predicting microstructure evolution in large deformation processes. 4. Development of multi-scale sensitivity analysis of poly-crystalline material deformation for optimizing microstructure-sensitive properties during industrial forming processes. The framework for design of polycrystalline microstructures leads to increased product yield in industrial forming processes and simultaneously allows control <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> such as stiffness and strength in forged products. Multi-scale design problems leading to billions of unknowns have been solved using parallel computing techniques. The computational framework can be readily used for selecting optimal processing paths for achieving desired properties. The methodology developed is a fundamental effort at providing detailed deformation process design solutions needed for controlling <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> performance-critical hardware components in automotive, structural and aerospace applications...|$|R

60|$|The other notable element was this: {{that when}} the produce of the land began by custom to be cut up and only {{partially}} transmitted to the lord, the remainder was generally subdivided into two types of property. One the serfs enjoyed severally, in private patches, while the other they enjoyed in common, and generally {{in common with the}} lord. Thus arose the momentously important mediæval institutions of the Common Land, owned side by side with private land. It was an alternative and a refuge. The mediævals, except when they were monks, were none of them Communists; but they were all, as it were, potential Communists. It is typical of the dark and dehumanized picture now drawn of the period that our romances constantly describe a broken man as falling back on the forests and the outlaw's den, but never describe him as falling back on the common land, which was a much more common incident. Mediævalism believed in mending its broken men; and as the idea existed in the communal life for monks, it existed in the communal land for peasants. It was their great green hospital, their free and airy workhouse. A Common was not a naked and negative thing like the scrub or heath we call a Common on the edges of the suburbs. It was a reserve of wealth like a reserve of grain in a barn; it was deliberately kept back as a balance, as we talk of a balance at the bank. Now these provisions for a healthier <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> would by themselves show any man of imagination that a real moral effort had been made towards social justice; that it could not have been mere evolutionary accident that slowly turned the slave into a serf, and the serf into a peasant proprietor. But if anybody still thinks that mere blind luck, without any groping for the light, had somehow brought about the peasant condition in place of the agrarian slave estate, he has only to turn to what was happening in all the other callings and affairs of humanity. Then he will cease to doubt. For he will find the same mediæval men busy upon a social scheme which points as plainly in effect to pity and a craving for equality. And it is a system which could no more be produced by accident than one of their cathedrals could be built by an earthquake.|$|E
60|$|I {{disagree}} with the aesthetic condemnation of the modern city with its sky-scrapers and sky-signs. I mean that which laments the loss of beauty and its sacrifice to utility. It {{seems to me the}} very reverse of the truth. Years ago, when people used to say the Salvation Army doubtless had good intentions, but we must all deplore its methods, I pointed out that the very contrary is the case. Its method, the method of drums and democratic appeal, is that of the Franciscans or any other march of the Church Militant. It was precisely its aims that were dubious, with their dissenting morality and despotic finance. It is somewhat the same with things like the sky-signs in Broadway. The aesthete must not ask me to mingle my tears with his, because these things are merely useful and ugly. For I am not specially inclined to think them ugly; but I am strongly inclined to think them useless. As a matter of art for art's sake, they seem to me rather artistic. As a form of practical social work they seem to me stark stupid waste. If Mr. Bilge is rich enough to build a tower four hundred feet high and give it a crown of golden crescents and crimson stars, in order to draw attention to his manufacture of the Paradise Tooth Paste or The Seventh Heaven Cigar, I do not feel the least disposition to thank him for any serious form of social service. I have never tried the Seventh Heaven Cigar; indeed a premonition moves me towards the belief that I shall go down to the dust without trying it. I have every reason to doubt whether it does any particular good to those who smoke it, or any good to anybody except those who sell it. In short Mr. Bilge's usefulness consists in being useful to Mr. Bilge, and all the rest is illusion and sentimentalism. But because I know that Bilge is only Bilge, shall I stoop to the profanity of saying that fire is only fire? Shall I blaspheme crimson stars any more than crimson sunsets, or deny that those moons are golden any more than that this grass is green? If a child saw these coloured lights, he would dance with as much delight as at any other coloured toys; and it is the duty of every poet, and even of every critic, to dance in respectful imitation of the child. Indeed I am in a mood of so much sympathy with the fairy lights of this pantomime city, that I should be almost sorry to see social sanity and a sense of proportion return to extinguish them. I fear the day is breaking, and the broad daylight of tradition and ancient truth is coming to end all this delightful nightmare of New York at night. Peasants and priests and all sorts of practical and sensible people are coming back into power, and their stern realism may wither all these beautiful, unsubstantial, useless things. They will not believe in the Seventh Heaven Cigar, even when they see it shining as with stars in the seventh heaven. They will not be affected by advertisements, any more than the priests and peasants of the Middle Ages would have been affected by advertisements. Only a very soft-headed, sentimental, and rather servile generation of men could possibly be affected by advertisements at all. People who are a little more hard-headed, humorous, and intellectually independent, see the rather simple joke; and are not impressed by this or any other form of self-praise. Almost any other men in almost any other age would have seen the joke. If you had said to a man in the Stone Age, 'Ugg says Ugg makes the best stone hatchets,' he would have perceived a lack of detachment and disinterestedness about the testimonial. If you had said to a medieval peasant, 'Robert the Bowyer proclaims, with three blasts of a horn, that he makes good bows,' the peasant would have said, 'Well, of course he does,' and thought about something more important. It is only among people whose minds have been weakened by a sort of mesmerism that so transparent a trick as that of advertisement could ever have been tried at all. And if ever we have again, as for other reasons I cannot but hope we shall, a more democratic <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and a more agricultural basis of national life, it would seem at first sight only too likely that all this beautiful superstition will perish, and the fairyland of Broadway with all its varied rainbows fade away. For such people the Seventh Heaven Cigar, like the nineteenth-century city, will have ended in smoke. And even the smoke of it will have vanished.|$|E
