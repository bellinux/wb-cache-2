500|$|In 1995, Radiohead toured {{in support}} of their second album The Bends. Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of <b>hoping</b> <b>I</b> would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, but he later said [...] "Lucky" [...] shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: [...] "'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall." ...|$|E

[...] "Three days ago, I received an email from Gates, <b>hoping</b> <b>I</b> could make time because he and Buffett hoped I could go for a 30-minute chat before the dinner about the future we face as human beings, so I will go," [...] Li said.|$|E
2500|$|In the post-game {{press conference}} Schnellenberger said, [...] "I know one thing: {{they are a}} lot tougher than we are...I was <b>hoping</b> <b>I</b> could {{raise the level of}} {{consciousness}} on my football team (so the players) could be as physical as they could become. [...] I don't know if my remarks helped (Texas). If they did, I apologize to my team." [...] FAU's losing-streak against ranked opponents ran to five games as the Texas Longhorns beat FAU, 52–10. [...] The Owls are now 0–5 all-time against ranked opponents. [...] Mack Brown improved his record for season opening games to 10–1, including ninestraight years.|$|E
