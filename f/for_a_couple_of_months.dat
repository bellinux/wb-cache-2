5|$|In the northwest, the Fan {{fire started}} on June 25 and was {{originally}} considered {{a threat to}} the town of Gardiner, Montana, just outside the park's north entrance. It was the most successfully fought of all the 1988 fires.

5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to {{find themselves in a}} strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E

5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months,</b> so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; {{a few weeks later}} Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E

25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} at the {{beginning}} of August in 1914, the common belief was, that the war would only last <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> at most. The shipyard management did not expect to have many orders, and therefore reduced the headcount. But after a while the order intake increased; the Imperial Russian Army ordered more vessels, ship repair projects and gave various other assignments. The earlier declared ban the Emipre had laid down towards orders from Finnish companies was practically omitted.|$|E

Production on Castro Street also revitalized the Castro Theatre, whose facade was repainted and whose neon marquee was redone.

Filmmakers also intended to show a view of the San Francisco Opera House from the redesign of White's office. Filming finished March 2008.|$|E
25|$|Her novel, Spring Riot, was {{published}} in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, she thought he would like it since her play was also about a child, but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The reader who had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry.|$|E

By then, Nemțeanu's disease was interfering with his lifestyle, causing him to write in the supine position, on couches, as the only way in which he could prevent exhaustion. His friends and readers pooled their money and sent him to a sanitarium in Lausanne, where he arrived in November 1913. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>months</b> afterward, he wrote at home to his female friend, Emilia Weissbluth, keeping her informed of his health. This correspondence ended abruptly, possibly because her parents rejected his marriage proposal.|$|E
