500|$|In a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated: [...] "There {{was never}} [...] {{faith in the}} house. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as being Jewish and Irish, {{despite the fact that}} I'm English." [...] He has stated: [...] "We were Christmas tree Jews", and that he is [...] "very proud of being Jewish".|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Aside.) It only {{remains to}} pray {{for the end of}} the dinner. (Aloud.) You know what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. It makes a {{difference}} to me, and it makes some difference what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I seem to be learning a good many things this morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Feel it! Till {{it came to}} this <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{but what}} <b>I</b> had more strength. It has knocked me about till I feel all over like drinking." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{find when}} <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that, dear, {{because there}} is in it {{something}} that annoys me. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> in such matters, but I do {{hope to see you}} the happy wife of some happy man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{played with}} flags," [...] I said. (I beg {{to observe that}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can't {{do it up}} in London. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> Miss Stanbury, I am so ashamed. There {{is nothing}} that I can do. I couldn't write an article for a newspaper." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and so I {{think of}} all other human beings, as circles of thought and experience, each a little {{different}} from the others. Each human being I see as essentially a circle of thought between an internal and an external world.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{shall not}} marry {{a man for}} what others <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him, but for what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him <b>myself.</b> And in my view you cruelly malign him. I {{discover}} no such qualities in Sir Oliver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! it's a great annoyance,--a {{very great}} annoyance. But on such {{occasions}} <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> <b>I</b> {{never have done}} so, and don't suppose I ever shall. So you're going down to my old friend De Guest?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lane. No, sir; {{it is not}} a very {{interesting}} subject. <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>myself.</b>|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and {{all these}} glowing secrecies and hidden fancies within, walking along beside old Siddons, and half {{listening}} to his instructive discourse, I see myself as though I was an image of all humanity under tuition for the social life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not? And yet I {{would rather}} cut my tongue out than say otherwise. To {{give you my}} name is a lie,--but what should <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> were I {{to allow you to}} use any other? What would you have thought if I had asked you to go away and leave me when that bad hour came upon us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were now}} on shore in China. If I thought myself banished, and remote {{from my own}} country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for my money, what could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> now, when I was gotten about a {{thousand}} leagues farther off from home, and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return! ...|$|E
5000|$|O'Brien {{was judged}} Scotland's {{eleventh}} most eligible man in February 2009 by a Scotland on Sunday panel. He once said: [...] "I actually find the heartthrob thing laughable," [...] adding: [...] "I am just a jobbing actor from Scotland and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as particularly good looking." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY (becomes {{a mother}} to the younger ones at last). My poor sisters, come here. (They go to her doubtfully.) We must make this draw us closer together. I shall {{do my best to}} help you in every way. Just now <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{of course}} not. You're not {{that sort of}} fellow at all. But I am. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as living here with a dozen old fogies about the place all doing nothing, {{touching}} their hats, my-lording me at every turn, looking respectable, but as idle as pickpockets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} what my lips utter?" [...] he argued. [...] "They are only my lips. But I shall think Otoo always. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> I shall think of you. Whenever men call me by name, I shall think of you. And beyond the sky and beyond the stars, always and forever, you shall be Otoo to me. Is it well, master?" ...|$|E
60|$|What am I writing? I {{ought to}} be ashamed of myself! Is it nothing to have had all the beauty of land and sea, all the glory of cloud and sunshine, {{revealed}} to me? Is it nothing {{to be able to look}} at my fellow-creatures--to see the bright faces of children smile at me when I speak to them? Enough of myself! I am unhappy and ungrateful when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he gave it}} up for me. Oh, {{what does}} it matter! We're all filthy in some things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as so superior, but I do eat and digest, I do wash my dirty paws and scratch. I'm not a cool slim goddess on a column. There aren't any! He gave it up for me. He stands by me, believing that every one loves me. He's the Rock of Ages--in a storm of meanness that's driving me mad [...] . it will drive me mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mel. Yet I {{have the}} comfort of a cast lover: <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> well <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and despise my mistresses. [...] [Exit.|$|R
5000|$|... :"I {{began to}} meet {{other people who were}} into that sort of thing," [...] he recalls, [...] "and <b>I</b> started to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a circus performer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say <b>I</b> <b>think</b> much <b>of</b> them <b>myself,</b> Tommy. We {{must make}} the best of it. To begin with, we must get you proper clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was still}} debating the doctor's generalization. [...] "I suppose {{it would be}} true to say that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as mankind on his planet, with very {{considerable}} possibilities and with only {{a limited amount of}} fuel at his disposal to achieve them. Yes.... I agree that I think in that way.... I have not thought much before {{of the way in which}} I think about things--but I agree that it is in that way. Whatever enterprises mankind attempts are limited by the sum total of that store of fuel upon the planet. That is very much in my mind. Besides that he has nothing but his annual allowance of energy from the sun." ...|$|E
6000|$|He went on: [...] "But I suppose that's {{just the}} point that such a nature as young Dryfoos's can't get hold of, or keep hold of. We're a queer lot, down there, Isabel--perfect menagerie. If it hadn't been that Fulkerson got us together, and really seems {{to know what he}} did it for, I should say he was the oddest stick among us. But when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and my own crankiness for the {{literary}} department; and young Dryfoos, who ought really to be in the pulpit, or a monastery, or something, for publisher; and that young Beaton, who probably hasn't a moral fibre in his composition, for the art man, I don't know but we could give Fulkerson odds and still beat him in oddity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> Dad has loved me. He {{has been as}} a father to me. You know he's not my real father. Oh, if I only had a real one!... And I owe him so much. But then it's not because I owe him or because I love him. It's because of his own soul!... That splendid, noble old man, who has been so good to every one--who had only one fault, and that love of his son--must he be let go in blinded and insane rage at the failure of his life, the ruin of his son--must he be allowed to kill his own flesh and blood?... It would be murder! It would damn dad's soul to {{everlasting}} torment. No! No! I'll not let that be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so miserable that <b>I</b> could <b>think</b> only <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> This was mean. It was cruel too. And besides I had {{not given}} it up--not then." ...|$|R
6000|$|AMY, rather complacently, 'That is {{just how}} I feel. But <b>I</b> must not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> They are overhead, Ginevra. There is an awful scene taking place--up there. She is telling father all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To be sure!” {{cried the}} professor, {{struck by the}} idea. “Why did <b>I</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that <b>myself?</b> <b>I</b> was too upset to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything. Yes, <b>I</b> can whistle for them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, I consented; but {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> at that moment, I always am reminded, {{in a small}} way, of Adam taking the apple; and my wife, seated on that roll of carpet, has more than once suggested to my mind the classic image of Pandora opening her unlucky box. In fact, from the moment I had blandly assented to Mr. Ketchem's remarks, and said to my wife, with a gentle air of dignity, [...] "Well, my dear, since it suits you, I think you had better take it," [...] there came a load on my prophetic soul which not all the fluttering and chattering of my delighted girls and the more placid complacency of my wife could entirely dissipate. I presaged I know not what of coming woe, and all I presaged came to pass.|$|E
60|$|I had {{a letter}} from George {{yesterday}} with good news of dearest Mrs. Martin. May it be true. But I can't understand whether you have spent this winter in Devonshire or Worcestershire, or where. The thick gloom of it is over now, yet I find myself full of regrets. It's so hard {{to have to get}} out into the workday world, daylight, open air and all, and there's a duty on me to go to France, that Robert may see his father. You would pity me if you could see how I dread it. Arabel will meet me, and spend at least the summer with us, probably in the neighbourhood of Paris, and after just the first, we--even I--may be the happier. Don't tell anyone that I feel so. I should like to go into a cave for the year. Not that I haven't taken to work again, and to my old interests in politics. One doesn't quite rot in one's selfishness, after all. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as little as possible; it's the only way to bear life, to throw oneself out of the personal.|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} on shore in China; if I thought myself banished, and remote {{from my own}} country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get home for my money, what could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> now, when I was about a {{thousand}} leagues farther off from home, and destitute of all manner of prospect of return? All we had for it was this: that in about four months' time {{there was to be}} another fair at the place where we were, and then {{we might be able to}} purchase various manufactures of the country, and withal might possibly find some Chinese junks from Tonquin for sail, that would carry us and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very well, and resolved to wait; besides, as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to some other place in India nearer home. Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country.|$|E
5000|$|Kershner {{was the son}} of Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants. He {{considered}} himself an internationalist, saying [...] "I've been a student of Christianity. I've been interested in the historical basis of the Muslim religion. I studied Buddhism. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as a Jew except by birth, as I don't follow the customs. I'm a Jew because other people consider me so. My pride is in being international." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just a name {{a fellow}} gave me once {{up on the}} Yukon," [...] {{explained}} Bridge. [...] "I used to use a few words he'd never heard before, so he called me 'The Unabridged,' which was too long. The fellows shortened it to 'Bridge' and it stuck. It has always stuck, and now I haven't any other. <b>I</b> even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> now, as Bridge. Funny, ain't it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet {{has said}} that: Of all the modern {{economic}} theories, {{the economic system}} of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. (...) The failure of the regime in the former Soviet Union was, for me, not the failure of Marxism but the failure of totalitarianism. For this reason <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as half-Marxist, half-Buddhist.|$|R
