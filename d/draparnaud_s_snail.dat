This work reports the effect of co-infection of Angiostrongylus vasorum and S. mansoni in hemocyte activity and in the outcome of infection. The simultaneous infection resulted in an increase of <b>snail</b> susceptibility to <b>S.</b> mansoni. In contrast, snails infected with both parasites, 15 days apart, did not show differences in the susceptibility compared to a single parasite infection. The increased susceptibility was measured by the significantly higher number of migrating sporocysts, higher percentage of snails shedding cercariae, higher number of cercariae shed and higher mortality in the experimental group that were simultaneously infected with A. vasorum and S. mansoni, when compared to snails infected only with <b>S.</b> mansoni. <b>Snails</b> simultaneously infected with A. vasorum and S. mansoni showed lower hemocyte activation during {{the first few days of}} infection, compared to activation induced only by A. vasorum infection. Between 5 and 15 days post-infection (dpi), granulocyte number and nitric oxide (NO) contents of simultaneously infected snails were lower than the <b>S.</b> mansoni-infected <b>snails.</b> Based on the results, we suggest that differences in the level of hemocyte response could explain the increased S. mansoni susceptibility observed in snails simultaneously infected with both parasites. However, when S. mansoni infection occurred after A. vasorum larvae are completely encapsulated, the response against S. mansoni was not altered, and therefore there were no differences in the susceptibility level...|$|R

Surveillance {{methods that}} can identify locations where schistosomiasis has reemerged {{are needed to}} prevent the further spread of infections. We tested humans, cows, water buffalo and the intermediate host snail, Oncomelania hupensis, for Schistosoma japonicum infection, assessed snail densities and extracted regional surveillance records in areas where schistosomiasis reemerged in Sichuan province. We then evaluated the ability of surveillance methods to identify villages where human infections were present. Human infections were detected in 35 of the 53 villages surveyed (infection prevalence: 0 to 43 %), including 17 of 28 villages with no prior evidence of reemergence. Bovine infections were detected in 23 villages (infection prevalence: 0 to 65 %) and snail infections in one village. Two common surveillance methods, acute schistosomiasis case reports and surveys for <b>S.</b> japonicum-infected <b>snails,</b> grossly underestimated the number of villages where human infections were present (sensitivity 1 % and 3 %, respectively).

Older adults and bovine owners were at elevated risk of infection. Testing only these high-risk human populations yielded sensitivities of 77 % and 71 %, respectively. Human and bovine schistosomiasis were widespread in regions where schistosomiasis had reemerged but acute schistosomiasis and <b>S.</b> japonicum-infected <b>snails</b> were rare and, therefore, poor surveillance targets.

30|$|Furthermore, {{when the}} {{carrying}} capacity of prey (K) {{is bigger than}} a critical value (K_ 1), the coexistence equilibrium with prey and predator is stable, i.e., animals and their natural enemies can coexist. When the carrying capacity of prey {{is less than the}} critical value, prey and predator can not coexist. This can also explain why a lot of animals and natural enemies coexist in nature [27, 28]. In 1930 <b>s,</b> Hawaii’s <b>snail</b> disaster is a very good example. In the Hawaii islands, the big snails were bred in a small region and eaten by human beings. Some old snails were thrown in the wild, which meant the carrying capacity of snail increased. A few years later, a large number of breeding snails were everywhere. This meant that snails and humans coexisted. People sprayed chemicals and cultivated land for 15 consecutive years, but also could not remove the snails [27]. According to this conclusion, human beings can control the amount of prey and predator by adjusting the carrying capacity of prey. Based on these analyses, {{it is easy to see}} that the carrying capacity of prey and the Allee effect of prey in the refuge can influence biological environment. In addition, in this model the migration rate of prey can affect the number of equilibria and the stability. However, the purpose of this paper was to study the impact of Allee effect and the carrying capacity of prey. Hence, we have only considered the particular case in this paper, and the general case will be considered in the future.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Schistosomiasis is an {{important}} parasitic disease that infects humans. Among the main species of schistosomes infecting humans is Schistosoma mansoni and <b>S.</b> haematobium. <b>Snails</b> of various genera, such as Biomphalaria alexandrina and Bulinus truncates, act as intermediate hosts and {{play a major role}} in the transmission of schistosomes. Transmission from human to snail is under the influence of the ciliated miracidium larvae that hatch from the eggs of the parasite voided in the faeces or urine. After a period of asexual multiplication in the snail, a second aquatic larval stage, the cercaria, emerges and infects human by direct penetration of the skin. The present work was carried out on Biomphalaria alexandrina snails, the intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni. Snails were collected from various sites in south western Saudi Arabia. Their progeny were reared in the laboratory under standard conditions. Different biological experiments were carried out to determine the susceptibility level in the various populations of snail. The miracidia were obtained by isolating viable ova of the hatching parasite from faeces of infected individuals (human and mice). Different sets of regulated experimental infection of snails with the miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni were preformed. The effect of miracidial density, water temperature, miracidial age, size of snails, as well as light and darkness were investigated. The study revealed that the infection rate increased as the number of miracidia used increased (1, 60 %; 2, 60 %; 3, 70 %; 5, 80 %; 15, 90 %; and 20, 90 %).

A research program was initiated {{at the same time to}} develop new control techniques. Often, Extension’s agents and Research personnel’s organized dialogue and briefing sessions to disseminate information and to motivate farmers to participate in the control operation.

The most common control measures adopted by farmers were tea seed powder applications, handpicking, water depth management and the use of older seedlings in transplanting. Biological control consisted of duck herding recommended at a density of 5 - 10 ducks/ha. The duck reduced the pest population to a tolerable level after grazing for a period of one to two months. It was foreseen that the pest is going to spread to all the rice-growing areas in Sabah in the future by man activities. So at present it is essential to educate the farmers on the management of the golden apple snail in rice so that should an outbreak occurs, farmers are able to contain the pest themselves...|$|R
40|$|For decades {{scientists}} {{believed that}} herbivory had minimal impact on freshwater ecosystems. We {{now know that}} herbivory in freshwater systems equals or exceeds herbivory in terrestrial and marine systems. In extreme cases, herbivores can change clear, macrophyte dominated ecosystems into turbid plankton dominated ecosystems. Even though research on plant-herbivore interactions in freshwater systems has increased, {{there is still much}} that is unknown. This thesis is comprised of four studies investigating freshwater plant-herbivore interactions across multiple spatial scales. The first study investigated how induced chemical defenses in Cabomba caroliniana suppress herbivore consumption and growth as well as how this herbivore-generated change in plant chemistry affects the growth of plant associated microbes. At the spatial scale of individual ponds or lakes, consumers that induce their host plants may also be indirectly affecting other consumers and microbial pathogens via changes in this shared resource. The second study moves to an ecosystem scale and investigates how exotic versus native apple snails may impact Everglades' habitats. We investigated plant preference, consumption, growth and conversion efficiencies in the singly native apple snail to occur in the U. S. (Pomacea paludosa) versus four introduced species (P. canaliculata, P. insularum, P. haustrum and P. diffusa). We found that even though plant preferences are similar, invasive snails tend to eat more, grow more rapidly, and sometimes more efficiently than natives. This suggests that invasive species could have a large impact on the environment, especially the abundance of submerged plants. The third study investigated how palatability of freshwater plants varies with latitude (i. e. geographic scale). Increased herbivory at lower latitudes is hypothesized to select for increased plant defenses, which {{has been shown to be}} true for tropical forests, salt marshes, and seaweeds. When we contrasted eight confamilial plants collected in Indiana versus Southern Florida, three of four herbivores significantly preferred northern plants. When we evaluated a second set of plants collected from Indiana versus Central Florida, only one of three herbivores preferred the northern plants. Overall, our results suggest a preference for northern plants, but the strength of this relationship was variable. We hypothesize that this variability may be driven by 1) local variance in herbivore pressure that creates variance in plant defenses, and/or 2) the effect of winter length on the survival and feeding rate of herbivores. The final study expanded to a world scale, and investigated herbivore preference for native vs exotic plants. We found that both N. American crayfish and <b>S.</b> American <b>snails</b> preferred exotic plants over confamilial natives, despite responding to different plant characteristics. The single species of apple snail that occurs in N. American showed no preference for native or exotic plants from a N. American perspective, but instead exhibited preferences that correlated with its history of evolution in S. America. As the N. American species is a sister species of the <b>S.</b> American <b>snails,</b> feeding by the N. American snail appears more affected by its S. American lineage than its recent history in N. America. This suggests that phylogenetic legacy will affect choices of the herbivore as well as resistance or susceptibility of plants. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Mark Hay; Committee Member: Dr. J.

40|$|One of the world's most {{prevalent}} neglected diseases is schistosomiasis, which infects approximately 200 million people worldwide. Schistosoma mansoni is transmitted to humans by skin penetration by free-living larvae that develop in freshwater snails. The origin {{of this species}} is East Africa, where it coexists with its sister species, S. rodhaini. Interactions between these species potentially influence their epidemiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, because they infect the same species of hosts and can hybridize. Over two years, we examined their distribution in Kenya to determine their degree of overlap geographically, within snail hosts, and {{in the water column}} as infective stages. Both species were spatially and temporally patchy, although S. mansoni was eight times more common than S. rodhaini. Both species overlap in the time of day they were present in the water column, which increases the potential for the species to coinfect the same host and interbreed. Peak infective time for S. mansoni was midday and dawn and dusk for <b>S.</b> rodhaini. Three <b>snails</b> were coinfected, which was more common than expected by chance.

40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor Snail 1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process {{responsible for the}} acquisition of invasiveness during tumorigenesis. Several transcriptomic studies have reported Snail 1 -regulated genes in different cell types, many of them involved in cell adhesion. However, only {{a few studies have}} used proteomics as a tool for the characterization of proteins mediating EMT. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified by proteomic analysis using 2 D-DIGE electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF and ESI-linear ion trap mass spectrometry a number of proteins with variable functions whose expression is modulated by Snail 1 in SW 480 -ADH human colon cancer cells. Validation was performed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Snail 1 repressed several members of the 14 - 3 - 3 family of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine binding proteins and also the expression of the Proliferation-associated protein 2 G 4 (PA 2 G 4) that was mainly localized at the nuclear Cajal bodies. In contrast, the expression of two proteins involved in RNA processing, the Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF 6) and the Splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ), was higher in Snail 1 -expressing cells than in controls. The regulation of 14 - 3 - 3 e, 14 - 3 - 3 t, 14 - 3 - 3 f and PA 2 G 4 by Snail 1 was reproduced in HT 29 colon cancer cells. In addition, we found an inverse correlation between 14 - 3 - 3 <b>s</b> and <b>Snail</b> 1 expression in human colorectal tumors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} infection {{that continues to}} be a major public health problem in many developing countries being responsible for an estimated burden of at least 1. 4 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Africa alone. However, morbidity due to schistosomiasis has been greatly reduced {{in some parts of the}} world, including Zanzibar. The Zanzibar government is now committed to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis. Over the next 3 [...] 5 years, the whole at-risk population will be administered praziquantel (40 mg/kg) biannually. Additionally, snail control and behaviour change interventions will be implemented in selected communities and the impact measured in a randomized intervention trial. METHODS: In this 5 -year research study, on both Unguja and Pemba islands, urogenital schistosomiasis will be assessed in 45 communities with urine filtration and reagent strips in 4, 500 schoolchildren aged 9 [...] 12 years annually, and in 4, 500 first-year schoolchildren and 2, 250 adults in years 1 and 5. Additionally, from first-year schoolchildren, a finger-prick blood sample will be collected and examined for Schistosoma haematobium infection biomarkers. Changes in prevalence and infection intensity will be assessed annually. Among the 45 communities, 15 were randomized for biannual snail control with niclosamide, in concordance with preventive chemotherapy campaigns. The reduction of Bulinus globosus <b>snail</b> populations and <b>S.</b> haematobium-infected <b>snails</b> will be investigated. In 15 other communities, interventions triggering behaviour change have been designed and will be implemented in collaboration with the community. A change in knowledge, attitudes and practices will be assessed annually through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with schoolchildren, teachers, parents and community leaders. In all 45 communities, changes in the health system, water and sanitation infrastructure will be annually tracked by standardized questionnaire-interviews with community leaders. Additional issues potentially impacting on study outcomes and all incurring costs will be monitored and recorded. DISCUSSION: Elimination of schistosomiasis has become a priority on the agenda of the Zanzibar government and the international community. Our study will contribute to identifying what, in addition to preventive chemotherapy, needs to be done to prevent, control, and ultimately eliminate schistosomiasis, and to draw lessons for current and future schistosomiasis elimination programmes in Africa and elsewhere.

However, the role of PDK 1 in cardiovascular development remains unknown. Here, we deleted PDK 1 specifically in endothelial cells in mice. These mice displayed hemorrhage and hydropericardium and died at approximately embryonic day 11. 5 (E 11. 5). Histological analysis revealed defective vascular remodeling and development and disrupted integrity between the endothelium and trabeculae/myocardium in the heart. The atrioventricular canal (AVC) cushion and valves failed to form, indicating a defect in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), together with increased endothelial apoptosis.

The prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides were 6. 1 %, 5. 2 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite detected (12. 0 %).

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that molluscs may {{be sensitive to the}} effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in a similar manner to vertebrates, such as fish. Despite this (with the exception of TBT-induced imposex in marine gastropods), molluscs have been largely overlooked in the field of endocrine disruption. Life-cycle studies were conducted in which two species of native UK freshwater gastropod molluscs (the hermaphrodite Planorbarius corneus and the gonochorist Viviparus viviparus) were exposed to either 17 β-oestradiol or environmentally relevant mixtures of chemicals known to be oestrogenic to vertebrates and to be present in UK treated sewage effluents (TSE) and rivers. Adult snails were exposed for four months in outdoor mesocosms, fed by river water, over the spring and summer (breeding season) in order to examine effects on reproductive output, growth and mortality. Furthermore, offspring (F 1 s) were also developmentally exposed over the same period. F 1 juvenile snails were then depurated in river water for nine months (over winter) after which time their growth, survival, and reproductive success were measured in further un-dosed river water mesocosm studies in the following spring/summer. Histopathology was used to determine immediate effects of chemical exposure on adult and F 1 snails’ reproductive health. Histopathology was also used to determine long lasting effects of chemical exposure on depurated F 1 s.

40|$|Background:An {{increasing}} risk of Schistosoma mansoni infection {{has been}} observed around Lake Victoria, western Kenya since the 1970 s. Understanding local transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis is crucial in curtailing increased risk of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings:We carried out a cross sectional study on a population of 310 children from eight primary schools. Overall, a total of 238 (76. 8 %) children were infected with S. mansoni, while seven (2. 3 %) had S. haematobium. The prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura and Ascaris lumbricoides were 6. 1 %, 5. 2 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite detected (12. 0 %). High local population density within a 1 km radius around houses {{was identified as a}} major independent risk factor of S. mansoni infection. A spatial cluster of high infection risk was detected around the Mbita causeway following adjustment for population density and other potential risk factors. Conclusions/Significance:Population density was shown to be a major factor fuelling schistosome infection while individual socio-economic factors appeared not to affect the infection risk. The high-risk cluster around the Mbita causeway may be explained by the construction of an artificial pathway that may cause increased numbers of <b>S.</b> mansoni host <b>snails</b> through obstruction of the waterway. This construction may have, therefore, a significant negative impact on the health of the local population, especially school-aged children who frequently come in contact with lake water. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 725 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 20 日Author: Sachiyo Nagi, Evans A.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Recent evidence suggests that molluscs may {{be sensitive to the}} effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in a similar manner to vertebrates, such as fish. Despite this (with the exception of TBT-induced imposex in marine gastropods), molluscs have been largely overlooked in the field of endocrine disruption. Life-cycle studies were conducted in which two species of native UK freshwater gastropod molluscs (the hermaphrodite Planorbarius corneus and the gonochorist Viviparus viviparus) were exposed to either 17 β-oestradiol or environmentally relevant mixtures of chemicals known to be oestrogenic to vertebrates and to be present in UK treated sewage effluents (TSE) and rivers. Adult snails were exposed for four months in outdoor mesocosms, fed by river water, over the spring and summer (breeding season) in order to examine effects on reproductive output, growth and mortality. Furthermore, offspring (F 1 s) were also developmentally exposed over the same period. F 1 juvenile snails were then depurated in river water for nine months (over winter) after which time their growth, survival, and reproductive success were measured in further un-dosed river water mesocosm studies in the following spring/summer. Histopathology was used to determine immediate effects of chemical exposure on adult and F 1 snails’ reproductive health. Histopathology was also used to determine long lasting effects of chemical exposure on depurated F 1 s. Exposure to oestrogenic chemicals resulted in a range of effects, including modulated fecundity and growth in F 0 adults, to retardation of growth, sexual development and fecundity in developmentally exposed F 1 s. Exposure to mixtures of oestrogenic chemicals also resulted in possible modulation of the immune system, resulting in increased parasitism and over winter mortality of exposed F 1 <b>s</b> compared to <b>snails</b> exposed to river water alone.

40|$|Abstract Background Schistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} infection {{that continues to}} be a major public health problem in many developing countries being responsible for an estimated burden of at least 1. 4 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Africa alone. Importantly, morbidity due to schistosomiasis has been greatly reduced {{in some parts of the}} world, including Zanzibar. The Zanzibar government is now committed to eliminate urogenital schistosomiasis. Over the next 3 – 5 years, the whole at-risk population will be administered praziquantel (40 mg/kg) biannually. Additionally, snail control and behaviour change interventions will be implemented in selected communities and the outcomes and impact measured in a randomized intervention trial. Methods/Design In this 5 -year research study, on both Unguja and Pemba islands, urogenital schistosomiasis will be assessed in 45 communities with urine filtration and reagent strips in 4, 500 schoolchildren aged 9 – 12 years annually, and in 4, 500 first-year schoolchildren and 2, 250 adults in years 1 and 5. Additionally, from first-year schoolchildren, a finger-prick blood sample will be collected and examined for Schistosoma haematobium infection biomarkers. Changes in prevalence and infection intensity will be assessed annually. Among the 45 communities, 15 were randomized for biannual snail control with niclosamide, in concordance with preventive chemotherapy campaigns. The reduction of Bulinus globosus <b>snail</b> populations and <b>S.</b> haematobium -infected <b>snails</b> will be investigated. In 15 other communities, interventions triggering behaviour change have been designed and will be implemented in collaboration with the community. A change in knowledge, attitudes and practices will be assessed annually through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with schoolchildren, teachers, parents and community leaders. In all 45 communities, changes in the health system, water and sanitation infrastructure will be annually tracked by standardized questionnaire-interviews with community leaders. Additional issues potentially impacting on study outcomes and all incurring costs will be recordedand monitored longitudinally. Discussion Elimination of schistosomiasis has become a priority on the agenda of the Zanzibar government and the international community. Our study will contribute to identifying what, in addition to preventive chemotherapy, needs to be done to prevent, control, and ultimately eliminate schistosomiasis, and to draw lessons for current and future schistosomiasis elimination programmes in Africa and elsewhere.

40|$|Since Solem’s provocative {{claim in}} the early 1980 <b>s</b> that land <b>snails</b> in {{tropical}} forests are neither abundant nor diverse, at least 30 quantitative-ecological papers on tropical land snail communities have appeared. Jointly, these papers have shown that site diversity is, in fact, high in tropical forests; often more than 100 species have been recorded per site, which is somewhat more than normally found at sites in higher latitudes. At the same time, however, point diversities (which usually range between 10 and 30 species per quadrat) appear to be {{no different from the}} ones recorded for temperate localities, which suggests that the number of ways in which syntopic resource space can be subdivided among different land snail species has an upper limit that is no higher under tropical conditions. The available data do not allow much analysis of the ecological structuring processes of communities besides very coarse ones, e. g. the proportions of carnivores versus herbivores and Pulmonata versus non-pulmonates. Also, these first 30 years of research have shown that a number of serious methodological and conceptual issues need to be resolved for the field to move ahead; in particular whether empty shells from the forest floor may be used as a proxy for the contemporaneous communities. I make a number of suggestions for ways in which these obstacles may be removed. First, studies should be preceded by exploratory nested sampling in contiguous quadrats of increasing size, spanning several orders of magnitude. The shape of the triphasic species-area curve and nonlinear regression of the small-area end of the curve will help identify the quadrat and site areas that allow ecologically more meaningful studies. Second, researchers should be more aware of the trophic levels of species and restrict their analyses within guilds and within body size classes as much as possible. Testing species abundance distributions against ecologically explicit theoretical models may be a fruitful avenue for research. Finally, I argue that studies of this nature require species abundances that may only be found in tropical land snail communities that live on calcareous substrate, and therefore I suggest that malacologists aiming to understand community structure focus on limestone sites initially...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the influence of rainfall seasonality on the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection among school-aged children in Kaedi, southern Mauritania. Cross-sectional surveys (i. e. parasitological, malacological and observations on water-related human activities) were carried out in Kaedi between September 2014 and May 2015, during both the wet and dry seasons. A total of 2162 children aged 5 - 15  years provided a single urine sample that was subjected to <b>S.</b> haematobium diagnosis. <b>Snails</b> were sampled and checked for cercarial shedding. Water contact patterns of the local population were recorded by direct observation. The prevalence of S. haematobium was 4. 0 % (86 / 2162, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 2 - 4. 9 %) with a geometric mean egg count per 10  ml of urine of 3. 7 (95 % CI: 2. 8 - 4. 3). Being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 13 - 2. 80), being at primary school (aOR 1. 73, 95 % CI: 1. 04 - 2. 87) and dry season (aOR 0. 56, 95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 89) {{were significantly associated with}} S. haematobium. Among 284 potential intermediate host snail specimens collected over the rainy and dry seasons, three species were identified: Bulinus senegalensis (n =  13) and B. forskalii (n =  161) in the rainy season, and B. truncatus (n =  157) in the wet season. No snail was shedding cercariae. On average, seven human water contacts were recorded per hour per observer over a 28 -day observation period. Twelve types of water contact activities were identified among which, swimming/bathing was predominant (n =  3788, 36. 9 %), followed by washing clothes (n =  2016, 19. 7 %) and washing dishes (n =  1322, 12. 9 %). Females (n =  5270, 51. 4 %) were slightly more in contact with water than males (n =  4983, 48. 6 %). The average time spent in the water per person per day was 14. 2  min (95 % CI: 13. 8 - 14. 6  min). The frequency and duration of water contact followed a seasonal pattern.

40|$|A {{baseline}} {{survey was conducted}} in the Lower Moshi Rice Irrigation Scheme from mid-March to June 1990, aiming at finding out the prevalence for schistosomiasis 	and related transmission factors for the disease. 	The findings revealed prevalences of 3. 8 % and 30. 9 % for schistosomiasis haematobia and mansoni respectively. Among the study population, 0. 5 % of the individuals were infected with both S. haematobium and <b>S.</b> mansoni. Biomphalaria <b>snail</b> species were predominant compared to Bulinus species in the water bodies surveyed. Poor sanitation was {{a problem in the}} study area. The April 1990 flood disaster reduced the previously observed latrine-coverage of households from 84. 5 % to 24. 3 %. Before t?e floods, about 10. 5 % of latrines were good and clean, 59. 7 % were satisfactory and 29. 8 % were. unfit for use. After the floods, only 4. 8 % of latrines remained in the satisfactory category whereas the rest became unfit for use. On the other hand, no single latrine was sighted throughout the rice fields.

40|$|Background: Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} is the most lethal {{gynecological}} malignancy and is a highly metastatic cancer characterized by widespread peritoneal dissemination and ascites. The 70 kDa S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K) is a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is frequently activated in human ovarian cancer. We recently demonstrated a novel role of p 70 S 6 K in the invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Since epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step contributing to tumor invasiveness, we hypothesized that p 70 S 6 K activation induced molecular alterations that mediate EMT. Materials and Methods: To examine the roles of p 70 S 6 K, constitutively active forms of p 70 S 6 K were transfected into the ovarian cancer cell lines, and the consequence of their transfection was investigated. Optical microscopy {{was used to assess}} changes in cell morphology and behavior. Western blot, reverse transcription (RT) -PCR, and reporter gene assays were employed to measure the expression and activity of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Results: We showed that ovarian cancer cells expressed constitutively active p 70 S 6 K underwent phenotypic changes consistent with EMT: the cells lost epithelial cell morphology, acquired fibroblast-like properties, and showed reduced intercellular adhesion. Western blot and RT-PCR revealed strong reduction of the epithelial marker E-cadherin expression and activation of mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin in p 70 S 6 Kexpressing cells. Consistently, p 70 S 6 K downregulation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or the specific mTOR/p 70 S 6 K inhibitor rapamycin caused the reversion to an epithelial phenotype, in which E-cadherin was relocalized to the plasma membrane. In addition, active p 70 S 6 K induced upregulation of Snail, a repressor of E-cadherin and an inducer of the EMT, which could be reverted by siRNA-mediated repression of p 70 S 6 K, indicating that p 70 S 6 K-induced EMT depends on Snail. We also showed that p 70 S 6 K enhanced Snail activity through inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK 3 b), as expression of constitutively active GSK 3 b blocked p 70 <b>S</b> 6 K-dependent <b>Snail</b> activation. Conclusion: Our study indicates, for the first time, that activation of p 70 S 6 K mediates EMT through upregulation of Snail via GSK 3 b. These findings not only expand the spectrum of biological activities of p 70 S 6 K but also suggest that therapeutic inhibition of p 70 S 6 K may be a useful strategy to control ovarian tumor invasion and metastasis (supported by RGC HKU 7599 / 05 M). link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} and expression of disease {{is influenced by}} interactions that occur between hosts, parasites, and their environment. Host organisms are often infected with multiple parasite genotypes or species, and {{the severity of the}} disease that they experience can depend on the intraspecific and interspecific competition that occurs among the parasites within them. In addition to the impact of infection, hosts must also deal with stressors in their environment such as increased temperature or drought. Hosts can respond to parasite infection or environmental stress by altering their life history, but little is known about how hosts respond to infection and stress at the same time. ^ The primary objective of my dissertation research was to explore and describe the impacts that different stressors, including environmental stress and competition, have on host – parasite dynamics. Specifically, this dissertation explores the impact of stressors on host and parasite life history, and the expression of life history adaptations. To do this I used trematode parasite systems, which have complex life cycles that include vertebrate definitive hosts and aquatic snail intermediate hosts. I first reviewed our current understanding of parasite competition and postulated that the amount of movement and resistance in host populations could increase or decrease the relatedness of intraspecific infections, and thus influence the amount of damage, or virulence, that those infections inflict on their hosts. To test the influence of intraspecific relatedness on virulence I then compared related and unrelated infections of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni in snail intermediate hosts and found support for kin selection theory predictions, in which related parasite infections have lower virulence than unrelated parasite infections. Intermediate hosts infected with unrelated parasites were more similar in their life history to those infected with the less damaging of the two parasites in the infection. ^ To determine the impact of intraspecific parasite relatedness on infections in the definitive host, I infected mice with related and unrelated S. mansoni infections and determined that, as with the intermediate host infections, unrelated infections were more similar in their life history and virulence to one of the two parasites in the composition. In the definitive hosts the infection with unrelated parasites more closely resembled that of the more damaging parasite. These results suggest that there are trade-offs in virulence and infectivity between host stages, and that there could be selection for lower virulence at the intermediate host level while there is selection for higher virulence at the definitive host level. ^ Next, I used a local trematode system to examine the patterns of interspecific competition and their influence on parasite community structure. I hypothesized that weaker competitors (parasites with sporocysts) should avoid co-infection with stronger competitors (parasites with rediae) by avoiding them in time, to prevent exclusion via predation. Specifically, I expected that sporocyst stage parasites would exhibit high prevalence early in the infection season, while redial stage parasites would predominate {{at the end of the}} season. While co-infections were rare, I did not document this predicted pattern, suggesting that parasites may have another method of competition avoidance. ^ To examine the ability of hosts and parasites to respond adaptively to stressful environments, I subjected <b>S.</b> mansoni infected <b>snail</b> intermediate hosts and uninfected snail intermediate hosts to drought stress and recorded their life history responses compared them to unstressed hosts. The intermediate host of S. mansoni has life history adaptations in response to infection (fecundity compensation, in which snails increase their reproductive output in response to infection) and to drought (aestivation, in which snails enter a dormant state to survive desiccation). Interestingly, snails that were infected and also experiencing drought stressed did not express the fecundity compensation life history response, suggesting that the presence of two stressors eliminated the ability of the host to respond to infection. However, parasites in infected hosts did exhibit a fecundity compensation response, in which drought-stressed infected hosts produced significantly more parasites than those that were not drought-stressed. This was the first documentation of a parasite life history adaptation to host environmental stress. These findings enhance our knowledge about host-parasite dynamics and life history adaptations, and shed light on the impacts of stressors on the intensity of disease. ...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese comics {{industry}} is several {{times larger than}} that of comparable nations, {{and in the past}} ten years, it has made inroads in the west. This paper analyzes the reasons for the vast success of the Japanese comics industry compared to the other two great comics industries, the American and the French. The first chapter deals with the basics of production: Japanese comics are well distributed; available everywhere when American comics are only sold in specialised comics stores. Japanese comics run as serials in thick (1000 -page) magazines and are then collected into 250 -page paperbacks; these publications are much more attractive to readers and retailers than the 36 -page B 4 leaflets the American comics {{industry is}} producing. The French comics industry has a better format: hardbound, 44 -page, A 4 albums; luxurious publications that retail at a high price; and while the American comics industry has been virtually taken over by Japanese-translated comics in the past two years, in France, the Japanese comics have taken no more than one third of the market. Cartoonist is an attractive profession in Japan; the many 1000 -page magazines that must be filled each month or week provide many cartoonists with a reasonably stable lower middle class lifestyle, and the cartoonists retain the ownership of their own creations, meaning that the most popular cartoonists can become very wealthy. The American comics industry is offering a work-for-hire contract where the cartoonists are paid per page and all authors rights belong to the publisher, meaning that there is little incentive for cartoonists to create new characters and concepts. Then, the Japanese comics industry enjoys a synergy with animated film that neither the American or French industries have been able to build. The 1000 -page magazines that have millions of readers are a natural content provider for TV and film, and since Japanese comics are not necessarily for children, there are also many animated cartoons produced for the video market, containing more violence and nudity than broadcast standards will allow. Chapter two looks at some aspects of comics creation in Japan. Japanese comic serials do not run eternally; they are feuilletons with beginnings and finales. This is interesting to readers and convenient to the comics magazines, as it leaves up space for new titles. Japanese comics draw readers in more than western comics because they use cinematic techniques (pans, close-ups, movable point of view) and have varied page lay-outs where western comics have their panels in grids as regular as a brick wall. The dichotomy between the realistic (serious) and the cartoony (humorous) drawing styles, which is the most important dichotomy in western comics, is much less pronounced in Japanese comics; Japanese cartoonists tend to use a simple, caricatured style that allows them to work fast. The detailed drawing style preferred in France means that cartoonist take years to produce a 44 -page album, so the development of new titles and genres happens at a <b>snail</b> <b>s</b> pace: partly for that reason, a handful of old titles continue to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, but new successes are few and far between. Both in America and France, comics have had problems with censorship that aimed to make all comics safe for children. The American comics industry in particular never fully recovered from the 1954 outcry against violent comics, which led to the establisment of the Comics Code Authority, a censorship body that not only cuts out sexual references and excessive violence, but also demands that comics never create disrespect for established authority and that good must triumph over evil in every story. The Japanese comics industry has been able to build its youth market because it has been allowed to create morally ambiguous stories with nudity and violence as much as the film industry has. In the third chapter, {{we take a look at}} comics as a form of literature or art. There have been a few Japanese cartoonists who have had ambitions in this direction, but while the monthly deadlines and cheap publications are a conductive environment for popular entertainment, Japanese cartoonists would need to be able to work without a set deadline if they were to produce comics that could be considered serious literature. An animation director can set up his own studio, finance each project separately and take the time he needs, and the award-winning Miyazaki Hayao is the most successful cartoonist in the world today because he has the freedom to operate independently, taking three years to finish a film. Japanese cartoonists do not tend to take on the role of serious artists that comment on society; their work is entertainment, but as comic sales in Japan are showing signs of decline, the comics industry is attempting to develop more socially conscious stories, and has struck gold with Burakku Jakku e Yoroshiku, a series about Japan s cynical medical industry...|$|R
40|$|Availability of {{good quality}} seeds for sowing makes or breaks food {{production}} worldwide. It is an age-old issue, for {{which in the}} course of time countless smart and cunning technical solutions have been developed. The Green Revolution is one such. Nonetheless, food shortages persist. Strengthening local seed supply systems is the trend which is gaining ground in the world of development, research and policymaking. The production and distribution of uniform, high quality seed is big business. It is based on a complex jumble of knowledge, products, rules and services. Research organisations develop specific varieties of plants. Specialised industries produce fertilisers and pesticides, and process and treat the product. Other companies provide transport and storage, banks provide the investment and governments the required legal environment. In short, it is a highly specialised and capital intensive area of business, which depends on a large market of cash-rich farmers with large, uniformly planted estates. For the vast majority of farmers in ACP countries this is not even remotely the reality. Most smallholder farming families are used to being responsible for the production, selection, storage and distribution or exchange of their own seeds. Taste, a guaranteed yield, adaptation to local climatic and soil conditions, resistance to pests and diseases are far more important criteria. Since these requirements are poorly attuned to the formal sector (both commercial and public), smallholder farming families are left to their own devices. Hybridisation Yet, a breeze of change is sweeping across this situation. Researchers, donors and NGOs increasingly devote themselves to bridging the formal and informal seed supply systems. Surprisingly central in their argument is their emphasis that both sides can benefit: smallholder farms get access to new knowledge and improved seeds and the formal seed sector gets access to the local varieties, which can have valuable genetic properties, like good taste, long shelf life, resistance to drought, diseases and pests. These forms of hybridisation are beginning to take shape. International seed and crop research institutes shift their focus towards local food crops and begin to act as brokers between farmers and industry. In Malawi, local farmers are selected for the multiplication of seeds for peanut plants. Farmers in Rwanda were invited to the pilot plots of a research station and explained to the researchers that new bean races should yield more to be sure, but that the beans also have to thrive on poor soils, underneath bananas and also have to survive torrential rains, which was considered more important. Furthermore seed research lodges itself more and more in farming communities in order to be in keeping with local wishes and realities. This has led to a broader scope in farming systems research and more participatory testing methods. Gender A great deal of creativity and a good sense for cultural relations in a community are essential tools for researchers warns Lisa Leimar Price, expert on gender, agriculture and biodiversity at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands. Otherwise the voice of the women will not be heard. Women play a particularly important role in seed management and development. Besides pure agricultural tasks, it is the woman who selects seeds on taste, colour and cooking characteristics if something cooks fast, that can be an important characteristic when fuelwood is scarce. Women also experiment a lot with new varieties in their homestead before when proven successful sowing it on their fields. In doing so they both influence, as well as conserve, local biodiversity. Diversity is also closely related to wealth. Poorer farming families select less according to luxurious traits like taste and potential yield but prefer resistance to diseases and drought. A creative, participatory approach might just be the way forward to achieve locally valuable seed management systems. External technical knowledge and support can contribute in developing varieties which thrive under harsh conditions and thus keep famine out. This method can also very well result in a local living genebank, a special communal plot, where farmers cultivate their selected varieties each year, with the explicit objective of conserving the available and valuable genetic variety in the community. Of course there always will be the risk of a disaster or crop failure, forcing farmers to sell or consume their own seeds. For those instances, it is essential that the seeds concerned are also stored in genebanks elsewhere and made available to farmers. And there s the rub. This material usually goes only to the carefully selected seed multipliers. Farmers, men and women, researchers, extension workers and development practitioners, are at a <b>snail</b> <b>s</b> gallop, bridging the gap between the informal and formal seed supply systems. There is no straightforward recipe. The enormous local genetic and cultural diversity, in particular, demands time-consuming, made-to-measure solutions.
