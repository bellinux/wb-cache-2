5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by infection with the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illness.</b> Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illness</b> or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E

40|$|Human {{health is}} {{affected}} {{by a variety of}} factors. Weather conditions are hardly ever the direct cause of illness, but they may be among the top underlying factors.

In particular, it focuses on extreme cases and areas of increased rates of said infections. Medical statistics and meteorological data from 16 Polish provinces were used as input to the study. The flu season was defined as the period starting in October and ending in April.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of these studies}} were to analyse the effect of mass influenza immunization in children on the morbidity of unvaccinated non-institutionalized elderly during an influenza epidemic. A mass vaccination campaign with vaccine was conducted in children aged 3 – 6 years attending kindergartens (57 · 4 % of 6374) and aged 7 – 17 years attending schools (72 % of 34 237) in two communities of the Moscow region. The clinical effectiveness of vaccination was 60 · 9 % for kindergartens and 68 · 8 % for schools.

METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the paper case report forms from all the patients with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> with nasopharyngeal samples submitted for laboratory diagnosis of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 infection during {{the first wave of}} pandemic influenza that occurred between June and August 2009, in the central region of Portugal. RESULTS: From all the patients with <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses,</b> one third was found positive for pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009. Individuals under the age of 29 (75 %) were the most affected. Most of the patients (91 %) presented with fever. A group of symptoms were positively correlated with the probability of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 infection: cough, epistaxis, lack of dyspnea or vomiting, fever, headache and myalgia.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the performance of a nonparametric forecasting method first developed in meteorology, the “method of analogues, ” in predicting influenza activity. This method uses vectors selected from historical influenza time series that match current activity. The authors applied it to forecasting the incidences of <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (ILI) in France and in the country’s 21 administrative regions, using a series of data for 938 consecutive weeks of ILI surveillance between 1984 and 2002, and compared the results with those for autoregressive models. For 1 - to 10 -week-ahead predictions, the correlation coefficients between the observed and forecasted regional incidences ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 66 for the method of analogues and from 0. 73 to – 0. 09 for the autoregressive models (p < 0. 001).

25|$|The winds carry Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii spores into nonendemic areas, a {{pathogenic}} fungus {{that causes}} Coccidioidomycosis ("Valley Fever"). Symptomatic infection (40 percent of cases) usually presents as an <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illness</b> with fever, cough, headaches, rash, and myalgia (muscle pain). Serious complications include severe pneumonia, lung nodules, and disseminated disease, where the fungus spreads throughout the body. The disseminated form of Coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body, causing skin ulcers, abscesses, bone lesions, severe joint pain, heart inflammation, urinary tract problems, meningitis, and often death.|$|E
25|$|Because these {{traditional}} methods are slow, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, proxies of transmission have been sought. One proxy {{in the case}} of influenza is tracking of <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illness</b> at certain sentinel sites of health care practitioners within a state, for example. Tools have been developed to help track influenza epidemics by finding patterns in certain web search query activity. It was found that the frequency of influenza-related web searches as a whole rises as the number of people sick with influenza rises. Examining space-time relationships of web queries has been shown to approximate the spread of influenza and dengue.|$|E

In Senegal, the network has recently been enhanced (i) to include epidemiological data from Dakar and other regions and (ii) to extend virological surveillance to other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological data from the sentinel sites is transmitted daily by mobile phone. The data include those for other febrile syndromes similar to <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> (ILI), corresponding to integrated approach. Also, clinical samples are randomly selected and analyzed for influenza and other respiratory viruses. There were 101, 640 declared visits to the 11 sentinel sites between week 11 - 2012 and week 35 - 2013; 22 % of the visits were for fever syndromes and 23 % of the cases of fever syndrome were ILI. Influenza viruses were the second most frequent cause of ILI (20 %), after adenoviruses (21 %) and before rhinoviruses (18 %) and enteroviruses (15 %).

40|$|Introduction: Influenza is {{associated}} with illnesses such as pneumonia and other respiratory conditions and in severe cases leads to death. The prevalence of these illnesses and deaths fluctuates with the seasons during the year, {{even in the absence}} of influenza. Although many studies have focussed on mortality associated with influenza epidemics, and some have examined hospitalizations in elderly patients, there are very few studies that have examined the effect of influenza epidemics on adults or children. This study seeks to determine the association between general practitioner (GP) consultations for <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> and hospital admissions of adults and children associated with influenza epidemics. Methods: Structural Time Series Models with stochastic trend and seasonal components were developed for two age groups (children aged 0 - 15 years, and adults aged 16 - 50 years). Data from the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network on GP consultation rates for <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses,</b> and data from Swiss hospital admissions, were obtained for the period 1987 - 1996. The explanatory variables (i. e., the percentage of GP consultations for <b>influenza-like</b> <b>illnesses</b> and a 1 -week lag of this variable) were modeled against hospital admission rates for pneumonia and influenza and other respiratory conditions. Excess hospitalizations were calculated as the difference between predicted hospital admissions during influenza epidemics and expected hospital admissions in the absence of influenza epidemics. Results: In these two age groups, there was an annual average of 1452 (range: 1000 - 1700) hospital admissions directly associated with influenza epidemics. Excess admission rates were substantially higher in children (pneumonia and influenza: 4. 77 per 10 000 children per year, and other respiratory conditions: 2. 29 per 10 000 children per year) compared with adults (pneumonia and influenza: 0. 86 per 10 000 adults per year and other respiratory conditions: 0. 68 per 10 000 adults per year). The models explained 56 - 84 % of the variation in hospital admissions. The seasonal patterns were stable over the 10 years modeled and the variances of the trends were small. Conclusion: The structural time series models is an ideal approach to model influenza-related hospitalizations as the models capture trends, seasonal variation, and the association with exogenous factors.
