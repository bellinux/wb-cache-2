Following the verdict, Gerrard said he was looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> back to playing football and putting the experience behind him.|$|E
25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> to know you better.|$|E
25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the {{youngest}} of the brothers, Joe Loeffler, was dismissed from Chevelle. Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord. Pete and Sam stated the following on the band's official website: [...] "After three years of non-stop touring and recording, Joe is taking a break to be home with family. We'll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> out there and playing for the fans. See you on tour." [...] However, according to Ultimate Guitar Archive, Joe said he was fired.|$|E
500|$|According to Durst, Limp Bizkit would [...] "comb {{the world}} for the illest guitar player known to man" [...] to replace Borland. After holding a {{nationwide}} audition for a new guitarist, [...] "Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is", the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith. [...] "Mike brought in a breath of fresh air," [...] Durst said. [...] "Creatively, it fit like a glove. It made life easier and more positive. It made us look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> together as a band so much more. The positive effect he had on me just made the whole experience of Limp Bizkit feel like a brand-new entity." [...] Before Smith replaced Borland, Durst played a great deal of guitar. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit jammed with four finalists after their much-publicized guitarist audition tour, but now it looks like Fred Durst might be taking a cue from his Puddle of Mudd pal Wes Scantlin and handling both vocal and guitar duties himself." ...|$|E

It was also announced that Dugdale would speak for Labour at First Minister's Questions. Lamont did not have a place in the new cabinet, but Murphy stated that she had not wanted one: [...] "Johann and I have been in touch with one another; she has wished me well. I'm looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> together with her, but Johann wasn't looking for a job in today's reshuffle. I think Johann will be {{a big part of the}} Scottish Labour Party for years to come".|$|E

We are really proud of all the music we’ve made together and look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> together to smash out The Neon Handshake. The early 2000s were exciting times for British rock music. It was a special time for our bands, who toured together and forged strong friendships.

2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> up to Sydney. It's a great footy club and, as I said, I had to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to the boys is something very tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Hammond was {{completing}} a seventh and final run to collect extra footage for the programme when his front-right tyre failed, and, according to witness and paramedic Dave Ogden, [...] "one of the parachutes had deployed {{but it went}} on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100yards from us." [...] The emergency crew quickly arrived at the car, finding it inverted and partially embedded in the grass. During the roll, Hammond's helmet had embedded itself into the ground, flipping the visor up and forcing soil into his mouth and damaging his left eye. Rescuers felt a pulse and heard the unconscious Hammond breathing before the car was turned upright. Hammond was cut free with hydraulic shears, and placed on a backboard. [...] "He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain". He was then transported by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the neurological unit of the Leeds General Infirmary. Hammond's family visited him at the hospital along with Top Gear co-presenters James May and Jeremy Clarkson. Clarkson wished Hammond well, saying [...] "Both James and I are looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> our 'Hamster' back", referring to Hammond by his nickname.|$|E

60|$|The {{vice-consul}} was {{not sure}} how far his powers went in the situation with which Mrs. Lander had finally embarrassed him.

She had never spoken of such a chance, but had always looked <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> well and going home, so far as the girl knew, and the most careful search now brought to light nothing that bore upon it. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, they did what they must, and the body, emptied of its life of senseless worry and greedy care, was laid to rest in the island cemetery of Venice.|$|E

So 'ee goes on, and his woife doan't care about taking pains about a house when t' maister ain't never at home but to his meals, and his children get to look for him coming home drunk and smashing the things, and when he gets old he's just a broken-down drunkard, wi'out a penny saved, and nowt but the poorhouse before him.
