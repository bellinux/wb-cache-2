But their dispute mirrored more than individual ambition.” Both were known for the colorful red berets they wore. There were reports that Thi was showing insubordination towards Kỳ. The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, said that Thi once refused to report to Kỳ in Saigon when requested. On one occasion, Kỳ came to I Corps to remonstrate with him in early March, Thi addressed his staff and asked mockingly, “Should we pay attention to this <b>funny</b> <b>little</b> man from Saigon or should we ignore him?” Thi made this comment rather loudly, within earshot of Kỳ, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that the prime minister viewed Thi's comment as a direct challenge to his authority.|$|E
500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, then you start to hear a <b>funny</b> <b>little</b> word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The <b>Funny</b> <b>Little</b> Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E

[...] Thi made this comment rather loudly, within earshot of Ky, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that Kỳ viewed Thi's comment as a direct and calculated challenge to his authority. Time said Thi [...] "ran it [...] like a warlord of yore, obeying those edicts {{of the central government}} that suited him and blithely disregarding the rest". Of the four corps commanders, Thi was seen as the one with the most power and independence from Saigon. Kahin thought Kỳ may have feared that Thi would secede from Saigon and turn central Vietnam into an independent state. The CIA analyst Douglas Pike, who worked in Vietnam, speculated that this would have been a large part of Ky's thinking, as Vietnamese people have often had strong regional tendencies.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} series {{needs to find}} a way to {{distinguish}} Leslie from Steve Carell's Michael Scott from The Office, but he said the pilot episode was funny, particularly the Aziz Ansari character. Sepinwall also said The Office did not find its footing until the second season, so comparisons simply based on the pilot were not fair. (Ironically, most critics now agree that Parks and Recreation set a significantly higher standard after the second season.) Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the supporting cast needed stronger writing and reinforcements, but that Poehler was excellent in a lead role unique for women because it is based on weakness and wrongheadedness, but still a positive and strong part. Stanley said, [...] "The pilot episode isn’t perfect, but Ms. Poehler very nearly is." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday said Poehler has [...] "plenty of appeal here" [...] so he felt the show might have potential, but felt the pilot was for the most part a [...] "near knockoff" [...] of The Office. Likewise, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times said [...] "so far it's a pale Xerox of the paper company", although she said [...] "there are lots of <b>funny</b> <b>little</b> moments that could add up to a great series." [...] Robert Bianco said the episode was not funny, and the way in which the scripts and supporting cast ridicule and ignore the Leslie character leaves a [...] "sour whiff of gratuitous cruelty." [...] He also called the pilot unoriginal and described it as [...] "a style in search of a show," [...] despite Poehler's likability. Similarly, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "Watching Poehler's pathetic character have her dreams stomped on by apathetic bureaucrats is off-putting, more so than Michael Scott's obliviousness," [...] although Owen said the Ansari character was amusing.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott of IGN {{reviewed}} most of Lost: Missing Pieces and {{has given}} each a rating out of ten. [...] After four mobisodes aired, he remarked that [...] "these vignettes feel like your average deleted scene—removed {{for a good}} reason"; however, no mobisode received a score less than 6.5. [...] "The Watch" [...] scored a 7.5 and was called [...] "touching" [...] because Jack and his father have rarely been seen getting along in Lost. [...] "The Adventures of Hurley and Frogurt" [...] was given a 6.5 and described as [...] "a <b>funny</b> <b>little</b> moment" [...] and [...] "tragic", in regard to Libby's death. [...] "King of the Castle" [...] received an 8.5. [...] Carabott {{said that it was}} well written, [...] "a great performance from [...] " [...] and worthy of appearing on television. [...] Carabott celebrated Michael's return in [...] "The Deal", but the reviewer noted that [...] "The Deal" [...] "doesn't reveal anything new or exciting at all". [...] "Operation: Sleeper" [...] was rated as a 7.5, as was [...] "Buried Secrets". [...] "Room 23" [...] got an 8 and was described as [...] "definitely the type of new content that we are looking for. [...] It's something that won't be missed by regular viewers but gives a little more insight into the nature of events on the island". [...] "Arzt and Crafts" [...] also got an 8 and was said to have [...] "a cleverly devised title" [...] and was [...] "packed with a healthy amount of humor". [...] "Tropical Depression" [...] received an 8.5, with Carabott calling it [...] "rather pointless ... but cute nonetheless". [...] "Jack, Meet Ethan. [...] Ethan? [...] Jack" [...] scored an 8 and Mapother's acting skills were commended. [...] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course" [...] was deemed [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "one of [...] funniest ... moments" [...] and worthy of a 7.5. [...] "The Envelope" [...] was given a 6.5, and [...] "So It Begins" [...] was given a 9—the highest score of any mobisode—and was described as [...] "a shocking new look at the Christian Shephard who appeared to Jack".|$|E

2500|$|There {{were reports}} that Thi was showing insubordination towards Kỳ.

[...] Thi made this comment rather loudly, within earshot of Kỳ, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that the prime minister viewed Thi’s comment as a direct challenge to his authority. In Vietnam, newspapers critical {{of the government of}} the day were routinely shut down so that only mouthpieces were left speaking, and many political leaders erroneously assumed that the US operated in the same manner. As a result, they often interpreted negative US media reports as the official position of Washington and thus encouragement of a coup.|$|E
