40|$|The use {{of ceramic}} matrix {{composites}} (CMCs) as combustor liners and turbine vanes provides {{the potential of}} improving next-generation turbine engine performance, through lower emissions and higher cycle efficiency, relative to today s use of superalloy hot-section components. For example, the introduction of film-cooling air in metal combustor liners has led {{to higher levels of}} nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the combustion process. An <b>environmental</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>coated</b> (EBC) siliconcarbide- fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composite is a new material system that can operate at higher temperatures, significantly reducing the film-cooling requirements and enabling lower NOx production.

As part of the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program, the High Pressure Burner Rig (HPBR) at the NASA Glenn Research Center was selected to demonstrate coupon, subcomponent feature, and component testing because it can economically provide the temperatures, pressures, velocities, and combustion gas compositions that closely simulate the engine environments.

40|$|Modeling {{of thermal}} {{residual}} stress in <b>environmental</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>coated</b> fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composites Ali Abdul-Aziz 1, 2 and Ramakrishna T Bhatt 1, 3 For SiC/SiC composites to replacemetallic materials in future turbine engines, prime reliant <b>environmental</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings (EBCs) are required. However, {{due to the}} mismatch in thermal expansion and elastic modulus between the substrate and the coating, thermal residual stresses are generated in the coating after processing as well as during exposure to turbine engine operating conditions. The nature and magnitude of the thermal stresses will {{have a profound effect}} on the durability and reliability of the EBC. To estimate the magnitude of in-plane (x- and y-directions) and through-the-thickness (z-direc-tion) thermal residual stresses in the coating, a finite element model (FEM) was developed. Using FEM, the residual stresses were predicted for three multilayered EBC systems considered for the SiC/SiC composites: (1) barium strontium alumi-num silicate, (2) ytterbium disilicate, and (3) ytterbiummonosilicate. Influence of thickness and modulus of the coating layer on the thermal residual stress were modeled. Results indicate that thermal residual stresses in the SiC/SiC composite substrate are compressive and in all the three coatings tensile. Further examination indicates that in the z-direction, tensile stresses in all three systems are negligible, but in-plane tensile stresses can be significant depending on the composition of the constituent layer and the distance from the substrate. Comparison of predicted thermal residual stresses in the three systems shows that the ytterbium monosilicate system has the highest stress (~ 395 MPa), while the other two systems averaged about 80 MPa in one of the coating layers. A parametric analysis conducted indicates that lowering the modulus of the coating can lower the thermal residual stresses...|$|R

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study using}} a two-flux approximation of the radiative transfer equation {{was performed to}} examine the effects of an opaque reflective layer on the thermal behavior of a typical semitransparent thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> on an opaque substrate. Some ceramic materials are semitransparent in the wavelength ranges where thermal radiation is important. Even with an opaque layer on each side of the semitransparent thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating,</b> scattering and absorption can have an effect on the heat transfer. In this work, a thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> that is semitransparent up to a wavelength of 5 micrometers is considered. Above 5 micrometers wavelength, the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> is opaque. The absorption and scattering coefficient of the thermal barrier was varied. The thermal behavior of the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with an opaque reflective layer is compared to a thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> without the reflective layer. For a thicker thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with lower convective loading, which would be typical of a combustor liner, a reflective layer can significantly decrease the temperature in the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> and substrate if the scattering is weak or moderate and for strong scattering if the absorption is large. The layer without the reflective coating can be about as effective as the layer with the reflective coating if the absorption is small and the scattering strong. For low absorption, some temperatures in the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> system can be slightly higher with the reflective layer. For a thin thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with high convective loading, which would be typical of a blade or vane that sees the hot sections of the combustor, the reflective layer is not as effective. The reflective layer reduces the surface temperature of the reflective layer for all conditions considered.
