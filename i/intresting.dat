Wavelet and Neural networks provide very <b>intresting</b> results, especially when compared with classical methods. A hierarchical architecture is proposed, with a #rst network used as a parametric modeler of the Jominy pro#le, and a second one estimating parameters from the steel chemical composition. Suitable data preprocessing helps to reduce network size. Keywords: Neural Networks, Wavelet Networks, Jominy pro#les, steel manufacturing. 1 Introduction Hardenability is a basic feature of steels: in order to characterise it, manufacturers usually perform the so-called Jominy end-quench test # 1 #, which consists in measuring the hardness along a specimen of a heat-treated steel, at prede#ned positions; the measured values form the Jominy hardness pro#le. Hardenability depends on chemical composition in a partially unknown fashion, therefore black-box models have been [...] ...|$|E

The metod used in this study is the qualitative semi-structured interviews with four preschool teachers. The theoretical ground used to perform the analyse in the study is represented by socio-cultural perspective and hermeneutic research effort.   The study shows that the interaction between children is the same in all environments but that the interaction between children and the environment might be different depending on the development and <b>intrests</b> of the preschool children. The survey shows that this interaction between children and the environment begins before the bus week and that the starting point in the interaction can be expressed by <b>intrest,</b> bus destinations and preschool topic.

(An Ala- 237 Thr mutation had previously been shown to increase activity on cephems by about 30 – 80 %. ^(1, 2)) Screening of all 19 possibles mutants on penams and cephems revealed the even more active Ala- 237 Asn mutant. Detailed kinnetic analysis showns that this mutant has about four times the activity toward cephalothin and cephalosporin C as the wild-type enzyme. Both mutations reduce the activity toward penams to about 10 % that of RETM- 1 β-lactamase and lower by about 5 °C the tempreature at which the enzyme denatures. Functional properties of the other mutants have also been surveyed. The most <b>intresting</b> aspect of these results is that two quite disparate amino acids, theronine and asparagine, when intorduced for Ala- 237, cause such similar changes in enzyme specificity while more similar residues do not alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme to such a significant degree...|$|E

Muslim scholars see Hadis {{as the source of}} Islam that came from the Prophet Muhammad – peace be upon him. It is the sayings or statements, doings, and approvals of the Prophet, meanwhile according to Orientalists, hadis was made by muslim community in the first and second age of Higra.
