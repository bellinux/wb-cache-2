40|$|We built a {{researcher}} <b>identifier</b> <b>management</b> system called the Researcher Name Resolver (RNR) {{to assist with}} the name disambiguation of authors in digital libraries on the Web. RNR, which is designed to cover all researchers in Japan, is a Web-oriented service that can be openly connected with external scholastic systems. We expect it to be widely used for enriched scholarly communications. In this paper, we first outline the conceptual framework of RNR, which is jointly focused on researcher <b>identifier</b> <b>management</b> and Web resource linking. We based our researcher identifier scheme on the reuse of multiple sets of existing researcher identifiers belonging to the Japanese grant database KAKEN and the researcher directory ReaD & Researchmap. Researcher identifiers are associated by direct links to related resources on the Web through a combination of methods, including descriptive mapping, focused crawling on campus directories and researcher identification by matching names and affiliations. Second, we discuss our implementation of RNR based on this framework. Researcher identifiers construct uniform resource identifiers to show Web pages that describe researcher profiles and provide links to related external resources. We have adapted Web-friendly technologies—e. g., OpenSearch and the RDFs of Linked Data technology—in this implementation to provide Web-friendly services. Third, we discuss our application of RNR to a name disambiguation task for the search portal of the Japanese Institutional Repositories Online to determine how well the researcher <b>identifier</b> <b>management</b> system cooperates with external systems. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the entire project as well as the future development directions we intend to take...|$|E

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how geographic and environmental information created and maintained by different organisations in Europe can be embedded in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) and reused in various applications by different people. The main challenge related to this task is to deal with the heterogeneity of data managed by others. The core concept of SDIs is interoperability, which “means the possibility for spatial data sets to be combined and for services to interact, without repetitive manual intervention, {{in such a way that}} the result is coherent and the added value of the data sets and services is enhanced”. INSPIRE, which is used as the main SDI initiative from which this report draws its examples and best practices, is built on the existing standards, information systems and infrastructures, professional and cultural practices of 27 Member States of the European Union in more than 23 languages. The main part of this report describes the conceptual framework for the development of interoperability specifications that define the targets to which existing data should be transformed. The conceptual framework is composed of two fundamental parts: the Generic Conceptual Model (GCM) and the methodology for data specification development. The GCM defines 26 aspects or elements for achieving data interoperability in an SDI. These include registers and registries, coordinate reference systems, <b>identifier</b> <b>management,</b> metadata, maintenance, to name just a few. The description of the methodology for developing data specifications for interoperability includes a detailed discussion of the relevant actors, steps and the overall workflow – from capturing user requirements to documenting and testing the specifications that emerge from this process. The GCM and the methodology together help to understand the organisational and technical aspects how the data component of an SDI can be established, how interoperability arrangements, data standardisation and harmonisation contribute to this process. Since 2005 INSPIRE has been pioneering the introduction, development, and application of a conceptual framework for establishing the data component in an SDI. This experience shows that the conceptual framework described in this report is robust enough to reinforce interoperability across the 34 data specifications developed for the infrastructure. Moreover, because the framework is platform and theme independent, able to deal with the cultural diversity, and based on best practice examples from Europe and beyond, it may provide solutions for SDI challenges in other environments too.

40|$|The loud chorus {{songs of}} the group-living lemur Indri indri are a {{striking}} feature of rainforest areas of eastern Madagascar. Despite some research on the conspicuous vocal display of the indri, two hypotheses have not been addressed: do groups differ in the acoustic properties of their songs, and is there evidence of coordinated singing between individuals within groups. We recorded and analyzed the songs of three indri groups to examine these two questions. To answer the first question, we made quantitative spectral measures on {{songs of the}} three groups and performed multivariate analyses of the acoustic features of the notes constituting the songs. Our results showed songs {{of the three groups}} differed significantly, although there was overlap between groups. To answer the second question, we classified note types and quantified their occurrence as overlapping and abutting pairs. We found non-random associations between sequential note types in all three indri groups. These associations were consistent among groups, suggesting that individuals follow consistent answering rules when contributing to choruses. Whether indris use acoustic group <b>identifiers</b> in <b>management</b> of behavioral strategies and how within-group coordinated note production might function remain unknown.

40|$|Vehicular Communication (VC) network {{technology}} {{is in the}} verge of real world deployment. The technology is aimed at achieving high levels of traffic efficiency security and comfort for the users of the traffic system. The technology facilitates exchange of awareness and notification messages among the vehicles to improve the traffic efficiency and safety of the drivers. However, deployment of this awesome technology faces several security and privacy risks. The system is subjected to security risks like replay attacks, nodes sending false information to the system, denial of service attacks by clogging the networks. System also faces several privacy challenges in which sensitive user data can be eavesdropped and also tracing out a particular node using the location data sent by the node. In this research we focused on protecting {{the privacy of the}} users using the VC system. Several European projects have been working on privacy enhancement techniques for VC environments. Privacy policy enforcement approach from Privacy Enabled Capability In Co-Operative Systems and Safety Applications (PRECIOSA), pseudonym approach from Secure Vehicular Communication (SeVeCom) and Preparing secure V 2 X Communication Systems (PRESERVE) project which integrates the results from both PRECIOSA and SeVeCom projects are three of those projects considered in this report. This research is more focused on the pseudonym approach proposed by SeVeCom. We discuss the impact of pseudonym change on the communication stack, what other lower layer identifiers need to be changed along with the pseudonym change, and is there any other ways the attacker can still link the messages from a particular node to hamper the nodes privacy. Finally after analyzing the results from the research, we propose a solution to include a new module in the PRESERVE architecture called <b>Identifier</b> Change <b>Management</b> (IDCM) module to improve the anonymity of the user participating in the vehicular communication...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an extension plan on the rate of adoption of technological practices in small-scale livestock producers, the modi operandi of the producers in terms of the technological practices they use and the effects on the system productivity. A hundred and one small-scale sheep farmers were included in the study. A survey with 36 closed questions was performed in September 2010 and repeated in December 2012. Five indicators of productivity were constructed, and the use of technological fifteen practices for sheep production in the study area was recorded. After analyzing and comparing data, it was found that the extension plan executed modified the set of technological practices used by sheep producers of this territory. It was also seen that the frequency of use of all technological practices evaluated set a "fingerprint " pattern that can be used as an <b>identifier</b> of technological <b>management</b> formats within a group of producers. In addition, extension generated homogenization of the productivity indicators, although notable differences between groups in the number and frequency of technological practices persisted, which greatly favored the lower technological complexity groups, to the detriment of more technologies producers. Finally, the extension plan improved the average productivity as a result of effective incorporation of technological practices that were not used or were used at low frequencies.

40|$|The {{health status}} of the Irish Traveller ethnic {{minority}} is low compared {{to the general population}} in Ireland in terms of infant mortality rates and life expectancies. Respiratory disease is an area of health disparity manifested as excess mortalities in Traveller males and females. In this study, we examined the available data with regard to tuberculosis (TB) notifications in Ireland from 2002 to 2013. We found an increase in TB notifications in Irish Travellers from 2010 onwards. This resulted in a crude incidence rate for TB in Irish Travellers that was about threefold higher than that of the white Irish-born population in 2011 and 2012. An outbreak of TB in Irish Travellers in 2013 increased this differential further, but when outbreak-linked cases were excluded, a higher incidence rate was still observed in Irish Travellers relative to the general population and to white Irish-born. The mean age of a TB patient was 26 years in Irish Travellers compared to 43 years in the general population, and 49 years in white Irish-born. Based on available data, Irish Travellers exhibit a higher incidence rate and younger age distribution of TB compared to white Irish-born and the general population. These observations emphasize the importance of routine use of ethnicity <b>identifiers</b> in the <b>management</b> of TB and other notifiable communicable illnesses in Ireland. They also have implications for the orientation of preventive services to address health disparities in Irish Travellers and other ethnic minority groups.

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Quality in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 Many top performing businesses, which achieve superior levels of success and sustainability, have a sound, implemented, and well maintained, Quality Management System (QMS). The correlation between business success and an implemented management system {{has been shown in}} numerous papers. This research, which culminates in a quantitative measure of QMS performance, was conducted at Eskom’s Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS). The power station is the operating leg of the Koeberg Operating Unit (KOU). The researcher is a QMS lead auditor in the KNPS Quality Assurance Department. A program of audits is planned based on the KOU quality and safety manual and the national regulatory licencing requirements. The audit monitoring program is then implemented over a three year period and considers all the management system processes which impact on nuclear safety and business performance. The individual audits each consider ISO 9001 criteria in context of the business area audited. Each major business area (e. g. design, maintenance, etc.) within the power station adheres to all generic ISO 9001 QMS clauses and considerations, such as documentation management, records management, etc. Each process or business area audit is thus effectively a QMS audit. The audit results, when combined are therefore a representative measure of the overall organisational QMS performance. The potential value to be gained from the audit results and data accrued over the monitoring period has not been optimised to maximise the return on investment to Eskom. The research problem statement thus proposes that the performance measurement capability of the quality management system at Eskom's Koeberg Power Station is insufficient. This diminishes management's ability to identify business risk resulting from management system deficiencies, which impacts negatively on business performance. The research question seeks to determine how the performance measurement capability of the QMS can be improved to assist management in identifying business risk resulting from quality management system deficiencies in order to improve business performance. The research objectives are supported by the literature study, which identifies the quality management methods currently used in order to measure and subsequently improve business performance. It also shows how QMS performance measurement, when deconstructed and analysed can provide the required insight for supporting management decision making. The research approach is considered inductive in that a theory is developed based on the collection and the analysis of that data. Applied research, will thus serve as the basis of the research methodology as it is considered the most appropriate research approach, based on the need to answer practical questions around the measurement of QMS performance philosophy. The research shows that by introducing additional theming and severity data into the secondary audit findings data, it is possible over time to extract high level strategic direction information when analysing the additional metadata. The dimensions and value of the QMS Performance measuring instrument are: Ø A cause and effect theming philosophy of audit findings providing an additional context to business improvement advice to management. Ø The provision of a QMS process deficiency locator / <b>identifier</b> which targets <b>management</b> action areas for improvement. Ø The provision of a quantitative measure of the management system performance, providing a reference from which to improve. By providing a quantifiable measure of an organisations QMS performance, a reference point is provided to gauge QMS performance and also render a definitive measure to enable performance improvement of the business...|$|R
40|$|To support {{emerging}} online {{activities within}} the digital information infrastructure, such as commerce, healthcare, entertainment and scientific collaboration, {{it is increasingly}} important to verify and protect the digital identity of the individuals involved. Identity management systems manage the digital identity life cycle of individuals which includes issuance, usage and revocation of digital <b>identifiers.</b> ^ Identity <b>management</b> systems have improved the management of identity information and user convenience; however they do not provide specific solutions to address protection of identity from threats such as identity theft and privacy violation. One major shortcoming of current approaches {{is the lack of}} strong verification techniques for issuance and usage of digital identifiers. In the absence of verification mechanisms, digital identifiers can be misused to commit identity theft. Another shortcoming is the inability of individuals to disclose minimal data while satisfying strong identity verification requirements. The extraneous data collected can potentially be aggregated or used in a manner that would lead to violation of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s privacy. Finally, current identity management systems do not consider biometric and history-based identifiers. Such identifiers are increasingly becoming an integral part of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s identity. Such types of identity data also need to be used with other digital identifiers and protected against misuse. ^ In this thesis we introduce a number of techniques that address the above problems. Our approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factor identity verification. The technique consists of verifying multiple identifier claims of an individual, without revealing extraneous identity information. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that we employ identity protection and verification techniques in all stages of the identity life cycle. We also enhance our approach with the use of biometric and history-based identifiers. In particular we provide the following key contributions: (1) A new cryptographic primitive referred to as aggregate proof of knowledge to achieve privacy preserving multi-factor verification. This primitive uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. Our cryptographic scheme is better in terms of the performance, flexibility and storage requirements than existing efficient ZKPK techniques that may be used to prove, under zero-knowledge, the knowledge of multiple secrets. (2) Algorithms to generate biometric keys reliably from an individual 2 ̆ 7 s biometric images. These keys are used to create biometric commitments that are subsequently used to perform multi-factor identity verification using ZKPK. Several factors, including various traditional identity attributes, can thus be used in conjunction with one or more biometrics of the individual. We also ensure security and privacy of the biometric data and show how the biometric key is not revealed even if all the data, including cryptographic secrets, stored at the client machine are compromised. (3) A series of protocols for the establishment and management of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s transaction history-based identifiers encoded as receipts from e-commerce transactions. These receipt protocols satisfy the security and privacy requirements related to the management of the electronic receipts. We also demonstrate how the users receipt protocols can be employed in the context of mobile phones. In particular we provide techniques to manage the portable identity information on such devices, and use them at physical locations of the service providers. ...|$|R
40|$|Personalization of Internet {{services}} is a signiﬁcant feature and exploiting the users’ location brings the most value to it. Location-based services {{have a wide}} application range – from emergency, tracking, and navigation services to informational and entertainment services. In existing centrally managed solutions, the results of location-based search are often incomplete or outdated. Additional information about the searched object (e. g. the menu, facilities, prices) is usually not available, as such {{a huge amount of}} data and frequent updates (e. g. the number of free places in restaurant) would overload the server. In a peer-to-peer solution, each peer is responsible for the information about the object it represents, therefore, updating and publishing information is done directly without a single point of failure. It is available to a wide community to join and publish their services, as peer-to-peer systems operate at low costs. The main goal of this thesis is to prove the feasibility of engineering a peer-to-peer solution for fully retrievable location-based search. Following an engineering approach, we ﬁrst examine the most used and referred overlays of different types (unstructured, structured, and hybrid). Comparative evaluation identiﬁes the inﬂuence of their design decisions on quality aspects such as efﬁciency, scalability, robustness, and stability. The foundation for the design of our solution is based on the ﬁndings from this study. The resulting overlay, Globase. KOM is a structured superpeer-based overlay {{in the form of a}} tree enhanced with interconnections. Superpeers are chosen from publicly reachable, static peers with more capacity, spare bandwidth, and good network connectivity. The world projection is divided into rectangular zones, which do not overlap. Each zone is assigned to a superpeer, located inside this zone. It is responsible for all peers in the zone. Superpeers form the tree, which is based on the subset-relation of their zones. Further contribution is the clear methodology for evaluating peer-to-peer search overlays, by deﬁning metrics and various workloads that address all crucial quality properties. Additionally, in order to model realistic workloads, we discuss the difference between user behavior in popular ﬁle-sharing applications and VoIP applications such as Skype. As an evaluation tool, we select the simulation framework PeerfactSim. KOM and extend it to support various geographical distribution of peers on a world map and a location-aware churn model. The evaluation results prove the efﬁciency, good load balancing, scalability, robustness, and stability of the system. Query resolution is signiﬁcantly faster than in related solutions. Additionally, the location-awareness of the overlay results in an efﬁcient mapping of the logical overlay to the physical underlay which reduced total transmission delay and unnecessary underlay trafﬁc. Although uneven load distribution seems to be an issue due to the tree structure of the overlay, we prove very good load balance due to interconnections and a careful zone formation, which together diminish a higher expected overload of superpeers in the higher tree levels. Our solution scales logarithmically with growing network size. It proves to be robust and stable under simultaneous failures of superpeers in higher tree levels, or in the same branch of the tree, and in the case of frequent querying. The biggest inﬂuence on the quality of our solution is the choice of <b>identiﬁer</b> space, its <b>management,</b> and interconnections. A peer identiﬁer contains the information responsibility and its location. That allows smart selection of interconnections and efﬁcient greedy routing. Interconnections enable bypassing of the superpeers in higher levels of the tree and therefore allow equal load distribution among the superpeers. A fast recovery time and small performance variation under extreme churn and critical failures is to be credited to the various maintenance strategies used in combination. The simulation results are conﬁrmed by a prototype and its applicability is shown in the examples of distributed multimedia communication and future peer-to-peer based collaborative applications...|$|R
