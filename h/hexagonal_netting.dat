A crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis for Zn−Zn contacts in EuZn 2 suggests a possible homogeneity width for the KHg 2 -type phase, which is indicated from analysis of X-ray powder diffraction patterns. Total electronic energy comparisons, as well as density of states (DOS) and COHP analysis for a hypothetical Zn-rich compound, Eu(Zn 0. 75 Ge 0. 25) 2, indicate that two distinct phases, KHg 2 -type EuZn 2 and AlB 2 -type Eu(Zn 1 −xGex) 2 (0. 5 ≤ x ≤ 0. 70), are more favorable than a single Zn-rich composition adopting the AlB 2 -type phase. Among 10 structural models of Eu(Zn 0. 5 Ge 0. 5) 2, the one with heteroatomic Zn−Ge interactions both within and perpendicular to the 63 nets is energetically the most favorable structure. The experimentally observed Zn−Ge bond distance is attributed to the contribution of both σ- and π-bond interactions. Zn−Ge, Eu−Zn, and Eu−Ge COHP curves of the minimum energy form of Eu(Zn 0. 5 Ge 0. 5) 2 show bonding character above the Fermi level and explain the observed wide homogeneity width of the AlB 2 -type phase. In the Ge-rich case, Eu(Zn 0. 25 Ge 0. 75) 2, the planar <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nets</b> are not energetically favorable due to the significant antibonding character of Ge−Ge bonding at the Fermi level.

30|$|The {{percolation}} {{threshold for}} experimental data {{was less than}} any of the two models with regular nets. This means that stresses in natural soil are not transmitted only by the contact between grains, represented as nodes in the nets. It is conjectured that inter-particles sliding, associated to the viscous effect, traditionally neglected, is responsible for the difference. The shift of the percolation threshold is necessarily associated to the viscous effect which, in turn, is due to the different relaxation times for the two soil phases, the solid phase and the liquid phase. In the models, the liquid phase was not considered, thus the percolation threshold coincides with the percolation threshold for squared and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nets.</b> In laboratory tests, since the liquid phase was not isolated, it was included in the percolation process.

40|$|TRIM 5 {{proteins}} are restriction {{factors that}} block retroviral infections by binding viral capsids and preventing reverse transcription. Capsid recognition is mediated by C-terminal domains on TRIM 5 α (SPRY) or TRIMCyp (cyclophilin A), which interact weakly with capsids. Efficient capsid recognition also requires the conserved N-terminal tripartite motifs (TRIM), which mediate oligomerization and create avidity effects. To characterize how TRIM 5 proteins recognize viral capsids, we developed methods for isolating native recombinant TRIM 5 proteins and purifying stable HIV- 1 capsids. Biochemical and EM {{analyses revealed that}} TRIM 5 proteins assembled into <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nets,</b> both alone and on capsid surfaces.

Small diameter carbon nanotubes are found to favour relatively low symmetry "ladder" and "hinged" structures, which can both be considered as formed from sections of square net sheet, in contrast to cylindrical geometries favoured when filling fixed carbon tubes.

Our formula agrees well with experimental data for both Ag and Cu{ 111 } surfaces, indicating that NN interactions alone can account for the data in these cases (in contrast to results for Cu{ 001 }). Experimentally significant corollaries of the low-temperature derivation show that the step line tension cannot be extracted from the stiffness and that with plausible assumptions the low-temperature stiffness should have six-fold symmetry, in contrast to the three fold symmetry of the crystal shape. We examine Zia's exact implicit solution in detail, using numerical methods for general orientations and deriving many analytic results including explicit solutions in the two high-symmetry directions. From these exact results we rederive our simple result and explore subtle behavior near close-packed directions.

When the sample bias is positive {{with respect to the}} tip, we observe a hexagonal symmetry in which all the atoms of the graphite surface plane are imaged. This is in contrast to the threefold symmetry usually seen in atomic-resolution STM images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), which we also observe on a reference sample of HOPG. The threefold symmetry is attributed to the ABAB stacking of the atomic layers in HOPG. In GIC’s, this stacking sequence is interrupted by the intercalate layer, so that for the stage- 1 compound all carbon atoms in the plane become equivalent, and sixfold symmetry develops. When the sample is biased negatively with respect to the tip, we observe a strikingly different STM image for the GIC; we believe that the pattern in this case is mainly due to the intercalate layer and the change in the electronic structure of graphite resulting from the presence of the intercalate layer.

Recently {{synthesized}} β”-(BEDT-TTF) 4 NH 4 [Cr (C 2 O 4) 3]⋅DMF [1] single crystals {{represent a}} compound {{that could be}} considered as a material for spintronics since crystals of this type possess giant magnetoresistance and, under condition of magnetic ordering in the subsystem of localized spins, could be an analog of heterostructures providing spin polarization of conduction electrons emitted from the magnetic layer to the conducting one [2]. This makes investigation of interactions between conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments in crystals to be attractive. The purpose of the presented work was in design of the conditions for separation of contributions of localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons into magnetic properties of single crystals of the mentioned compound as well as in an attempt of finding and investigation of mutual influence of s- and conduction π-electrons.

Communicating channels between two adjoining cells supposedly form along the common axis of two apposed hexameric trans-membrane protein assemblies. These double hexamers are often arranged in large plaques on an ordered <b>hexagonal</b> <b>net</b> (8 - 9 nm lattice constant) and seem able to undergo structural alteration {{as a possible}} permeability control mechanism. Calcium is widely reported to uncouple {{gap junction}}, and we observed this alteration on exposure to Ca++ down to 10 (- 4) M concentration. When EGTA was added at matching concentrations, the alteration was reversible several times over one hour, but with considerable variability.

The resulting lack of contrast plus low-dose "shot" noise required digital Fourier filtering and reconstruction, but no detail was recovered below 1. 8 nm.

30|$|Although {{percolation}} models {{appeared in}} the 1950 ’s, their use in soil mechanics has been limited mainly {{to the analysis of}} hydraulic conductivity. In porous media, transport phenomenon and electric conductivity have also been studied. Nevertheless, their application to the mechanical properties of soils has been scarce. In this work, percolation theory was resorted {{to the study of the}} soil stress–strain behavior. A model of regular nets was proposed to predict the effective modulus of elasticity via micro-structural properties such as layout, size, and shape of clay particles. Specifically, and as a result of this study, it can be concluded that squared and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nets</b> can be used to model the soil stress–strain behavior of soils, compacted with natural humidity and different degrees of compactness. Nets were subjected to external loadings and it was assumed that each loop had a single elastic behavior. It was also considered that the loading transfer occurs through the contact points of grains; this approach neglects stresses of pores. Thus, a two-phase composite arises, namely, a solid phase due to clay grains and the porous phase with air inside the pores. The hybrid model (percolation-FEM) has been successfully used herein. From this study, and comparing results to reported results, the squared net seems to fit much better laboratory data for remolded soils. The prediction model was calibrated from soil elastic properties determined in the laboratory. The accuracy of the model for predicting the effective modulus of elasticity is about 72 % for a squared net and 70 % for a hexagonal one.|$|R

Furthermore, the Zn−Ge bond distance in the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>net</b> drops from 2. 5190 (3) Å to 2. 4455 (3) Å, while the anisotropy of the displacement ellipsoids significantly increases along the c direction. For x 3 ̆c 0. 50 and x 3 ̆e 0. 75, respectively, orthorhombic KHg 2 -type and trigonal EuGe 2 -type phases occur as a second phase in mixtures with an AlB 2 -type phase. Diffraction of the x = 0. 75 (2) sample shows incommensurate modulation along the c direction; a structural model in super space group P 3 m̅ 1 (00 γ) 00 s reveals puckered 63 nets. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements for two AlB 2 -type compounds show Curie−Weiss behavior above 40. 0 (2) K and 45. 5 (2) K with magnetic moments of 7. 98 (1) μB for Eu(Zn 0. 48 Ge 0. 52 (2)) 2 and 7. 96 (1) μB for Eu(Zn 0. 30 Ge 0. 70 (2)) 2, respectively, indicating a (4 f) 7 electronic configuration for Eu atoms (Eu 2 +). The Zintl−Klemm formalism accounts for the lower limit of Ge content in the AlB 2 -type phases but does not identify the observed upper limit. In a companion paper, the intrinsic relationships among chemical structures, compositions, and electronic structures are analyzed by electronic structure calculations...|$|R

New CTV-based ligands with pyridyl functional groups have been synthesised for use as multifunctional ligands in coordination networks. Resultant hydrogen bonded network structures and coordination networks show a range of chain, 2 -D and 3 -D structures with <b>hexagonal</b> 6 ³ <b>nets</b> predominating. Recent results are discussed including highly complex 3 -D networks where the molecular hosts pack in a tetrameric back-to-back fashion. Michaele J. Hardie, Ruksanna Ahmad and Christopher J.
