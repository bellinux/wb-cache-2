5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet {{it has been argued}} by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E
5|$|Charig et al. {{pointed to}} the {{presence}} of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

25|$|Belief {{in a flat}} Earth {{continued}} into the 5th century BC.

50|$|Some {{critics argue}} {{that there have been}} very few Fair trade impact studies. Griffiths (2011) says that few of the {{attempts}} made meet <b>the</b> normal standards <b>for</b> an Impact evaluation, such as comparing the before and after situation, having meaningful control groups, allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Fairtrade recruits farmers who are already better off, allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a Fairtrade cooperative receives aid from a dozen other organizations - Government Departments, Aid Agencies, donor countries, and NGOs, and allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Fairtrade may harm other farmers. Other serious methodological problems arise in sampling, in comparing prices, and from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> social projects of Fairtrade do not usually aim to produce economic benefits.|$|R

Many of the buildings that had remained from the asylum years where either destroyed or converted to suit the industrial needs of the Lumber Mill. For example, the previous laundry building had been converted into the company's titular mill. Not much is known about Park & Borrowman Lumber Mill except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company remained inactive during the First World War, resulting in one of the owner’s daughters selling the property in 1918 to Franklin A.

25|$|For the English and in {{particular}} Queen Elizabeth it was more about luck as to how England had been saved. However she was displeased with Essex <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Azores expedition was a failure as well as leaving England's coastline defenceless. The English had obtained vital information from the captured Spanish ships and prisoners. They were able to learn what was happening; the objectives and overall strategy of the Spanish armada as a whole within a few days, whilst the ships were off the English and Welsh coasts. Howard on his return was rewarded soon after by the Queen and was created Earl of Nottingham.|$|E
25|$|The true reason, then, why Hegelism {{can give}} {{no reason for}} the Time-process, i.e. <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is 'in time,' and changes continuously, {{is that it was}} {{constructed}} to give an account of the world irrespective of time and change. If you insist on having a system of eternal and immutable 'truth,' you can get it only by abstracting from those characteristics of reality, which we try to express by the terms individuality, time, and change. But you must pay the price for a formula that will enable you to make assertions that hold good far beyond the limits of your experience. And {{it is part of the}} price that you will in the end be unable to give a rational explanation of those very characteristics, which you dismissed at the outset as irrelevant to a rational explanation.|$|E
25|$|The Church's {{interest}} in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, {{when in the}} 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Julian calendar {{had fallen out of}} sync with the sky. Since the Spring equinox was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582. In 1789, the Vatican Observatory opened. It was moved to Castel Gandolfo in the 1930s and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope began making observation in Arizona, USA, in 1995.|$|E

25|$|United Airlines Flight 232: a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 {{flying from}} Denver to Chicago in 1989. The {{failure of the}} rear General Electric CF6-6 engine caused the loss of all {{hydraulics}} forcing the pilots to attempt a landing using differential thrust. 111 fatalities. Prior to the United 232 crash, {{the probability of a}} simultaneous failure of all three hydraulic systems was considered as high as a billion-to-one. However, the statistical models used to come up with this figure did not account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the cowling or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength composite materials to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low.|$|E
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would be stuck with the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes {{on to explain that}} the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E
25|$|Reconciliation {{methods can}} rely on a parsimonious or a {{probabilistic}} framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events can be fixed a priori or estimated from the data. The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through dynamic programming algorithms. In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario {{as well as the}} initial sequence alignment. More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages, reflecting the loss of efficiency of HR with phylogenetic distance, for ILS, or <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages. Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scalesmodelling independent evolution of gene fragments or recognising co-evolution of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.|$|E

25|$|During {{the public}} discussions in 2007, an {{interest}} group {{put forward a}} proposal to build a new, much larger bridge {{to the east of}} the existing harbour bridge, and demolish the latter. They argued that the new bridge, which would be about 50% longer than the existing one, could be constructed to provide for dedicated public transport (including light rail, which they claimed would allow a tripling of the total capacity in people then being moved over the existing bridge), as well as for cyclists and pedestrians. Significantly, they argued that the new bridge would more or less pay for itself, by freeing up new residential land occupied by several kilometres of motorway approaches {{in some of the most}} sought-after Auckland locations like Saint Marys Bay. The proponents claimed that the bridge would free up more than 35 hectares and open up 3.3km of shoreline, a prize which would more than make up <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plans for the Western Reclamation redevelopment would in this case find themselves partly compromised by a major motorway in its area. The proposed bridge would also be cheaper to operate, and unlike a tunnel, would not need emission vents.|$|E
25|$|From 2000–01 through 2002–03, {{regional}} rankings {{were the}} sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, {{with the top}} four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03 (the latter being UMass' first ACHA season), the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished {{the importance of the}} regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, {{growth in the number of}} ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions - Northeast, Southeast, Central and West - although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings.|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} {{source of}} inaccuracy of multiplying several relative risks, considering only positive tests, {{is that it}} tends to overestimate the total risk as compared to using likelihood ratios. This overestimation {{can be explained by}} the inability of the method to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> total risk cannot be more than 100%. This overestimation is rather small for small risks, but becomes higher for higher values. For example, the risk of developing breast cancer at an age younger than 40 years in women in the United Kingdom can be estimated at approximately 2%. Also, studies on Ashkenazi Jews has indicated that a mutation in BRCA1 confers a relative risk of 21.6 of developing breast cancer in women under 40 years of age, and a mutation in BRCA2 confers a relative risk of 3.3 of developing breast cancer in women under 40 years of age. From these data, it may be estimated that a woman with a BRCA1 mutation would have a risk of approximately 40% of developing breast cancer at an age younger than 40 years, and woman with a BRCA2 mutation would have a risk of approximately 6%. However, in the rather improbable situation of having both a BRCA1 and a BRCA2 mutation, simply multiplying with both relative risks would result in a risk of over 140% of developing breast cancer before 40 years of age, which can not possibly be accurate in reality.|$|E
