40|$|Abstract: The {{possibilities}} of adaptation and exteriorization {{of production and}} reproduction performance of Khaki Campbell stump of ducks in breeding conditions of Brazzaville in Congo have been studied. Two homogeneous groups of Khaki Campbell have been constituted. The witness group {{has been subjected to}} diet A food which is composed by local agricultural produce and products and Mineral Azoth Vitamin Complex (CMAV). Diet B is only composed by local agricultural produce and products. Without animals proteins has been administered to experimental group. The difference of weight has not been significant. Talking about the intensity of lay, a really significant difference has been recorded to ducks subjected to diet A. The egg weight in these two diets (A and B) has been similar. The consumption of food per egg has been inferior in diet A. The accumulated portions have been <b>equivalents</b> compared to <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> The carcass weight and fat liver did not record significant difference. The abdominal fat weight has been significant in diet B. This study contributes in diverse strategies of improvement of ponder growth and ducks eggs production and the development of poultry farming in Congo {{on the one hand and}} the other hand profit breeding only through local agricultural products without using the mineral azoth vitamin complex...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to determine, the {{influence}} of gender and the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> on qualitative indicators of adipose tissue. A total of 40 pigs were divided into four groups according to gender (barrows, immunocastrates, young boars and gilts). According to <b>live</b> <b>weight,</b> these individuals were divided into two groups: up to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and up from 105 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> The influence of gender and <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> on production indicators were examined as follows: daily feed consumption, average daily gain and conversion ratio, as well as colour and perforation of fat, fat content of neck, ham, loin and shoulder, fatty acid content and histology of fat cells. Daily food consumption was statistically significant with respect to gender, when the highest consumption was measured in barrows to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (3. 97 kg) and the lowest consumption was measured in gilts of the same <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (3. 09 kg). The <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> had significant effect on the average daily gain. It had been proved, that increasing daily gain grew up with <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> The lowest daily gain had the immunocastrates from 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (991. 43 g) and the highest gain had barrows of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> above 105 kg (1211. 79 g). Furthermore, it was found that the average feed conversion is reduced in pigs above 105 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> Physical quality indicators of fat were not statistically significant, however, according to the test results the lowest values of fat perforation were measured in both cases in barrows in 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (lower 40. 39 N upper 52. 79 N), indicating that barrows to 104. 9 kg of bodyweight have the most delicate fat. In the study of the fat content in the main meat parts, the most statistically significant differences were in the content of intramuscular fat between genders, namely in slaughter parts of ham and shoulder. The highest content of intramuscular fat in ham was measured in gilts to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (5. 18 %) and the lowest content in young boars to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (0. 73 %). At the shoulder, the highest intramuscular fat content was measured in barrows to 104. 9 kg (2. 86 %) of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and the lowest in gilts to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (1. 79 %). Generally, the test results shows, that barrows have the most IMF, whereas the gilts have the lowest. Regarding to fatty acids content, the most significant differences were measured in content of saturated fatty acids, where the highest percentage was measured in barrows above 105 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (52. 15 %), contrary the lowest content was measured in young boars to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (49. 2 %). Fat cells histology showed no statistical significance barrows to 104. 9 kg of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> had the largest area of fat cells, while the smallest area of fat cells was detected in young boars of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> above 105 kg. Statistical significance for other indicators have not been established...|$|R

Unadjusted mean <b>live</b> <b>weights</b> were 553 (s. d. 50), 611 (s. d. 55) and 654 (s. d. 57) kg during first, second and third parity, respectively. Estimated effect of growth during parity was 46, 52 and 23 kg for the first three parities. Mean maximum weight loss was 26, 22 and 22 kg for first, second and third parity and variation was large among individuals. Week of lactation when cows had their maximum weight loss ranged from 7 weeks in first lactation to 13 weeks in third lactation. Estimated maximum effect of pregnancy on <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> during the lactation varied from 27 to 59 kg. Phenotypic variance in <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> increased with parity.

The objective of the study was to determine <b>live</b> <b>weight,</b> dress weight and body weight loss during transportation of different sex group of pigs into the Slaughtering house. The body weight loss during pre-slaughter treatment of animals was recorded and carcass value traits were assessed in details. Relationship between pig <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and dress weight was reported as dress weight = 1. 06 + 0. 73 <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> There were significant effect of sex and transport distance on <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> at slaughter, carcass weights and dressing percentage (p< 0. 01).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} designed to investigate <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> error and analyse the effect fasting and multiple weighing has on <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> measurements were carried out. In the first experiment 24 mixed aged ewes were fasted during a 24 hour period with <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> measurements taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours fasted, with three measurements taken at each time point. At the conclusion of weighing all animals were slaughtered and their gutfill was weighed to enable calculation of their true (digesta-free) weight. In the second experiment 100 Coopworth ewes were weighed as described above on two separate occasions in May and July. On all occasion animals were individually identifiable with either visual ear tags or electronic identification tags (EID). In experiment one <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of ewes {{at the start of}} fasting ranged from 34. 4 – 79. 6 kg with a mean <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 61. 3 kg. The mean <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss displayed a curvilinear response peaking at 4. 1 ± 0. 23 kg or 6. 7 % ± 0. 348 at 24 h fasting, with a significant effect of time. The regression equations y = - 0. 0073 x² + 0. 3445 x for absolute <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss and y=- 0. 012 x²+ 0. 5636 x for proportional <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss both explained 98 % of the variation. The proportion of true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> relative to measured <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> over 24 hours fasted increased from 0. 85 ± 0. 006 to 0. 91 ± 0. 004. Despite being fasted for 24 h the animals were only able to reach 91 % of their true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> as final digesta ranged from 2. 5 - 7. 3 kg with an average of 5. 06 ± 0. 27 kg. Therefore it was determined that attaining a reliable estimation of an animal’s true body weight is unachievable when fasting them for 24 hours. In experiment two, the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 100 ewes was measured during a 24 hours fasting period with measurements taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours in May which was repeated again in July. The <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss peaked at 7. 87 % in May which was considerably greater than the maximum <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss of 3. 09 % seen in the July experiment. The difference was likely due to a difference in weather conditions, with snowy conditions in July influencing the amount of feed ingested by the animals. The relationship between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss (kg) and (%) ranking at 24 hours fasted and the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> loss (kg) and (%) at fasting times 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 for experiment 2 (May and July) was analysed. The strongest relationships were seen at 12 hours fasted: y= 0. 9878 x (R² = 0. 8976); for May, y= 0. 9567 x (R² = 0. 6623) for July when expressed in kg. As a proportion of weight loss the greatest relationship was seen at 10 hours y= 0. 716 x (R² = 0. 8578) and y= 0. 8895 x (R² = 0. 8895) for May and July respectively. Probit analysis to fit 95 % of their 24 hr weight showed no significant difference was seen between the liveweight range from 0, 2 and 4 hours fasted; 4, 6, 8 hours fasted and 6, 8, 10, 12 hours fasted. In order to analyse the effect of multiple weighing a probit analysis to determine the range in weight which 95 % of average the of three weights would fall indicated the only significant difference was at 10 hrs fasted between one weight and the average of two <b>weights.</b> In summary, <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> is a fundamental measurement which is used to monitor the production in the sheep industry. However <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> is only an estimate of an animal’s true <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> which is unable to be reliably determined even following 24 h fasting due to the variation in digesta weights. Relative to their 24 h fasted <b>live</b> <b>weights,</b> fasting improved the accuracy and precision of the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> estimate with little advantage observed when animals were fasting for periods greater than 8 h. The method of multiple weighing had minimal effect on improving accuracy regardless of fasting time...|$|R

Adjusted R 2, root mean square error, conceptual predictive criterion and Akaike information criterion were used to choose the best fitted regression model and the developed models were verified using 173 bucks of the same breed. In both sexes of young goats (0 PPI, zero or no pairs of permanent incisors), <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was significantly and strongly correlated (r= 0. 80 - 0. 90) with chest girth, body length, height at withers and neck circumference. In young female goats (0 PPI), the relationship between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and body measurements was higher than male kids. In the pooled data, significant and strong correlation (r= 0. 81 - 0. 94) between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and body measurements chest girth and body length was noted. Whereas the association between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and body measurements height at withers, rump height and pelvic width {{were found to be}} significant and moderate (r= 0. 60 - 0. 65).

Lactation number interacted with monthly trends in cow <b>live</b> <b>weight.</b> Cows lost {{weight in the}} early part of the lactation. This reduction in <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was probably because of a loss in body reserves, as suggested by a lower condition score. Cows gained <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> towards the end of lactation. The ultimate <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of cows increased with parity because of ongoing growth. The heritability (h 2) estimate for <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was high at 0. 65 ± 0. 04, albeit still within the expected range. Condition score had a medium h 2 of 0. 24 ± 0. 05. Genetic and phenotypic correlations of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> with milk yield were positive, i. e. 0. 19 ± 0. 14 and 0. 12 ± 0. 05, respectively, while correlations of condition score with milk yield were negative, i. e. - 0. 42 ± 0. 15 and - 0. 17 ± 0. 04, respectively. Although <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> could be used as an indirect indicator of feed intake and efficiency of milk production, other body conformation traits could also be used. There is a need in the South African dairy industry for a selection index based on production parameters and some traits such as <b>live</b> <b>weight,</b> condition score or specific conformation traits.

The overall <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (MeanSEM) of the African giant rats was 1. 210. 01 kg (n = 363). The <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of African giant rats captured during the rainy season (1. 170. 02 kg) was significantly lower than that during the harmattan (1. 250. 02 kg; p< 0. 01) and hot-dry (1. 230. 02 kg, p< 0. 05) seasons. The male <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of 1. 280. 01 kg was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) than that of the female (1. 140. 01 kg). Male-biased sexual size dimorphism was observed during all the seasons, but was highest during the hot-dry season. The seasonal variation in <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> may be because food was more available in the wild during the harvest (dry) seasons (harmattan and hot-dry seasons) than the planting (rainy) season. The relatively low ambient temperature and relative humidity of the harmattan season was more favourable to growth, which may account for the higher <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> recorded during the season. The sex variation in <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> may be as a result of differential growth rate/time between the sexes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to derive an {{equation}} that has the ability to model <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> of Irish dairy cows over lactation. The data set consisted of 6899 cows from 63 herds, of which 428 were from experimental herds and 6471 cows were from commercial herds. An initial examination focussed on time series techniques, as the data are of a time series nature. Splines were also examined to determine the dimensions of a model required to represent the data. As an incomplete gamma function, which was previously used to model milk yield, has been used in other studies to model <b>live</b> <b>weight,</b> various milk yield models were investigated. Finally, <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> changes between two calvings were modelled as a function of age, days in milk and pregnancy. As multicollinearity was evident in this function, the variance inflation factor was examined and principal component analysis was carried out on the variables responsible for multicollinearity. The proposed <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> model has a better fit than previous models, weak multicollinearity and the residuals are homoskedastic, independent and normally distributed.

40|$|Estimation of <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> from {{measurements}} of body dimensions {{is useful in}} many management activities with domestic animals. In present study <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was measured from 2932 female and 1037 male semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus L.) during different seasons in 1969 - 85. The age of reindeer varied between 1 day and 14 yrs. Back length (along back from second spinous process to base of tail) and chest girth (just behind front legs) were taken also from 1490 female and 510 male reindeer. The growth of reindeer from birth to adulthood was cumulative consisting of a rapid weight accretion during summers followed by a weight loss or stasis during winters. The mathematical analyses of the growth based on exponential solutions gave average values for growth of female and male reindeer. Body weight of females increased {{until the age of}} 4. 5 yrs and that of males until the age of 5. 5 yrs. During winter and spring body weight of hinds decreased 10 to 15 kg and that of stags 30 to 50 kg in different age groups. Significant linear regressions were found between <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and back length (r = 0. 809 and 0. 892), <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and chest girth (r = 0. 860 and 0. 872) and <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and combined body measure (back length + chest girth) (r = 0. 877 and 0. 941) and <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and body volume (r = 0. 905 and 0. 954, respectively) in female and male reindeer.

40|$|<b>Live</b> <b>weight</b> and 21 body {{measurements}} of 110 Thoroughbred, 75 Gidran, 109 Nonius, 97 Hungarian Sport Horse, 172 Hungarian Cold Blooded Horse and 20 Murinsulaner type adult brood mares in 28 studs were evaluated in Hungary. One way ANOVA {{was used to}} compare the genotypes. Some body measure indices were determined. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and body measurements were estimated. Regression equations were developed to estimate the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> from body measurements. Significant {{differences were found between the}} <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and 21 body {{measurements of}} different genotypes. The rank of the investigated genotypes according to <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was as follows: Hungarian Cold Blooded Horse (742. 1 kg), Murinsulaner type (649. 3 kg), Nonius (614. 9 kg), Hungarian Sport Horse (600. 9 kg), Gidran (563. 4 kg) and Thoroughbred (542. 0 kg). The results of girth measurements for the warm blooded breeds were similar to the data found in the literature. Considerable difference was found between the genotypes in body measure indices. The absolute and relative body size values prove clearly and objectively, that there are significant differences in the conformation of Thoroughbred, Gidran, Nonius, Hungarian Sport Horse, Hungarian Cold Blooded Horse and Murinsulaner type adult brood mares. The most close relationship with the <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (r= 0. 89 - 0. 92; P< 0. 01) was shown the body condition and nutritional status related measurements (heart girth, 2 nd width of rump).

40|$|Study was {{conducted}} in the regency of Minahasa to estimate horse <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> using its chest girth, body length and body volume formula (cylinder volume formula) represented by animal chest girth and body length dimensions, particularly focused in Minahasa local horses. Data on animal <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> (LW), body length (BL), chest girth (CG) and body volume were collected from 221 stallions kept by traditional household farmers. Animal body volume was calculated using cylinder volume formula with CG and BL as the components of its formula. Regression analysis was carried out for LW with all the linear body measurements. The data were classified {{on the basis of}} age. Age significantly (P 0. 05). Animal <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> was predicted by simple regression models using dependent variable (Y) of the animal <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> and independent variable (X) of the animal body measurement, either body length, chest girth, or body volume. The correlations between all pairs of measurements were highly significant (P < 0. 01) for all age groups. Regression analysis showed that <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> could be predicted accurately from body volume (R 2 = 0. 92) and chest girth (R 2 = 0. 90). Simple regression model that can be recommended to predict horse <b>live</b> <b>weight</b> based on body volume with their age groups ranging from 3 to ≥ 10 years old was as follow: <b>Live</b> <b>weight</b> (kg) = 5. 044 + 1. 87088 body volume (liters).
