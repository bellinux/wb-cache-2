50|$|The Yak-52, {{like most}} Soviet {{military}} aircraft, {{was designed to}} operate in rugged environments with minimal maintenance. One of its key features, unusual in western aircraft, is its extensive pneumatic system. Engine starting, landing gear, flaps, and wheel brakes are all pneumatically actuated. Spherical storage bottles for air, replenished by an engine driven compressor, are situated behind the rear cockpit and contents displayed on the instrument panels. The operating pressure is between 10 and 50 bars (145 and 725 psi) and an <b>emergency</b> <b>circuit</b> is reserved for lowering the undercarriage if the normal supply is exhausted or the compressor fails. Additionally both main and reserve bottles can be charged from a port {{on the ground with}} compressed air, usually from a Scuba type air bottle. The ground steering/braking arrangement, especially, takes some adjustment for flyers accustomed to hydraulics, because the aircraft uses differential braking controlled by rudder pedals and a hand operated lever on the control stick.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} a notable {{rise in the number of}} forced {{ventilated}} cable tunnel schemes in the U. K., with new construction at transmission and distribution levels. The ability to accurately calculate continuous and <b>emergency</b> <b>circuit</b> ratings for these installations is vital in ensuring that their full operational benefit can be realized. While the Electra 143 calculation method in present use is fast and easy to use, it relies on several simplifying assumptions which make it unsuitable for application to tunnels with multiple independent cable circuits. This paper details a series of modifications to the present method which allow the direct calculation of ratings for tunnels containing multiple independent cable circuits. Significant benefits can be obtained from using this approach to calculate emergency ratings in these circumstances, as demonstrated by the example calculations provided. Implementation of an axially varying ac resistance also improves the accuracy of loss calculations. A number of key tunnel design considerations are illustrated through the results of the example calculations...|$|E

40|$|In {{line with}} the key role of {{methionine}} in protein biosynthesis initiation and many cellular processes most microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to synthesize methionine de novo. Here we demonstrate that, in the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, a rare combination of stringent response-controlled CodY activity, T-box riboswitch and mRNA decay mechanisms regulate the synthesis and stability of methionine biosynthesis metICFE-mdh mRNA. In contrast to other Bacillales which employ S-box riboswitches to control methionine biosynthesis, the S. aureus metICFE-mdh mRNA is preceded by a 5 '-untranslated met leader RNA harboring a T-box riboswitch. Interestingly, this T-box riboswitch is revealed to specifically interact with uncharged initiator formylmethionyl-tRNA (tRNAi(fMet)) while binding of elongator tRNA(Met) proved to be weak, suggesting a putative additional function of the system in translation initiation control. met leader RNA/metICFE-mdh operon expression is {{under the control of}} the repressor CodY which binds upstream of the met leader RNA promoter. As part of the metabolic <b>emergency</b> <b>circuit</b> of the stringent response, methionine depletion activates RelA-dependent (p) ppGpp alarmone synthesis, releasing CodY from its binding site and thereby activating the met leader promoter. Our data further suggest that subsequent steps in metICFE-mdh transcription are tightly controlled by the 5 ' met leader-associated T-box riboswitch which mediates premature transcription termination when methionine is present. If methionine supply is limited, and hence tRNAi(fMet) becomes uncharged, full-length met leader/metICFE-mdh mRNA is transcribed which is rapidly degraded by nucleases involving RNase J 2. Together, the data demonstrate that staphylococci have evolved special mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of excess methionine. We hypothesize that this strict control might reflect the limited metabolic capacities of staphylococci to reuse methionine as, other than Bacillus, staphylococci lack both the methionine salvage and polyamine synthesis pathways.

Author Summary Prokaryote metabolism is key for our understanding of bacterial virulence and pathogenesis and it is also an area with huge opportunity to identify novel targets for antibiotic drugs. Here, we have addressed the so far poorly characterized regulation of methionine biosynthesis in S. aureus. We demonstrate that methionine biosynthesis control in staphylococci significantly differs from that predicted for other Bacillales. Notably, involvement of a T-box instead of an S-box riboswitch separates staphylococci from other bacteria in the order. We provide, for the first time, direct experimental proof for an interaction of a methionyl-tRNA-specific T-box with its cognate tRNA, and the identification of initiator (tRNA_i^fMet) as the specific binding partner is an unexpected finding whose exact function in Staphylococcus metabolism remains to be established. The data further suggest that in staphylococci a range of regulatory elements are integrated to form a hierarchical network that elegantly limits costly (excess) methionine biosynthesis and, at the same time, reliably ensures production of the amino acid in a highly selective manner. Our findings open a perspective to exploit methionine biosynthesis and especially its T-box-mediated control as putative target(s) for the development of future anti-staphylococcal therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Design-for-power {{has become}} one of the primary {{objectives}} with the continuous demand to improve the battery life of mobile devices or minimize the cooling costs of servers. To save power and mitigate thermal <b>emergencies,</b> <b>circuits</b> typically enter reduced power states when the workload is light. Voltage regulators, however, operate indifferently un-der varying workload conditions due to the lack of different operating modes. When a voltage regulator is optimized for a particular load current, significant power is dissipated during voltage conversion while delivering a different load current. Adaptive activity management of on-chip voltage regulators based upon the workload information is exploited in this paper to force each on-chip regulator to operate in its most power-efficient load current. In the proposed regulator-gating (ReGa) technique, regulators are adaptively turned on (off) when the current demand is high (low) to improve the voltage conversion efficiency. With the proposed ReGa technique, the overall voltage conversion efficiency from the battery or off-chip power supply to the output of on-chip voltage regulators is improved ∼ 3 ×...|$|R

The present work is {{concerned}} with the determination of material parameters to model the inelastic behaviour of an ASTM A 471 steel (24 CrNiMoV 14 - 6, vacuum-treated alloy steel forgings) very often utilised for turbine generator shafts, turbine rotor disks and wheels. Turboalternator shafts suffer very heavy local strain during transients and accidental <b>emergencies</b> (short <b>circuits,</b> out of phase synchronisation, etc.). The experimental work has been performed by strain controlled, completely reversed push-pull low cycle fatigue tests, at room temperature, to determine the stable hysteresis loops and the cyclic curve. The tests have been performed with a servo-hydraulic INSTRON testing machine on ASTM standard specimens. The aims of the study are the characterisation of hardening parameters for an elasto-plastic continuum model, taking into account the use of continuum damage mechanics models into design and structural integrity assessment of mechanical components. Good correlation has been found between the curves modelled by the kinematic hardening parameters and those obtained by experimental fatigue tests.

40|$|This project {{describes}} {{the integration of}} a twenty-two workstation laboratory automation system based around a track-mounted robot. The required level of operational flexibility of the overall system puts the emphasis on interfacing and controlling effectively {{a large number of}} instruments. The integration of such a large system can sometimes be tricky as off-the-shelf instruments are put near side modified commercial equipment and purpose built workstations. The automated system being developed at Rhone-Poulenc Agriculture Ltd (RPAL) automates several highly manual analytical processes following one another in a constantly varying order. The integration of such a system was carried out in collaboration with a software and a mechanical engineer. The choice of the controlsystem was made so that the variety of workstations included could be controlled by a limited number of different means. After having drawn the specifications and estimated the number of inputs/outputs needed for every station, a PLC was acquired together with four computers. Various electronics interfaces had to be built or purchased in order to fully operate the system from the controlling computers. Printed circuit boards have been designed and manufactured at Middlesex University together with many mechanical parts for different stations. This integration had {{to make sure that the}} system will operate as intended and governed by the parameters entered by the user. System's behaviour and safety in case of an error or an emergency was studied and an <b>emergency</b> stop <b>circuit</b> together with interlocks was implemented.
