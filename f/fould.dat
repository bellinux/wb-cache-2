25|$|Știrbei {{was also}} the patron of Rosa Bonheur and, from 1888, an {{organizer}} of the Auguste Feyen-Perrin collectors' committee. He built {{up the rest of}} his art collection with samples from other artists, notably Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Giulio Bergonzoli, Emilio Zocchi, and Valérie Simonin. The latter, originally an actress, was married to the playwright Gustave-Eugène <b>Fould</b> (and was as such the daughter-in-law of Bonapartist Achille <b>Fould).</b> Știrbei had been a confidant of her husband, who gave his daughter Georges Achille a male name in honor of Știrbei. Following Gustave's death in 1884, Valérie remained the Prince's close friend, so much so that in 1888 Știrbei adopted both Georges Achille and her other daughter, Consuelo <b>Fould.</b>|$|E

With regard to the Larrey barracks (1825), the majesty of the central building, [...] long and flanked by two side buildings, {{is reinforced by the}} existence of an accessible courtyard from a portal framed by two pavilions of neoclassical inspiration. The ensemble is located in the axis of the Leclerc martial walkways which concentrate memorials including the monumental equestrian statue of Marshal Foch erected in 1935.

2500|$|A {{crisis was}} precipitated when, {{just before the}} {{performance}} of Les Huguenots scheduled for 9 October, Cruvelli drew her fees and disappeared (her second [...] "Flight"), taking with her some compromising letters from M. <b>Fould.</b> A distraint was put on Cruvelli's possessions, and a forfeit of 300,000 francs was threatened, {{but she did not}} reappear for a month. La nonne sanglante was performed and was moderately successful with receipts averaging over 6,000 francs per evening, but was widely condemned for its libretto. The absence of Cruvelli prompted Verdi to threaten to cancel the première of the Sicilian Vespers, and on 6 November Roqueplan, who had run up a deficit of 900,000 francs, was asked to resign, and his adversary Louis Crosnier (former director of the Opéra-Comique) replaced him on the 11th. In October 1854 the rumour was that Cruvelli had fled to Brussels to be married to Baron Vigier, a Parisian of immense fortune.|$|E
2500|$|From 1885, when Maria died in childbirth, Știrbei {{was raising}} alone his younger children, {{including}} infant Ioana. In 1890, he married off Eliza, {{to the young}} Junimist politico and landowner, Alexandru Marghiloman. By February 1895, he was gravely ill. On March 13 (Old Style: March 1) of that year, he died unexpectedly at his Bucharest palace, and, Journal des Débats reports, was [...] "mourned not just by one party, but by the whole country." [...] The Assembly held a minute of silence in his honor. He was buried next to his father and brothers in the crypt of Buftea. The ceremony was lavish, attended by the Crown Prince Ferdinand and by Matei Vlădescu, {{on behalf of the}} king, {{as well as by the}} Catargiu cabinet and the foreign diplomats. His older brother, who had cut off his links to Romania, survived him by three decades, dying in his nineties as the owner of a château in Bécon-les-Bruyères. A patron of the arts, he had married actress Gustave Haller, adopting in 1888 her daughters Consuelo and Georges Achille <b>Fould,</b> and sponsoring their training as painters. His other brother Dimitrie left a daughter, Martha, who married in 1901 the Austrian officer Hans von Blome, later opening a literary salon in Vienna.|$|E
60|$|When Mr. Gladstone came {{to leave}} office in 1866, {{he said to}} <b>Fould</b> (July 11): “The statesmen of to-day have a new mission opened to them: the mission of substituting the concert of nations for their conflicts, and of {{teaching}} them to grow great in common, and to give to others by giving to themselves. Of this beneficent work a good share has fallen to the departments with which we have respectively been connected.” <b>Fould</b> had already deplored his loss. “I counted,” he says, “on the influence of your wise doctrines in finance, to help me in maintaining our country in that system of order and economy, of which you were setting the example.” Alas, in France and in continental Europe generally at that time, selfish material interests and their class representatives were very strong, popular power was weak; in most of them the soldier was the master. Happily for our famous chancellor of the exchequer, England was different.|$|E

40|$|IN 1945 <b>Foulds</b> mated some C 57 /BL female mice with RIII males. Some of the progeny {{of these}} matings {{developed}} mammary tumours and the sixth female {{to do so}} and a male of the same litter constituted the parents of the BR 6 strain which has been maintained by brother-sister mating ever since. <b>Foulds</b> supposed that the BR 6 strain harbours the mammary tumour virus derived from its RIII male progenitor since the virus was demonstrable in a similar C 57 x RIII hybrid bearing mammary tumours (<b>Foulds,</b> 1949 a). The tumour incidence in the strain was high from the start (<b>Foulds,</b> 1949 a). The tumours are influenced greatly by hormonal conditions; many of them in the original hybrids were readily transplantable into female recipients of the same genetic constitution or into males treated with oestrogen but grew slowly after a long latent period, or not at all, in males (<b>Foulds,</b> 1947), though this sex factor in transplantation tended to be lost in subsequent generations (<b>Foulds,</b> 1949 b). The most striking characteristic of the tumours in the BRG line was their pregnancy dependence. The tumours almost invariably first appeared during pregnancy...|$|R

[...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] <b>Fould</b> above <b>fould</b> a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E

[...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.

[...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand <b>fould</b> the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E

Thus repuls'd, our final hope [...] Is flat despair: we must exasperate [...] Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, [...] And that must end us, that must be our cure, [...] To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, [...] Though full of pain, this intellectual being, [...] Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, [...] To perish rather, swallowd up and lost [...] In the wide womb of uncreated night, [...] 150 [...] Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, [...] Let this be good, whether our angry Foe [...] Can give it, or will ever? how he can [...] Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. [...] Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, [...] Belike through impotence, or unaware, [...] To give his Enemies thir wish, and end [...] Them in his anger, whom his anger saves [...] To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? [...] Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, [...] 160 [...] Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; [...] Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, [...] What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, [...] Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? [...] What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook [...] With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought [...] The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd [...] A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay [...] Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. [...] What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires [...] 170 [...] Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage [...] And plunge us in the Flames? or from above [...] Should intermitted vengeance Arme again [...] His red right hand to plague us? what if all [...] Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament [...] Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, [...] Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall [...] One day upon our heads; while we perhaps [...] Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, [...] Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd [...] 180 [...] Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey [...] Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk [...] Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; [...] There to converse with everlasting groans, [...] Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, [...] Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. [...] Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike [...] My voice disswades; for what can force or guile [...] With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye [...] Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth [...] 190 [...] All these our motions vain, sees and derides; [...] Not more Almighty to resist our might [...] Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. [...] Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n [...] Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here [...] Chains and these Torments? better these then worse [...] By my advice; since fate inevitable [...] Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, [...] The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, [...] Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust [...] 200 [...] That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, [...] If we were wise, against so great a foe [...] Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. [...] I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold [...] And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear [...] What yet they know must follow, to endure [...] Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, [...] The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now [...] Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, [...] Our Supream Foe in time may much remit [...] 210 [...] His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd [...] Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd [...] With what is punish't; whence these raging fires [...] Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. [...] Our purer essence then will overcome [...] Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, [...] Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd [...] In temper and in nature, will receive [...] Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; [...] This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, [...] 220 [...] Besides what hope the never-ending flight [...] Of future days may bring, what chance, what change [...] Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers [...] For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, [...] If we procure not to our selves more woe. [...] Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb [...] Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, [...] Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. [...] Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n [...] We warr, if warr be best, or to regain [...] 230 [...] Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then [...] May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild [...] To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife: [...] The former vain to hope argues as vain [...] The latter: for what place can be for us [...] Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream [...] We overpower? Suppose he should relent [...] And publish Grace to all, on promise made [...] Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we [...] Stand in his presence humble, and receive [...] 240 [...] Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne [...] With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing [...] Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits [...] Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes [...] Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, [...] Our servile offerings. This must be our task [...] In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom [...] Eternity so spent in worship paid [...] To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue [...] By force impossible, by leave obtain'd [...] 250 [...] Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state [...] Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek [...] Our own good from our selves, and from our own [...] Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, [...] Free, and to none accountable, preferring [...] Hard liberty before the easie yoke [...] Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear [...] Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, [...] Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse [...] We can create, and in what place so e're [...] 260 [...] Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain [...] Through labour and endurance. This deep world [...] Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst [...] Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire [...] Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, [...] And with the Majesty of darkness round [...] Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar [...] Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? [...] As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light [...] Imitate when we please? This Desart soile [...] 270 [...] Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; [...] Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise [...] Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? [...] Our torments also may in length of time [...] Become our Elements, these piercing Fires [...] As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd [...] Into their temper; which must needs remove [...] The sensible of pain. All things invite [...] To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State [...] Of order, how in safety best we may [...] 280 [...] Compose our present evils, with regard [...] Of what we are and where, dismissing quite [...] All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise. [...] He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld [...] Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain [...] The sound of blustring winds, which all night long [...] Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull [...] Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance [...] Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay [...] After the Tempest: Such applause was heard [...] 290 [...] As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, [...] Advising peace: for such another Field [...] They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear [...] Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael [...] Wrought still within them; and no less desire [...] To found this nether Empire, which might rise [...] By pollicy, and long process of time, [...] In emulation opposite to Heav'n. [...] Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, [...] Satan except, none higher sat, with grave [...] 300 [...] Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd [...] A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven [...] Deliberation sat and publick care; [...] And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, [...] Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood [...] With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear [...] The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look [...] Drew audience and attention still as Night [...] Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. [...] Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n, [...] 310 [...] Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now [...] Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd [...] Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote [...] Inclines, here to continue, and build up here [...] A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, [...] And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd [...] This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat [...] Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt [...] From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League [...] Banded against his Throne, but to remaine [...] 320 [...] In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, [...] Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd [...] His captive multitude: For he, be sure, [...] In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign [...] Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part [...] By our revolt, but over Hell extend [...] His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule [...] Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. [...] What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? [...] Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss [...] 330 [...] Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none [...] Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n [...] To us enslav'd, but custody severe, [...] And stripes, and arbitrary punishment [...] Inflicted? and what peace can we return, [...] But to our power hostility and hate, [...] Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, [...] Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least [...] May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce [...] In doing what we most in suffering feel? [...] 340 [...] Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need [...] With dangerous expedition to invade [...] Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, [...] Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find [...] Some easier enterprize? There is a place [...] (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n [...] Err not) another World, the happy seat [...] Of som new Race call'd Man, about this time [...] To be created like to us, though less [...] In power and excellence, but favour'd more [...] 350 [...] Of him who rules above; so was his will [...] Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, [...] That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. [...] Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn [...] What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, [...] Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, [...] And where thir weakness, how attempted best, [...] By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, [...] And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure [...] In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd [...] 360 [...] The utmost border of his Kingdom, left [...] To their defence who hold it: here perhaps [...] Som advantagious act may be achiev'd [...] By sudden onset, either with Hell fire [...] To waste his whole Creation, or possess [...] All as our own, and drive as we were driven, [...] The punie habitants, or if not drive, [...] Seduce them to our Party, that thir God [...] May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand [...] Abolish his own works. This would surpass [...] 370 [...] Common revenge, and interrupt his joy [...] In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise [...] In his disturbance; when his darling Sons [...] Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse [...] Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, [...] Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth [...] Attempting, or to sit in darkness here [...] Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub [...] Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd [...] By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, [...] 380 [...] But from the Author of all ill could Spring [...] So deep a malice, to confound the race [...] Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell [...] To mingle and involve, done all to spite [...] The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves [...] His glory to augment. The bold design [...] Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy [...] Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent [...] They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. [...] Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, [...] 390 [...] Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, [...] Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep [...] Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, [...] Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view [...] Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms [...] And opportune excursion we may chance [...] Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone [...] Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light [...] Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam [...] Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, [...] 400 [...] To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires [...] Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send [...] In search of this new world, whom shall we find [...] Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet [...] The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss [...] And through the palpable obscure find out [...] His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight [...] Upborn with indefatigable wings [...] Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive [...] The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then [...] 410 [...] Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe [...] Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick [...] Of Angels watching round? Here he had need [...] All circumspection, and we now no less [...] Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, [...] The weight of all and our last hope relies. [...] This said, he sat; and expectation held [...] His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd [...] To second, or oppose, or undertake [...] The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, [...] 420 [...] Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each [...] In others count'nance red his own dismay [...] Astonisht: none among the choice and prime [...] Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found [...] So hardie as to proffer or accept [...] Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last [...] Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd [...] Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride [...] Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. [...] O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, [...] 430 [...] With reason hath deep silence and demurr [...] Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way [...] And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; [...] Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, [...] Outrageous to devour, immures us round [...] Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant [...] Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. [...] These past, if any pass, the void profound [...] Of unessential Night receives him next [...] Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being [...] 440 [...] Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. [...] If thence he scape into what ever world, [...] Or unknown Region, what remains him less [...] Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. [...] But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, [...] And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd [...] With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd [...] And judg'd of public moment, in the shape [...] Of difficulty or danger could deterre [...] Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume [...] 450 [...] These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, [...] Refusing to accept as great a share [...] Of hazard as of honour, due alike [...] To him who Reigns, and so much to him due [...] Of hazard more, as he above the rest [...] High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers, [...] Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, [...] While here shall be our home, what best may ease [...] The present misery, and render Hell [...] More tollerable; if there be cure or charm [...] 460 [...] To respite or deceive, or slack the pain [...] Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch [...] Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad [...] Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek [...] Deliverance for us all: this enterprize [...] None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose [...] The Monarch, and prevented all reply, [...] Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd [...] Others among the chief might offer now [...] (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; [...] 470 [...] And so refus'd might in opinion stand [...] His rivals, winning cheap the high repute [...] Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they [...] Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice [...] Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; [...] Thir rising all at once was as the sound [...] Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend [...] With awful reverence prone; and as a God [...] Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: [...] Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, [...] 480 [...] That for the general safety he despis'd [...] His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd [...] Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast [...] Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, [...] Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. [...] Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark [...] Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: [...] As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds [...] Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread [...] Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element [...] 490 [...] Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; [...] If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet [...] Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, [...] The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds [...] Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. [...] O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd [...] Firm concord holds, men onely disagree [...] Of Creatures rational, though under hope [...] Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, [...] Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife [...] 500 [...] Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, [...] Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: [...] As if (which might induce us to accord) [...] Man had not hellish foes anow besides, [...] That {{day and night for}} his destruction waite. [...] The Stygian Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth [...] In order came the grand infernal Peers, [...] Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd [...] Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less [...] Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, [...] 510 [...] And God-like imitated State; him round [...] A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd [...] With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. [...] Then of thir Session ended they bid cry [...] With Trumpets regal sound the great result: [...] Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim [...] Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie [...] By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss [...] Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell [...] With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. [...] 520 [...] Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd [...] By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers [...] Disband, and wandring, each his several way [...] Pursues, as inclination or sad choice [...] Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find [...] Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain [...] The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. [...] Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime [...] Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, [...] As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; [...] 530 [...] Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal [...] With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. [...] As when to warn proud Cities warr appears [...] Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush [...] To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van [...] Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears [...] Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms [...] From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. [...] Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell [...] Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [...] 540 [...] In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. [...] As when Alcides from Oealia Crown'd [...] With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore [...] Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, [...] And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [...] Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, [...] Retreated in a silent valley, sing [...] With notes Angelical to many a Harp [...] Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall [...] By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [...] 550 [...] Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. [...] Thir song was partial, but the harmony [...] (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) [...] Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment [...] The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [...] (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) [...] Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, [...] In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high [...] Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, [...] Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, [...] 560 [...] And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. [...] Of good and evil much they argu'd then, [...] Of happiness and final misery, [...] Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, [...] Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [...] Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm [...] Pain for a while or anguish, and excite [...] Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest [...] With stubborn patience as with triple steel. [...] Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, [...] 570 [...] On bold adventure to discover wide [...] That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps [...] Might yeild them easier habitation, bend [...] Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks [...] Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge [...] Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; [...] Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, [...] Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; [...] Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud [...] Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton [...] 580 [...] Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. [...] Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, [...] Lethe the River of Oblivion roules [...] Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, [...] Forthwith his former state and being forgets, [...] Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. [...] Beyond this flood a frozen Continent [...] Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms [...] Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land [...] Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [...] 590 [...] Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, [...] A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog [...] Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, [...] Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air [...] Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. [...] Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, [...] At certain revolutions all the damn'd [...] Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change [...] Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, [...] From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [...] 600 [...] Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine [...] Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, [...] Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. [...] They ferry over this Lethean Sound [...] Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, [...] And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach [...] The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose [...] In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, [...] All in one moment, and so neer the brink; [...] But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt [...] 610 [...] Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards [...] The Ford, and of it self the water flies [...] All taste of living wight, as once it fled [...] The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on [...] In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands [...] With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast [...] View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found [...] No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile [...] They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, [...] O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, [...] 620 [...] Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, [...] A Universe of death, which God by curse [...] Created evil, for evil only good, [...] Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, [...] Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, [...] Abominable, inutterable, and worse [...] Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, [...] Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. [...] Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, [...] Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, [...] 630 [...] Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell [...] Explores his solitary flight; som times [...] He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, [...] Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares [...] Up to the fiery concave touring high. [...] As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd [...] Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds [...] Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles [...] Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring [...] Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood [...] 640 [...] Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape [...] Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd [...] Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer [...] Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, [...] And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass [...] Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, [...] Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire, [...] Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat [...] On either side a formidable shape; [...] The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, [...] 650 [...] But ended foul in many a scaly <b>fould</b> [...] Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd [...] With mortal sting: about her middle round [...] A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd [...] With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung [...] A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, [...] If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, [...] And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd [...] Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these [...] Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts [...] 660 [...] Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: [...] Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd [...] In secret, riding through the Air she comes [...] Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance [...] With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon [...] Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, [...] If shape it might be call'd that shape had none [...] Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, [...] Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, [...] For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, [...] 670 [...] Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, [...] And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head [...] The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. [...] Satan was now at hand, and from his seat [...] The Monster moving onward came as fast, [...] With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. [...] Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, [...] Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, [...] Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd; [...] And with disdainful look thus first began. [...] 680 [...] Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, [...] That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance [...] Thy miscreated Front athwart my way [...] To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, [...] That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: [...] Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, [...] Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. [...] To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, [...] Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, [...] Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then [...] 690 [...] Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons [...] Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou [...] And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd [...] To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? [...] And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, [...] Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, [...] Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, [...] Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, [...] False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, [...] 700 [...] Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue [...] Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart [...] Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. [...] So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, [...] So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold [...] More dreadful and deform: on th' other side [...] Incenc't with indignation Satan stood [...] Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, [...] That fires the length of Ophiucus huge [...] In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair [...] 710 [...] Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head [...] Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands [...] No second stroke intend, and such a frown [...] Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds [...] With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on [...] Over the Caspian, then stand front to front [...] Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow [...] To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: [...] So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell [...] Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; [...] 720 [...] For never but once more was either like [...] To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds [...] Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, [...] Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat [...] Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, [...] Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. [...] O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, [...] Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, [...] Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart [...] Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; [...] 730 [...] For him who sits above and laughs the while [...] At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute [...] What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, [...] His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. [...] She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest [...] Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: [...] So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange [...] Thou interposest, that my sudden hand [...] Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds [...] What it intends; till first I know of thee, [...] 740 [...] What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why [...] In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st [...] Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son? [...] I know thee not, nor ever saw till now [...] Sight more detestable then him and thee. [...] T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; [...] Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem [...] Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair [...] In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight [...] Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd [...] 750 [...] In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, [...] All on a sudden miserable pain [...] Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm [...] In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast [...] Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, [...] Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, [...] Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd [...] Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd [...] All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid [...] At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign [...] 760 [...] Portentous held me; but familiar grown, [...] I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won [...] The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft [...] Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing [...] Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st [...] With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd [...] A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, [...] And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind [...] (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe [...] Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout [...] 770 [...] Through all the Empyrean: down they fell [...] Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down [...] Into this Deep, and in the general fall [...] I also; at which time this powerful Key [...] Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep [...] These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass [...] Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat [...] Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb [...] Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown [...] Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. [...] 780 [...] At last this odious offspring whom thou seest [...] Thine own begotten, breaking violent way [...] Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain [...] Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew [...] Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie [...] Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart [...] Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; [...] Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd [...] From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. [...] I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, [...] 790 [...] Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, [...] Me overtook his mother all dismaid, [...] And in embraces forcible and foule [...] Ingendring with me, of that rape begot [...] These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry [...] Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd [...] And hourly born, with sorrow infinite [...] To me, for when they list into the womb [...] That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw [...] My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth [...] 800 [...] Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, [...] That rest or intermission none I find. [...] Before mine eyes in opposition sits [...] Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, [...] And me his Parent would full soon devour [...] For want of other prey, but that he knows [...] His end with mine involvd; and knows that I [...] Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, [...] When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. [...] But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun [...] 810 [...] His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope [...] To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, [...] Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, [...] Save he who reigns above, none can resist. [...] She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore [...] Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. [...] Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, [...] And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge [...] Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys [...] Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change [...] 820 [...] Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know [...] I come no enemie, but to set free [...] From out this dark and dismal house of pain, [...] Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host [...] Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd [...] Fell with us from on high: from them I go [...] This uncouth errand sole, and one for all [...] My self expose, with lonely steps to tread [...] Th' unfounded deep, & through the void immense [...] To search with wandring quest a place foretold [...] 830 [...] Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now [...] Created vast and round, a place of bliss [...] In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't [...] A race of upstart Creatures, to supply [...] Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, [...] Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude [...] Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught [...] Then this more secret now design'd, I haste [...] To know, and this once known, shall soon return, [...] And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death [...] 840 [...] Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen [...] Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd [...] With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd [...] Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. [...] He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death [...] Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear [...] His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe [...] Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd [...] His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. [...] The key of this infernal Pit by due, [...] 850 [...] And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King [...] I keep, by him forbidden to unlock [...] These Adamantine Gates; against all force [...] Death ready stands to interpose his dart, [...] Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might. [...] But what ow I to his commands above [...] Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down [...] Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, [...] To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, [...] Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, [...] 860 [...] Here in perpetual agonie and pain, [...] With terrors and with clamors compasst round [...] Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: [...] Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou [...] My being gav'st me; whom should I obey [...] But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon [...] To that new world of light and bliss, among [...] The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign [...] At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems [...] Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. [...] 870 [...] Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, [...] Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; [...] And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, [...] Forthwith the huge Portcullis high up drew, [...] Which but her self not all the Stygian powers [...] Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns [...] Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar [...] Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease [...] Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie [...] With impetuous recoile and jarring sound [...] 880 [...] Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great [...] Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook [...] Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut [...] Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, [...] That with extended wings a Bannerd Host [...] Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through [...] With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; [...] So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth [...] Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. [...] Before thir eyes in sudden view appear [...] 890 [...] The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark [...] Illimitable Ocean without bound, [...] Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, [...] And time and place are lost; where eldest Night [...] And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold [...] Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise [...] Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. [...] For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce [...] Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring [...] Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag [...] 900 [...] Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, [...] Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, [...] Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands [...] Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, [...] Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise [...] Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, [...] Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, [...] And by decision more imbroiles the fray [...] By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter [...] Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, [...] 910 [...] The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, [...] Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, [...] But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt [...] Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, [...] Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain [...] His dark materials to create more Worlds, [...] Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend [...] Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, [...] Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith [...] He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd [...] 920 [...] With noises loud and ruinous (to compare [...] Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, [...] With all her battering Engines bent to rase [...] Som Capital City, or less then if this frame [...] Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements [...] In mutinie had from her Axle torn [...] The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes [...] He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak [...] Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League [...] As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides [...] 930 [...] Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets [...] A vast vacuitie: all unawares [...] Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops [...] Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour [...] Down had been falling, had not by ill chance [...] The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud [...] Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him [...] As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, [...] Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, [...] Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, [...] 940 [...] Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, [...] Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. [...] As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness [...] With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, [...] Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth [...] Had from his wakeful custody purloind [...] The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend [...] Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, [...] With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, [...] And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: [...] 950 [...] At length a universal hubbub wilde [...] Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd [...] Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare [...] With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, [...] Undaunted to meet there what ever power [...] Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss [...] Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask [...] Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes [...] Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne [...] Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread [...] 960 [...] Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd [...] Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, [...] The consort of his Reign; and by them stood [...] Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name [...] Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, [...] And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, [...] And Discord with a thousand various mouths. [...] T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers [...] And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, [...] Chaos and Ancient Night, I come no Spie, [...] 970 [...] With purpose to explore or to disturb [...] The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint [...] Wandring this darksome desart, as my way [...] Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, [...] Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek [...] What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds [...] Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place [...] From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King [...] Possesses lately, thither to arrive [...] I travel this profound, direct my course; [...] 980 [...] Directed, no mean recompence it brings [...] To your behoof, if I that Region lost, [...] All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce [...] To her original darkness and your sway [...] (Which is my present journey) and once more [...] Erect the Standerd there of Ancient Night; [...] Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. [...] Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old [...] With faultring speech and visage incompos'd [...] Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, [...] 990 [...] That mighty leading Angel, who of late [...] Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. [...] I saw and heard, for such a numerous host [...] Fled not in silence through the frighted deep [...] With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, [...] Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates [...] Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands [...] Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here [...] Keep residence; if all I can will serve, [...] That little which is left so to defend [...] 1000 [...] Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles [...] Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell [...] Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; [...] Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World [...] Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain [...] To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: [...] If that way be your walk, you have not farr; [...] So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; [...] Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. [...] He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, [...] 1010 [...] But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, [...] With fresh alacritie and force renew'd [...] Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire [...] Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock [...] Of fighting Elements, on all sides round [...] Environ'd wins his way; harder beset [...] And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd [...] Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: [...] Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd [...] Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. [...] 1020 [...] So he with difficulty and labour hard [...] Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; [...] But hee once past, soon after when man fell, [...] Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain [...] Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, [...] Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way [...] Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf [...] Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length [...] From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe [...] Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse [...] 1030 [...] With easie intercourse pass to and fro [...] To tempt or punish mortals, except whom [...] God and good Angels guard by special grace. [...] But now at last the sacred influence [...] Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n [...] Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night [...] A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins [...] Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire [...] As from her outmost works a brok'n foe [...] With tumult less and with less hostile din, [...] 1040 [...] That Satan with less toil, and now with ease [...] Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light [...] And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds [...] Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; [...] Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, [...] Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold [...] Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide [...] In circuit, undetermind square or round, [...] With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd [...] Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; [...] 1050 [...] And fast by hanging in a golden Chain [...] This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr [...] Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. [...] Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, [...] Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.|$|E
