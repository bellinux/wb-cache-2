This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem {{that it is hard to}} create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the things that happened, and what actually happened." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Because we can't prosecute {{somebody}} <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> {{not justify}} violating the law," [...] Banas said. [...] "We {{live in this}} country by {{the rule of the}} law." [...] He described Lori Drew as [...] "upset, cautious and guarded" [...] when he interviewed her. Banas said that Mrs. Drew felt [...] "terrible" [...] about Meier's death. A vigil was held for Megan Meier on November 24, 2007. The crowd gathered in a nearby parking lot and walked past the homes of the Meiers and the Drews. A small piece of ground adjacent to the Drews' house was the scene of remembrances by friends of the Meiers.|$|E

60|$|And now Stephen {{was going}} to try his luck again. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> seem funny.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> amuse him, for he {{lay back}} on the hay and laughed so heartily that his merriment scared the {{squirrel}} {{on the wall and}} woke Dulce.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for the claim of Portuguese priority is the 16th century Dieppe maps, {{some of which are}} said to show the west coast of Australia, including an island at the position of the Houtman Abrolhos. This island is unlabelled on most of the Dieppe maps, but on Pierre Desceliers' 1550 map, it is labelled Arenes. In 1895, George Collingridge suggested that Arenes was a corruption of Abrolhos, but this was mocked by Heeres in 1898, and according to J. S. Battye [...] "this suggestion can scarcely be regarded seriously. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not in any way add to the merit of the Portuguese claim".|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of dual rule had become established among the Lithuanian dukes, {{enabling them to}} contain the Teutonic Knights in the west while pursuing expansionism in the east. There had been previous joint reigns between Dausprungas and Mindaugas, Pukuveras and Butigeidis, Vytenis and Gediminas, Jaunutis and Kęstutis, {{as well as between}} Algirdas and Kęstutis. The nature of this Lithuanian dual rule, as also practised between Jogaila and Kęstutis and later between Jogaila and Vytautas, is difficult to define precisely. According to the historian S.C.Rowell, it [...] "reflects political expediency; <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not meet the formal definition of diarchy as 'rule by two independent authorities'...those two leaders were not equal: the grand duke in Vilnius was supreme".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate, we {{must all}} say this: she hasn't lost any time. I don't know what Sir Henry may think of it; but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> seem to me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've heard that, too, eh?" [...] he muttered. [...] "It {{occurred}} {{to me from the}} first, Chetwode. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> occur to me. You will remember that I mentioned it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The Flint Hill-Potomac rivalry was {{relatively}} {{new in the}} early-to-mid 1990s, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not lack the intensity, passion, and excitement that it still has to this day,” - Jim Fitzpatrick ...|$|R
60|$|She got up, {{and taking}} his hand, muttered something; <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not matter what, {{for it was}} inaudible; but such as the words were, {{they were the first}} spoken between them.|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. If by {{the future}} {{you mean the}} millennial {{delusions}} which you use as a bunch of carrots to lure the uneducated British donkey to the polling booth to vote for you, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{conscience}} {{is quite}} bewildered with its responsibilities,' she continued, with a sigh. 'Yet <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> sometimes {{say to me}} that--that I ought to keep my word. Very well; I must go on as I am going, I suppose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope it's {{not as bad}} as all that, Dick," [...] Jack laughed. [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> seem as if we were {{purposely}} {{giving the}} Russians time to strengthen themselves. But you'll see when we go at them we shall make short work of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> and had Godfrey Palliser been {{a little}} less punctilious he might have betrayed it. As it was, {{he said in a}} {{perfectly}} level voice, “May I ask you for what purpose?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} quite impossible," [...] the lawyer answered. [...] "Mine was, of course, a privileged inspection, and I am going beyond my duty in {{mentioning}} this affair to you. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> seem very singular." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May “The True Cost” premieres in London, Milan, Paris, New York and Los Angeles. At a Cannes Film Festival reception, Harvey Weinstein proclaims that ‘this movie’s {{going to}} shock the fashion world’, and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not, by any means: but, however {{modified}} or limited, this immortality is {{the first}} thing we ought to take note of in the mosses. They are, in some degree, what the [...] "everlasting" [...] is in flowers. Those minute green leaves of theirs do not decay, nor fall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose I must {{be content}} with that, Hilda. But <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> seem {{extraordinary}} to me that by merely seeing two men in a box {{on the other side}} of the house you should have obtained a clew to what you have for a year now been trying to get at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} look {{as if we were}} popular, Mr. Ferguson," [...] the captain said to the first lieutenant. [...] "It may be that they object to our {{presence}} altogether, or it may be because they believe {{that we are going to}} the assistance of this Rajah Sehi. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not look well for the future." ...|$|E
60|$|Prickly Porky scowled, and a {{few more}} little spears peeped out of his long coat. You know no one likes to be laughed at, and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> look as if old Mr. Toad was {{laughing}} at him.|$|R
50|$|Patricia {{has also}} been named one of Models.com top 50 models. She was quoted saying, 'I’m {{extremely}} honored {{to be one of}} the top 50 models on models.com. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not harm my career in anyway!' in an interview with Pony Ryder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I dare say," [...] said Silverbridge, {{turning away}} into the path where he saw Miss Boncassen {{standing}} with some other ladies. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not occur to him that Popplecourt was to be brought forward as a suitor for his sister's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{will not}} say {{there is nothing in}} the work {{indicative}} of talent. The hero's valet, Jacob Brush, and the heroine's lady's-maid, Jacintha Pintail, are both humorous and good in their way. Why it should be so, we do not pretend to say; but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> appear to us that Mr. Tudor is more at home in the servants' hall than in the lady's boudoir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, do you know," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Vervain, [...] "I {{thought it}} was Chinese! Their things are, so odd. But really, in an Armenian convent it's very misleading. I don't {{think you ought to}} leave it there; <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> throw people off the track," [...] she added, subduing the expression to something very lady-like, by the winning appeal with which she used it.|$|E
6000|$|My Father started--"What {{noise is}} that," [...] (said he.) [...] "It {{sounds like a}} loud rapping at the door"--(replied my Mother.) [...] "it does indeed." [...] (cried I.) [...] "I am of your opinion; (said my Father) <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> appear to proceed from some {{uncommon}} violence exerted against our unoffending door." [...] "Yes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who knocks for admittance." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{heavy as}} the {{undertaking}} must have been, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not engross all {{the activities of}} Shelley's wife in this period. And it seems highly probable that the two little mythological dramas which we here publish belong to this same year 1820.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{look like}} a blizzard, with the snow coming down thickly and the wind blowing it first in one {{direction}} then in another. By nightfall the streets were almost impassable, {{and in the morning}} traffic along Riverside Drive was practically suspended.|$|R
60|$|The {{stoppage}} of this bank, {{with all}} its ruinous consequences, had cast (as I was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under the depressing effect of which it yet laboured. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> seem rather dull and out of spirits.|$|R
6000|$|In {{precisely}} the same way, Major Ellis proves the degeneration of deity in Africa, so far as being localised in place of being the Universal God, implies degeneration, as <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> to our minds. By being attached to a given hill or river 'the gods, instead of being regarded as being interested {{in the whole of}} mankind, would eventually come to be regarded as being interested in separate tribes or nations alone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} it was a new suit or not, but it was mighty good looking," [...] replied Peter. [...] "I just love that {{beautiful}} reddish-brown of his back, wings and tail, and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> set off his white and buff waistcoat with those dark streaks and spots. You must admit, Jenny Wren, that any one seeing him dressed so much like the Thrushes is to be excused for thinking him a Thrush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... sings of Italy, of the people, of progress, {{with the}} rhetoricalities {{of the modern}} Arcadians; {{and he has a}} poem called [...] "The Ball", which must fairly, as <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> wittily, {{represent}} one of those anomalous entertainments which rich foreigners give in Italy, and to which all sorts of irregular aliens resort, something of the local aristocracy appearing also in a ghostly and bewildered way. Yet even in this poem there is a political lesson.|$|E
6000|$|... [1] The {{word in the}} {{original}} is exterminatis, but of [...] course exterminare then bore its etymological sense of [...] expatriation or expulsion, if not merely of confiscation, [...] while <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not imply the idea of slaughter, [...] connoted by the modern word.|$|R
60|$|And so <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> {{and smiled}} into the bargain, while the boys came clamouring up, and after thanks for Don's preservation, began loudly to beg mamma would come, {{they could not}} make up their sides without her, but mamma was distressed and unhappy.|$|R
60|$|When {{they went}} down to the dining-room of the hotel at which they were {{stopping}} <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> look like rain. Yet there was a brisk breeze blowing, and several expressed themselves as certain that it would pass around to the north of them.|$|R
