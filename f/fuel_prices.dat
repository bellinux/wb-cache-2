5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were too expensive to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
40|$|Increasing price levels, {{high price}} {{volatility}} and the suspicion of collusive behavior are important topics of public debates on competition in retail gasoline markets in many countries.

5|$|GoAir {{was founded}} in 2005 by Jehangir Wadia, son of Indian {{industrialist}} Nusli Wadia. The airline is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wadia Group. GoAir commenced its operations using an Airbus A320 aircraft and operated its inaugural flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 4 November 2005. The airline initially operated with a single aircraft to four destinations including Goa and Coimbatore with plans to induct 36 aircraft by 2008. In March 2008, the airline announced revised plans to operate 11 aircraft and service new destinations in North East and South India {{by the end of}} the year.

5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> {{sensitivity of}} French traffic. Crucially, it develops {{the use of}} innovative econometric models. Partial adjustment models have been selected to represent traffic between 1990 and 2010. The road traffic model includes explanatory variables such as the <b>fuel</b> <b>price,</b> GDP, {{the length of the}} motorway network, and a lagged variable of traffic. Furthermore, a rail demand model including <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> as an explanatory variable is also processed. In the short term, an increase of 10 % in <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> leads to a fall of 1, 4 % in the road traffic whereas in the long term, it leads to a fall of 2, 8 %...|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} meltdown {{was accompanied by}} increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. Golkar won the rigged 1997 MPR elections and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs). The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. The Government increased the <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> further by 70% on May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in Medan.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E

5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as <b>fuel</b> <b>prices.</b> The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
25|$|Locally {{decreasing}} fuel tax can decrease <b>fuel</b> <b>prices,</b> but globally {{prices are}} set by supply and demand, and therefore fuel tax decreases {{may have no}} effect on <b>fuel</b> <b>prices,</b> and fuel tax increases might actually decrease <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> by reducing demand. But this depends on the price elasticity of demand for fuel which is -0.09 to -0.31, meaning that fuel is a relatively inelastic commodity, i.e. increasing or decreasing prices have overall only a small effect on demand and therefor price change.|$|E
