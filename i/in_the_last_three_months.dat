5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors {{did not have to}} reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis {{before the start of the}} 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E

Overy maintains that the German estimates are based on incorrect speculations for losses during the last three months of the war when there was a gap in the record keeping system. He points out that the figures for air raid dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of the war were estimated in the West German figures from 1956 at 300,000 people which he believes is not plausible. The official figures include an inflated total of 60,000 in the Bombing of Dresden and the inclusion of refugees fleeing westward.|$|E

He also covered the [...] "Jewish question", with particular consideration to the anti-partisan movement. Following the conference, a 16-page executive summary was distributed to the Wehrmacht troops and police units in the rear area.

500|$|Ambrose's {{shoulder}} injury, {{caused by}} his bowling workload, {{caused him to}} miss the West Indies' tour of India <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 1994. Although he returned to join the tour of New Zealand in early 1995, he did not reach his full bowling pace; he took one wicket in the ODI series and five in the two Test matches. He remained in the team when Australia toured the Caribbean later in 1995; the West Indies lost the Test series 2–1, their first defeat in a Test series since 1980. After taking two wickets in four ODIs, Ambrose took 13 wickets at 19.84 in the four-Test series to lead the West Indian averages. He took nine of these wickets in Trinidad during the third Test, when West Indies levelled the series having lost the first Test (the second was drawn). Bowling on a pitch that was extremely difficult for batting, and which both teams considered to be unsatisfactory, Ambrose took nine for 65 in the match and was named man of the match. During the game, Ambrose had to be pulled away from a verbal confrontation with Steve Waugh by the captain, Richardson. But outside of this match, the Australian team judged his bowling to have declined in pace following his shoulder injury, and that he lacked the variety {{to adapt to a}} different role. The West Indies' cricket manager, former Test bowler Andy Roberts, publicly claimed during the series that several of his team possessed [...] "attitude problems", and complained that the fast bowlers would not follow his advice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{division}} {{was formed in}} June 1941 and spent three months at the front and six months on rear-security duties in the Gomel area. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting guerillas (partisans) in the Werhmacht's rear areas. In September 1941, the officers of the division attended the Mogilev conference, organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of the rear area (...) behind Army Group Centre. The conference, while ostensibly an [...] "anti-partisan training", resulted in {{a dramatic increase in}} atrocities against Jews and other civilians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 1941. The division reported shooting 1,847 [...] "partisans" [...] in two months alone. Hostage-taking also increased dramatically.

2500|$|A {{study in}} the UK {{conducted}} from 2011 to 2012 found that false claims of rape and domestic violence are uncommon.

However, the study showed {{there were only a}} few false allegations during seventeen months over 2011-2012. The study revealed that during the seventeen months, there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales, and in the same timespan, there were thirty-five prosecutions for making false allegations of rape, six prosecutions for false allegations of domestic violence, and three for false allegations of both crimes. Following the study and the eleven percent increase of reported cases of domestic violence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of 2012, there have been enhancements in the handling of the reported crimes with random checks of cases to ensure the correct handling of the prosecution of the cases.|$|E
