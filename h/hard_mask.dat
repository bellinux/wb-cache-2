In this work a recipe for establishing a two layer <b>hard</b> <b>mask</b> suitable for ion beam etching (IBE) has been developed. A chromium <b>hard</b> <b>mask</b> is patterned and deposited using electron beam lithography (EBL) and lift off. The pattern is transferred to an underlying carbon layer by oxygen reactive ion etching (RIE).
