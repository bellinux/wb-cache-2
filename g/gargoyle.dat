5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him. Gordon developed the idea into an X-File involving possession by a <b>gargoyle</b> spirit. He wrote a draft script for the episode but had to turn to series creator Chris Carter three days before production began in order to rework it. The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be very proud of the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the <b>gargoyle</b> sketches used in this episode.|$|E

5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated {{to the site of}} a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake <b>gargoyle</b> to the building.|$|E

Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence; though they have limited strength before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit <b>gargoyle</b> heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux <b>gargoyle</b> to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a <b>gargoyle,</b> a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format.

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of <b>gargoyles</b> located across the walls of the Quadrangle and its towers. Some serve the {{functional}} purpose of waterspouts and draining water from buildings, but many are simply decorative <b>gargoyles,</b> also known as 'grotesque'. The abundance of a variety of <b>gargoyles</b> featured in the Quadrangle’s architecture relates to <b>gargoyles</b> being characteristic of Neo-Gothic medieval architecture, as they have a symbolic role of warding off evil spirits in the Catholic tradition. Traditionally, <b>gargoyles</b> often depicted fantastical and mythical creatures, but in the turn of the 12th century stonemasons started incorporating real animals; both kinds of creatures {{can be found on the}} Quadrangle. Such medieval influenced architecture, although partially appropriated to a local context, directly mimic designs of esteemed Cambridge and Oxford universities in England.|$|R
50|$|Greg has {{mentioned}} {{that while the}} episode itself is canon in the <b>Gargoyles</b> universe, the entire series Team Atlantis is not. In fact, the Team Atlantis interpretations of The Loch Ness Monster and Puck differ from those seen in <b>Gargoyles</b> (notably, the Loch Ness Monster in <b>Gargoyles</b> actually is a surviving Plesiosaur belonging to a colony, like the common depiction).|$|R

Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (<b>gargoyle</b> faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a <b>gargoyle.</b> The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E

5000|$|Grotesques {{are often}} {{confused}} with <b>gargoyles,</b> but {{the distinction is}} that <b>gargoyles</b> are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not.
