5000|$|By the mid-1950s, overextraction {{of timber}} {{had begun to}} reduce the {{economic}} value of <b>gyppo</b> logging. [...] By the 1970s environmental regulation and other economic changes in the logging industry had driven many <b>gyppo</b> loggers out of business. By the early 21st century <b>gyppo</b> loggers had been described as [...] "an endangered species." ...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>gyppo</b> logger (sometimes spelled [...] "gypo logger") is a {{lumberjack}} {{who runs}} or {{works for a}} small scale logging operation that is independent from an established sawmill or lumber company. The <b>gyppo</b> system {{is one of two}} main patterns of the organization of logging labor in the Pacific Northwest, the other being the [...] "company logger." [...] <b>Gyppo</b> loggers were originally condemned by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as strikebreakers.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "gyppo logger" [...] {{is opposed}} to the [...] "company logger," [...] who is {{employed}} by a lumber company or lumber mill at an hourly or daily wage and generally belongs to a union. <b>Gyppos,</b> on the other hand, work for themselves, run economically marginal operations, [...] and employ a small crew on a fixed-price basis, although they occasionally work for mills on a flat rate, contract, or piecework basis.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a Great Notion is Ken Kesey's second novel, {{published}} in 1964. While One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1962) is arguably more famous, many critics consider Sometimes a Great Notion Kesey's magnum opus. The story involves an Oregon family of <b>gyppo</b> loggers who cut and procure trees {{for a local}} mill in opposition to striking, unionized workers.|$|E
50|$|According to William Robbins, {{writing on}} the postwar timber boom in the Coos Bay region of Oregon,The {{immediate}} postwar years in southwestern Oregon were {{the heyday of the}} storied <b>gyppo</b> logging and sawmill operator - the hardy individual who worked on marginal capital, usually through subcontracts with a major company or broker, and whose equipment was invariably pieced together with baling wire.|$|E
5000|$|Technological {{developments}} after World War II made <b>gyppo</b> logging {{even more}} economically rewarding, especially {{the invention of}} gasoline powered chainsaws which were light enough {{to be used by}} a single person and the use of diesel engines to power [...] "donkeys" [...] that had previously been powered by steam. [...] These later gyppos also took advantage of the increased affordability of light industrial equipment, such as trucks and Caterpillar tractors and typically employed family labor in order to keep their operations economically viable.|$|E
5000|$|The IWW {{introduced}} the term [...] "gyppo" [...] during the unsuccessful 1917-8 Pacific Northwest strike for the Eight-hour day for loggers, although undoubtedly <b>gyppo</b> loggers existed before 1917. Because the strike was unsuccessful, after the loggers {{returned to work}} they called a slowdown. This tactic was so effective that in response the company owners instituted piecework or flat-rate pay scales. The pine timber in the Pacific Northwest is comparatively small {{and a lot of}} it is on government land (disallowing the use of railways to transport logs). Thus the conditions facilitate logging with small crews and portable machinery.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "gyppo" [...] was {{commonly}} prepended to form nicknames among loggers, e.g. [...] "Gyppo Jake." [...] The {{word was}} introduced by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to disparage strikebreakers and other loggers who thwarted their organizing efforts. [...] The IWW currently uses the term to refer to [...] "Any piece-work system; a job where the worker is paid by the volume they produce, rather than by their time." [...] Mittelman quotes an editorial from the Industrial Worker on the subject:At present the master class of capitalists call it 'contract labor,' 'piece work,' and other fancy names...For us, the proletarians, it is 'gyppoing' and it means all that the name connotes. The <b>gyppo</b> {{is a man who}} 'gyps' his fellow workers and finally himself, out of the fruits of all our organized victories in the class war." ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Social Science, 1996 Discusses {{the rise}} and decline of the <b>gyppo</b> (small contract) logging and sawmill {{industry}} in Humboldt County, California between 1945 and 1965. Historical discussion {{of the role of}} large redwood companies, and transportation systems which they used, prior to 1945. Explains the land ownership patterns, resource diffusion of the primary resource (Douglas-fir), and emerging logging technology. This allowed <b>gyppo</b> contractors to rival the production of the established industry. Conclusion: too many mills harvested excessive amounts of old-growth Douglas-fir during the 1950 's. Tightening log supply situation during the 1960 's and 1970 's drove most <b>gyppo</b> mills out of business, and reduced the employment potential of the forest products industry. <b>Gyppo</b> logging continues to be somewhat viable, working individual contracts for large, integrated forest products companies...|$|E
