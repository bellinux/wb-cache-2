Product reliability is considered as a prime contributor to quality and competitiveness. The reliability of the product is usually determined by testing the product to failure and collection of time to failure (TTF) data. For some products the test time to evaluate reliability is usually very longer, if it is tested under actual working condition of the products. Hence the accelerated and highly accelerated life testing (HALT) testing method is employed to accelerate to stress condition on the product to quicken the degradation of products performance.

SnS 2 is a two-dimensional (2 D) layered material which exhibits a promising electrical characteristics as a channel material for field-effect transistors (FETs) because of its high mobility, good on/off ratio and low temperature processability.

Weidmann Medical Technology ?s consistent leadership in the manufacture of microstructured devices has come from successfully adapting existing processes and expertise from other industries. Small academic labs and companies often develop a small number of working devices fabricated using PDMS or glass. However, for the commercialization of microfluidic <b>devices,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> must be scaled up and processes adapted to injection molding.

The effective passive methods for heat transfer augmentation are the additive technique for nanofluid and swirl flow devices, are acquiring great attention in order to enhance the thermal performance of the heat exchangers. Among the swirl flow devices which are used to create swirl or secondary flow, twisted-tape inserts are very popular because of their good thermal performance. The increasing demand for more efficient heat transfer fluids in many applications has been led to enhance heat transfer to meet the cooling challenge necessary. Nanofluid is a relatively new engineering material consisting of the nanometre-sized additives and base fluids, has gained extensive attention due to its role in improving the efficiency of thermal systems. Although, there are many studies of nanofluids with different types of base fluid such as water, Ethylene glycol (EG) and Propylene glycol (PG), there are very limited studies of using nanofluids with BioGlycol as a base fluid. While, BioGlycol (BG) showed more advantages compared to water Ethylene glycol (EG) and Propylene glycol (PG), for instance, a much lower freezing point and higher boiling point than water, provided lower viscosity compared to Propylene glycol (PG) and Ethylene glycol (EG), has greater thermal stability while possessing similar or better thermophysical properties compared to Propylene and Ethylene glycols and non-toxic renewable sourced fluid.

Laser beam joining techniques {{have been under}} intensive investigations and subsequently new processes for mass manufacturing and high accuracy assembling were established. With the newly developed SHADOW(R) welding technology technical aspects such as tensile strength, geometry and precision of the weld could be improved. This technology provides highest flexibility in weld geometry with a minimum welding {{time as well as}} new possibilities in using application adapted materials. Different parts and even different metals can be joined by a non-contact process. The application of a relative movement between the laser beam and the part to be joined at feed rates of up to 60 m/min produces weld seams with a length from 0. 6 mm to 15. 7 mm using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of up to 50 ms. Due to the low energy input, typically 1 J to 6 J, a weld width as small as 50 ?m and a weld depth as small as 20 pm have been attained. This results in low distortion of the joined watch components. Within this paper this new welding process will be explained and several examples of joined components will be presented with respect to fundamentals and the sustainable implementation of the SHADOW(R) welding technique into watch manufacturing and electronic industry.

40|$|In {{the media}} sector, {{recently}} new means of distribution, new platforms for accessing media and consequently new media products have been introduced. With new products potential environmental impacts related to activities of media companies are changing. Finnish media publisher Alma Media commissioned an LCA study {{in order to}} learn more about environmental impacts related to their mature and emerging products. Based on this, the current paper aims to present potential environmental impacts related to printed and online newspapers, focusing on their differences and challenges in assessing, comparing, communicating and acting on the results. Three newspapers are studied as cases, covering upstream printing house supply chain, printing house activities, delivery to readers and final disposal for print versions; electronic storage and distribution, the relevant share of <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and disposal and electricity needed for downloading and reading for online versions; content production for both. Mainly generic data was used for online products assessment, since specific data were not available. The specific data for the more mature print products were detailed but less comprehensive than generic. The implication is increased uncertainty and difficulties in communication of results. Environmental performance of both printed and online newspapers is dependent on various characteristics of the newspaper and its readers, including e. g. format and number of pages for print versions, and type of device used and its total use, size of content download and reading time for online versions. User practices may be changing as emerging products get more mature, which will influence environmental performance. Print and online versions give rise to different types of environmental impacts and the distribution of impacts in the life cycles differ. Printed newspaper impacts largely occur in the printing house supply chain and in delivery to readers, whereas online newspapers impacts are mainly connected to the <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> supply chain, and to some extent electricity used for reading and distribution. Impacts of printed newspapers studied occur more locally with paper manufacturing and printing located in Finland. Impacts related to online versions largely occur in other countries. Also, new value chain actors are involved, which are not directly related to the media company. Different actions for improvement may be necessary for emerging media products, as well as new types of collaborations. Comparison of online and print versions is not straightforward as different benefits are provided and reader practices differ. Although emerging media products may be considered substitutes for print counterparts, this is not necessarily the case. The choice of functional unit of assessment proved crucial for the comparison. Different functional units were used (one year, one reader and week, one reading hour). Comparing print and online versions Alma Media online newspapers showed lower environmental impacts than their print versions per year and also per reader and week. However, impacts per reading hour were lower for printed newspapers in some cases. Using different kinds of perspectives, e. g. through different functional units, gives more information and increased knowledge. Complexity in assessing, comparing, communicating and acting on emerging media products was experienced in this study. Further studies and action need to be taken. QC 20121221 </p...|$|R

40|$|Many small <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> such as PDAs {{and cell}} phones have changed our daily life over the past years. A next step will be the {{embedding}} of their functionality and circuits directly into textiles. In this paper we discuss for the first time, feasible methods and algorithms for establishing a routing structure in textiles while utilizing standard printed wiring board (PWB) tools. Our approaches focus on a woven textile with embedded copper wires, which guarantees usual wearing comfort, and circuits with few chips running at few megahertz. We present differences between regular PWBs and textiles regarding routing structure, space occupancy and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) along with possible <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R
