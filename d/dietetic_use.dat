40|$|Varying {{consumption}} {{trends and}} poor dietary habits {{had led to}} widespread prevalence of various lifestyles related disorders including obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia. The reliance of communities on processed foods is also detrimental factor in their progression. The concerted efforts are {{required in order to}} eliminate these problems. In this project, efforts were directed to prepare nutritious <b>dietetic</b> cookies <b>using</b> Black Cumin Fixed Oil (BCFO). Accordingly, formulations of cookies were modified to reduce the fats, sugar and energy level along with provision of some bioactive molecules from BCFO. The results indicated that reduction in fat and sugar levels provided less calorific value to cookies. However, utilization of BCFO (~ 4 %) resulted in some quality retention even at reduced levels of fats and sugars. Furthermore, reducing the level of shortening and sugars resulted in decreased fat contents (45. 61 %) as compared to control. Similarly, total sugar levels were decreased by 43. 17 %. These cumulative factors led to dwindled calorific value by 37. 98 %. The reduction in fats and sugars led to decreased sensory appraisal from trained taste panel. However, at 40 % reduction in fats and sugars were quite acceptable owing to presence of BCFO. It further provided protection against lipid per-oxidation as indicated from peroxide value. In the nutshell, preparation of nutritious and <b>dietetic</b> cookies <b>using</b> BCFO is feasible approach to reduce the calorific value of cookies and such novel products hold potential to reduce the obesity and related disorders...|$|R

Hospital in-patients are not homogeneous as for age, dietary needs and diseases, so it's necessary to treat them with an ad hoc nutritional intervention not established in advance in a dietetic manual; if from an organisation point of view it is necessary to have such a dietetic manual, it has to be based on nutritional guidelines and recommended dietary allowances...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{considerable}} interest in healthcare research regarding communication skills and some debate surrounding {{the effectiveness of}} a patient-centred approach to care. Understanding patient experiences of consultations can help indicate how consultations can be modified to improve effectiveness. At present, there is little research exploring patient experience of dietetic consultations. The aim of this project was to achieve a better understanding of patients??? experiences of <b>dietetic</b> consultations <b>using</b> qualitative analysis. Methods: Patients undergoing consultations with a dietitian were invited to discuss their experience of the consultation with a research dietitian not involved in their care. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted and analyzed using the Framework approach. Results: Seventeen patients participated and described experiences of consultations which were varied and influenced by factors such information given (resources, explanation, repetition, consistency), their dietitian???s approach (prescriptive or non-prescriptive, use of behaviours change skills) and behaviour (listening skills, body language) and appointment (expectations, involvement of the multidisciplinary team, length of time) as well as their own internal experience (confidence, guilt, frustration). Patients agreed that certain factors, such as good communication and rapport, receiving effective and reliable information and resources, and non-judgmental, regular support were important factors in creating a positive experience of their consultation. However, they differed in what they believed constituted these factors. Conclusions: Patients like dietitians to adopt a patient-centred approach, which might be either patient- or practitioner-led, and to take account of what they wanted from consultations, adapting these to meet their individual requirements...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{attempted}} {{to answer the}} following question: What instructional methods should <b>dietetic</b> preceptors <b>use</b> to help <b>dietetic</b> interns meet the performance requirements specified by the American Dietetic Association (ADA, 1991) for entry-level dietitians? A national sample of 170 dietetic preceptors was surveyed. Ninety provided usable information to examine both the instructional methods they used to train interns as well as those methods they might try to use. Thirty instructional methods were grouped into six categories: one-to-one methods, practice/experiential methods, reading-writing methods, lecture-discussion methods, exercises/problem sets and student-directed learning. This study recommends seven "best" methods and seven "best" techniques for preceptors to use when instructing interns. Two methods, supervised practice and unsupervised practice, seemed the most important to include in the training of potential preceptors. These methods are effective, practical, and address criticality pertaining to {{the health and safety of}} patients and clients. To a lesser extent cost efficiency in these methods is related to the use of the preceptor's time. Unsupervised practice is the least time-intensive for the preceptor, but requires supporting techniques, such as, feedback or conferencing, to address health and safety issues. Five less expensive methods with equal effectiveness for promoting learning for adults can supplement or support these more costly one-to-one and supervised practice methods. These methods are shadowing, case studies, simulations, student-directed seminars and role playing. In addition, self-instruction, student teams, team building exercises, in-basket exercises and learning contracts can be blended with other instructional methods for better preceptor instruction. Since only 40 percent of the 90 preceptors surveyed reported having any preceptor training, a proposal is made to train new and experienced preceptors in the most applicable methods and techniques they can use in instructing and precepting dietetic interns...|$|R

40|$|Haemodialysis {{patients}} may have low albumin levels {{due to a}} cascade of factors, including inflammation and reduced dietary intake. Albumin is commonly used in clinical settings by dieticians {{as part of a}} comprehensive nutritional assessment. Presently many <b>dietetic</b> practitioners <b>use</b> interchangeably pre-dialysis and post-dialysis biochemical measurements for albumin. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the difference between pre-dialysis and post-dialysis serum albumin measurement and its relationship to intra-dialytic weight gain. Fourty-six stable (21 Australian indigenous, 25 non-indigenous) haemodialysis patients were enrolled in a three month cross-sectional study. During the study patients underwent routine haemodialysis treatment and biochemical tests. Weight and biochemical measurements were collected pre and post dialysis on the first Tuesday or Wednesday of each month. A patient generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) was conducted in the third month of the study. The incidence of low albumin levels (< 35 g/L) was 56 % (n= 26) when serum albumin was measured pre-dialysis, this was reduced to 30 % (n= 14) when measured post-dialysis. Analysis of serum albumin found a 2. 6 g/L (CI 1. 7 - 3. 5) difference in concentration between pre and post dialysis measurements (p= 0. 000), with serum albumin less concentrated in pre-dialysis blood samples. Intra-dialytic weight gain (2. 0 kg, CI 1. 7 - 2. 3) correlated with the change in serum albumin (r= 0. 464, p= 0. 001). Intra-dialytic weight gain and the difference between pre and post dialysis serum albumin was greater in Australian indigenous patients than in non-indigenous patients. PG-SGA score was more strongly correlated with post-dialysis than pre-dialysis serum albumin (r= 0. 430, p= 0. 003; r= 0. 389, p= 0. 008 respectively). This study indicates that measurement of serum albumin should be undertaken post-dialysis when using the measurement as part of a nutritional assessment. Pre-dialysis serum albumin measurement may falsely indicate poor nutritional status, and should be followed with a post-dialysis measurement to confirm finding...|$|R

This {{study investigated the}} effects of an 8 -week weight-control program on serum adiponectin, TNF-alpha, and blood lipid level profiles in obese subjects. Twenty obese subjects with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kg/m(2) were recruited for this weight loss program that <b>used</b> <b>dietetic</b> control and aerobic exercise training. A total of 3 obese men and 11 obese women (mean age, 40. 3 +/- 10. 8 years; BMI, 30. 0 +/- 3. 4 kg/m(2)) finished the program. Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics in subjects {{before and after the}} program were determined. The results showed that subjects' body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly (P <. 05) decreased during the program. Further analysis showed a negative correlation between delta adiponectin and delta TNF-alpha, triacylglycerol, and systolic blood pressure in obese subjects. Subgroup analysis showed that obese subjects whose original BMI was less than 30 kg/m 2 had significantly increased serum adiponectin levels, and more than 3 % weight reduction markedly improved blood lipids and body fat profiles during the program. Our findings suggest that weight reduction through an 8 -week weight loss program may have anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects via increased serum adiponectin levels and improvements in blood lipid profiles and systolic blood pressure.

40|$|Dietetic {{practice}} {{is continuing to}} develop and evolve within a context of changing health paradigms. These paradigms are currently shifting, moving from a ‘medical illness’ paradigm to a ‘wellness and wellbeing’’ paradigm. In this newly evolving paradigm ‘holistic’ outcomes are valued and lifestyle behaviours such as healthy food choice are recognised {{to play an important}} role in achieving optimal health. These shifts are also reflected in changes in other areas of society such as the access and ownership of health care. This ownership is moving from being predominantly managed by health professionals to more proactive management by the individuals themselves. The changes in health care ownership recognise the individuals’ rights to information as well as their pivotal role in the health decision-making process. In keeping with this change, the Dietetic discipline globally recognises the person or patient-centred model as being fundamental to effective practice. (American Dietetic Association (ADA) 2002 a; World Health Organisation(WHO) 2005) (American Dietetic Association (ADA) 2002 a; World Health Organisation(WHO) 2005) (American Dietetic Association (ADA) 2002 a; World Health Organisation(WHO) 2005) However it is not clear how the change in the health paradigm is being understood by the Dietetic practitioner, or by those with whom they work, with respect to food choice behaviour. Examination of discourse and language is a methodology that help reveal the possible meanings attributed to changing phenomena and how those meanings are being interpreted by individuals and groups within society. In particular, the keywords ‘wellness and wellbeing’ appear to have significant agency within this newly evolving holistic health paradigm and are found embedded in a number of discourses such as social and professional practice about food. Thus these terms are worthy of examination from within a dietetic context to ascertain how they might be interpreted by individuals in relation to food choice behaviour. In this thesis women were considered the dominant gender in the procurement and serving of food and so were targeted for study on the ‘how and why’ individuals might consider changing their behaviours in areas relevant to Dietetic practice. Hence the aims of this thesis were to: 1. Describe the meaning of ‘wellness’ and ‘well-being’ attributed by stakeholders and women commonly involved in nutrition interventions; 2. Identify the relevant dimensions of those terms that might contribute to food choice decisions; and 3. Evaluate those dimensions identified in a particular dietetic context of a dietary weight loss trial. To address these aims a collective of five case studies with women participants was undertaken using qualitative methodologies. These series of case studies were combinative to build textual data around the dynamic influences impacting food choice in the current wellness and wellbeing paradigm. This studies included a combination of 15 focus groups (n= 80), and in-depth interviews (n = 183) which were conducted using semi-structured guides. A synopsis of the case studies follows: - the first case study examined how female consumers interpreted nutrition messages differentiated by use of ‘scientific’ and ‘lay person’ keywords to communicate food benefits. These messages were identified from contemporary food advertisements reflecting the current health paradigm incorporating wellness and wellbeing concepts. - the second case study explored female consumers beliefs, attitudes and understanding around the incorporation of an exemplary core food promoted by health authorities as contributing to improved health and wellbeing – baby leafy green vegetables. This case study was designed to gain a better understanding of contemporary food choice behaviours within the evolving health, wellness, wellbeing paradigm. - the third case study explored if the terms wellness and wellbeing were meaningful to groups of women typically targeted for nutrition interventions and identify if there were any perceived relationships with food choice and these terms. - the fourth and fifth case studies were ethnographic in nature specifically exploring the perspectives of the meaningfulness of the terms wellness, wellbeing and its relationship to food choice with: women involved in a weight-loss trial to manage overweight and obesity; and the dietary-trial dietitians’ working with these women. Hence to address the second aim the first two case studies provided data around food choice decisions and purported behaviours through examining how nutrition messages are being interpreted and how food choices appear to be enacted. The third case study provided data on how these terms were being interpreted by women commonly targeted for nutrition intervention to address the first aim. The fourth and fifth case study provided data on interpreting how dietary change implementation might be interpreted within the evolving paradigm of wellness and wellbeing to address the first and third aim. These final two case studies included in-depth thematic analysis of female participants’ interviews (n = 34) in a 12 month weight loss trial at initial and end stage time points as well as Dietetic practitioner stakeholders (n= 7) delivering dietary advice as part of the weight-loss trial. Inductive analysis of qualitative data was used to describe the way these terms were perceived to be related to food behaviour. The findings from these studies have been used to develop a new theoretical framework of wellness, wellbeing and food choice for <b>use</b> in <b>Dietetic</b> practice with overweight and obese women. The framework involves reference to four dominant themes: Desired outcomes (most sought after result); Attaining Control (selfmanagement strategies); Internal Influences (various personal inner factors influencing behaviours); and External Influences (plethora of peripheral factors influencing behaviours). In conclusion ‘wellness and wellbeing’ appear to be meaningful terms for contemporary Australian women. Assisting women to articulate their own notion of a satisfying life with respect to their perspectives of wellness and wellbeing as well as their individual indicators for successful outcome/s for enacting dietary change is a useful starting point for supporting dietary change. Identifying an individual’s specific set of influences that may support or impede change may also provide an opportunity to develop and/or enhance capacity building that would enable health goals to be achieved. This research will contribute to the understanding of patient centred Dietetic practice and the effective use of language within food-health communications. There are opportunities to develop and evaluate the theoretical framework identified as a tool for practice for both patient self-evaluation and <b>Dietetic</b> practitioner <b>use</b> in weight loss settings. This can occur with women as well as a broader representation of gender, and cultural backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|Older adults, {{especially}} those acutely ill, {{are vulnerable to}} developing malnutrition due {{to a range of}} risk factors. The high prevalence and extensive consequences of malnutrition in hospitalised older adults have been reported extensively. However, there are few well-designed longitudinal studies that report the independent relationship between malnutrition and clinical outcomes after adjustment {{for a wide range of}} covariates. Acutely ill older adults are exceptionally prone to nutritional decline during hospitalisation, but few reports have studied this change and impact on clinical outcomes. In the rapidly ageing Singapore population, all this evidence is lacking, and the characteristics associated with the risk of malnutrition are also not well-documented. Despite the evidence on malnutrition prevalence, it is often under-recognised and under-treated. It is therefore crucial that validated nutrition screening and assessment tools are used for early identification of malnutrition. Although many nutrition screening and assessment tools are available, there is no universally accepted method for defining malnutrition risk and nutritional status. Most existing tools have been validated amongst Caucasians using various approaches, but they are rarely reported in the Asian elderly and none has been validated in Singapore. Due to the multiethnicity, cultural, and language differences in Singapore older adults, the results from non-Asian validation studies may not be applicable. Therefore it is important to identify validated population and setting specific nutrition screening and assessment methods to accurately detect and diagnose malnutrition in Singapore. The aims of this study are therefore to: i) characterise hospitalised elderly in a Singapore acute hospital; ii) describe the extent and impact of admission malnutrition; iii) identify and evaluate suitable methods for nutritional screening and assessment; and iv) examine changes in nutritional status during admission and their impact on clinical outcomes. A total of 281 participants, with a mean (+SD) age of 81. 3 (+ 7. 6) years, were recruited from three geriatric wards in Tan Tock Seng Hospital over a period of eight months. They were predominantly Chinese (83 %) and community-dwellers (97 %). They were screened within 72 hours of admission by a single <b>dietetic</b> technician <b>using</b> four nutrition screening tools [Tan Tock Seng Hospital Nutrition Screening Tool (TTSH NST), Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002), Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), and Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ©) ] that were administered in no particular order. The total scores were not computed during the screening process so that the dietetic technician was blinded to the results of all the tools. Nutritional status was assessed by a single dietitian, who was blinded to the screening results, using four malnutrition assessment methods [Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), body mass index (BMI), and corrected arm muscle area (CAMA) ]. The SGA rating was completed prior to computation of the total MNA score to minimise bias. Participants were reassessed for weight, arm anthropometry (mid-arm circumference, triceps skinfold thickness), and SGA rating at discharge from the ward. The nutritional assessment tools and indices were validated against clinical outcomes (length of stay (LOS) > 11 days, discharge to higher level care, 3 -month readmission, 6 -month mortality, and 6 -month Modified Barthel Index) using multivariate logistic regression. The covariates included age, gender, race, dementia (defined using DSM IV criteria), depression (defined using a single question “Do you often feel sad or depressed?”), severity of illness (defined using a modified version of the Severity of Illness Index), comorbidities (defined using Charlson Comorbidity Index, number of prescribed drugs and admission functional status (measured using Modified Barthel Index; MBI). The nutrition screening tools were validated against the SGA, which was found to be the most appropriate nutritional assessment tool from this study (refer section 5. 6) Prevalence of malnutrition on admission was 35 % (defined by SGA), and it was significantly associated with characteristics such as swallowing impairment (malnourished vs well-nourished: 20 % vs 5 %), poor appetite (77 % vs 24 %), dementia (44 % vs 28 %), depression (34 % vs 22 %), and poor functional status (MBI 48. 3 + 29. 8 vs 65. 1 + 25. 4). The SGA had the highest completion rate (100 %) and was predictive of the highest number of clinical outcomes: LOS > 11 days (OR 2. 11, 95 % CI [1. 17 - 3. 83]), 3 -month readmission (OR 1. 90, 95 % CI [1. 05 - 3. 42]) and 6 -month mortality (OR 3. 04, 95 % CI [1. 28 - 7. 18]), independent of a comprehensive range of covariates including functional status, disease severity and cognitive function. SGA is therefore the most appropriate nutritional assessment tool for defining malnutrition. The TTSH NST was identified as the most suitable nutritional screening tool with the best diagnostic performance against the SGA (AUC 0. 865, sensitivity 84 %, specificity 79 %). Overall, 44 % of participants experienced weight loss during hospitalisation, and 27 % had weight loss > 1 % per week over median LOS 9 days (range 2 - 50). Wellnourished (45 %) and malnourished (43 %) participants were equally prone to experiencing decline in nutritional status (defined by weight loss > 1 % per week). Those with reduced nutritional status were more likely to be discharged to higher level care (adjusted OR 2. 46, 95 % CI [1. 27 - 4. 70]). This study is the first to characterise malnourished hospitalised older adults in Singapore. It is also one of the very few studies to (a) evaluate the association of admission malnutrition with clinical outcomes in a multivariate model; (b) determine the change in their nutritional status during admission; and (c) evaluate the validity of nutritional screening and assessment tools amongst hospitalised older adults in an Asian population. Results clearly highlight that admission malnutrition and deterioration in nutritional status are prevalent and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in hospitalised older adults. With older adults being vulnerable to risks and consequences of malnutrition, it is important that they are systematically screened so timely and appropriate intervention can be provided. The findings highlighted in this thesis provide an evidence base for, and confirm the validity of the current nutrition screening and assessment tools used among hospitalised older adults in Singapore. As the older adults may have developed malnutrition prior to hospital admission, or experienced clinically significant weight loss of > 1 % per week of hospitalisation, screening of the elderly should be initiated in the community and continuous nutritional monitoring should extend beyond hospitalisation...|$|R
