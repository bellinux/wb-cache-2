5|$|In 1949, Mazurkiewicz wrote {{a letter}} to Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security, {{complaining}} of the continued persecution of former Home Army soldiers and he was arrested again. During a two-year pre-trial confinement, Mazurkiewicz was interrogated and tortured—he was beaten and his teeth and hair were forcibly pulled out. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in a show trial, in which the prosecutor submitted a false confession allegedly made by Mazurkiewicz and no defense witnesses were allowed to appear. He remained imprisoned until the amnesty of 1956. Eventually rehabilitated, he was active <b>in</b> <b>organizations</b> which sought to protect former veterans of anti-Nazi resistance and served as vice-president of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, the Polish veterans association. In 1980, during a brief liberalization associated with the first Solidarity period he was promoted to the rank of General.|$|E

The improvement of ICT’s factors decrease the learning cost to solve problem pertaining to the hierarchy <b>in</b> <b>organization.</b> The improvement of NETWORK increases the wage inequality within workers and decreases within managers and entrepreneurs.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the moderating role of locus of control (LOC) {{in the relationship between}} trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> (TiO) and workplace deviant behavior (WDB). Three forms of deviant behavior are identified: interpersonal deviance, production deviance, and property deviance. The regression analyses carried out on a sample of 355 employees show mixed results. Trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> (TiO) demonstrates a negative relationship with production deviance and property deviance. In contrast, trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> (TiO) is positively related to interpersonal deviance. Furthermore, locus of control (LOC) is found to moderate the relationship between trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> (TiO) and deviant behaviors.

40|$|Trust in {{supervisor}} and trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> are argued to be distinct but related constructs, {{each with its}} own set of antecedents and outcomes. Empirical field results supported the proposition. Although trust in {{supervisor and}} trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> were positively and significantly correlated, trust in supervisor was more strongly associated with proximal variables (ability, benevolence, and integrity of supervisor), whereas trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> was more strongly correlated with global variables (perceived organizational support and justice). This conclusion held despite the inclusion of proximal variables in the regression on trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> and the inclusion of global variables in the regression on trust in supervisor. In addition to the differential antecedents of trust in supervisor and trust <b>in</b> <b>organization,</b> the outcomes for both variables were different. Trust in supervisor was related to increased innovative behavior and satisfaction with supervisor, and trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> was related to higher organizational commitment and lower intention to leave. Therefore, the authors provide clear preliminary data on the distinctiveness of trust in supervisor and trust <b>in</b> <b>organization.</b> One implication of this set of results is that organizations should adopt a more holistic approach in building trust, which can be achieved by focusing on the various constituents of the organization and the various levels (e. g., the supervisor level and the organizational level) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} of determinants of hospital organization trust affecting to hospital worker's trust <b>in</b> <b>organization.</b> This study was measured levels of trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> of hospital workers and 5 determinants of organization trust, organizational fairness, consideration, morality, competence and responsibility toward a society. Levels of trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> of hospital workers and determinants of organization trust were assessed using a sample of 190 employees who work at 2 hospitals in Seoul, Kyunggi. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires from november 22 to 29 in 2012 and analyzed SPSS 18 by using t-test, ANOVA and regression analysis. The results of this study indicate that organizational fairness, consideration and responsibility toward a society among 5 determinants were positively related to levels of trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> of hospital workers. Based on these findings, it can be defined that 5 determinants of hospital organization trust influences levels of trust <b>in</b> <b>organization</b> of hospital workers.
