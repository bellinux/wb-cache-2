5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> settlers. The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 miles (40 km) south, {{as a direct result}} of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> terrier.|$|E
5|$|The thorax and abdomen are {{segmented}} {{and have}} a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin. The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings. The forewings, known as tegmina, are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous, the veins providing strength. The legs are terminated by claws for <b>gripping.</b> <b>The</b> hind leg is particularly powerful; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species. The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines {{and there are a}} pair of articulated spurs near its lower end. The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the wings and legs.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} grips used. In Under <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> firmly with <b>the</b> {{back of the}} hands turned towards the body. In Top <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> with <b>the</b> {{knuckles}} turned outwards.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} <b>grips</b> - <b>the</b> palms-down <b>grip</b> and <b>the</b> {{baseball}} bat <b>grip.</b> For <b>the</b> palms-down <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> hands facing downward while holding the ski rope. For <b>the</b> Baseball Bat <b>grip</b> kneeboarders hold <b>the</b> handle just like a baseball bat.|$|R

5|$|In Martin and St. Lucie counties, {{the storm}} was {{considered}} among the worst on record. The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations. At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged 75% of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed {{the third floor of}} the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper. At Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant. A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> railing during the storm. Winds leveled his nearby home. According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia. The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged. While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally. In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100 at the time. Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines. In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway. In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that {{the storm was}} the most severe on record in Fort Pierce.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable is}} itself {{powered by a}} {{stationary}} motor or engine situated in a cable house or power house. The speed at which it moves is relatively constant depending {{on the number of}} units <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> cable at any given time.|$|E
25|$|Latex and {{silicone}} seals {{are easily}} pierced by sharp objects. <b>Gripping</b> <b>the</b> seal with long fingernails {{to pull it}} on or off can cut through the material, while long toenails can damage thin rubber booties when the foot is pushed inside tight-fitting fins.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{overhand}} <b>grip,</b> {{or regular}} <b>grip,</b> is <b>the</b> standard <b>grip</b> used for <b>the</b> horizontal bar. On <b>the</b> overhand <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> hands circle {{the bar with}} {{the backs of the}} hands facing the gymnast.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> reverse <b>grip</b> and underhand <b>grip,</b> is <b>the</b> {{opposite}} of <b>the</b> overhand <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> palms {{of the hands}} face the gymnast. It is similar to <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> used in chin-ups. Forward giant swings are among the skills that use this grip.|$|R

25|$|In the {{official}} press conference after the Toronto start, Matsuzaka stated through his interpreter that <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> American baseball—which is {{slightly larger than}} the Japanese pro ball, with higher seams—had presented some challenges, {{but that he had}} begun making adjustments and felt they were successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} a fast bowler {{needs to do}} is to grip the ball correctly. The basic fast bowling grip to achieve maximum speed is to hold the ball with the seam upright and to place the index and middle fingers close {{together}} {{at the top of the}} seam with the thumb <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> ball at the bottom of the seam. The image to the right shows the correct grip. The first two fingers and the thumb should hold the ball forward of the rest of the hand, and the other two fingers should be tucked into the palm. The ball is held quite loosely so that it leaves the hand easily. Other grips are possible, and result in different balls – see swing and seam bowling below. The bowler usually holds their other hand over the hand <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> ball until the latest possible moment so that the batsman cannot see what type of ball is being bowled.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategy}} of the long sword is different from other strategies {{in that it is}} much more straightforward. In the {{strategy of}} the longsword, it seems that Musashi's ideal was that by mastering <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> sword, it could become a platform used for moving onto the mastery of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu as well as being able to use two broadswords or use a companion sword better.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} forms of {{construction}} for tweezers: two fused, angled pieces of metal, or {{one piece of}} metal bent in half. The bent tweezer is cheaper to manufacture, but gives weaker <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> fused tweezer is more expensive, but allows for a stronger <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> width between {{the tips of the}} tweezers when no force is applied also affects how powerful <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is.|$|R

2500|$|... <b>grips.</b> In <b>the</b> German <b>grip,</b> <b>the</b> palm of {{the hand}} should be {{parallel}} to the drum head and the thumb {{should be on the}} side of the stick. In <b>the</b> French <b>grip,</b> <b>the</b> palm {{of the hand}} should be close to perpendicular with drum head and the thumb should be on top of the stick. In both of these styles, as with most percussion <b>grips,</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum consists of the contact between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger is used as a guide and to help lift the stick off of the drum. <b>The</b> American <b>grip</b> is a hybrid of these two grips. Another known grip is known as <b>the</b> Amsterdam <b>Grip,</b> made famous by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, which is similar to <b>the</b> Hinger <b>grip,</b> except <b>the</b> stick is cradled on the lower knuckle of the index finger.|$|R
25|$|Biletnikoff popularized {{the use of}} Stickum, an {{adhesive}} {{that many}} players applied to their hands to assist with catching and <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> ball. He would apply the substance all over his body and uniform prior to a game, a practice that was later picked up by Raiders cornerback Lester Hayes after Biletnikoff introduced him to it. The use of Stickum was banned by the NFL in 1981.|$|E
25|$|A 2nd-century {{terracotta}} {{relief from}} the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a midwife and the relief shows her {{in the midst of}} a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> handles and the midwife’s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to donate the primary demand valve that the donor is currently breathing from, {{on the principle that}} it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary demand valve, which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of bungee cord which hangs on the neck, and keeps the secondary demand valve tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the head forward and <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|E

50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{motif of}} the Oseberg Style is <b>the</b> so-called <b>gripping</b> beast. <b>The</b> <b>gripping</b> beast motif is what clearly distinguishes the early Viking {{art from the}} styles that preceded it. The chief features of <b>the</b> <b>gripping</b> beast are <b>the</b> paws that <b>grip</b> <b>the</b> borders around it, neighbouring beasts or parts of its own body. The style is also characterized by traditions from the Vendel era, and it is nowadays not generally accepted as an independent style.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people {{that he was getting}} better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because his hands were <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is diurnal and arboreal. The snake's gliding ability, {{while not}} as {{impressive}} {{as that of the}} paradise flying snake (C. paradisi), still makes it capable of moving from tree to tree with relative ease. These snakes are excellent climbers, being able move across even the smallest of branches and even straight up trees with few branches by using the edges of rough bark. They are frequently seen moving up a coconut palm, or up vertical rock faces in graceful curves, <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> somewhat uneven surfaces with their scales. They tend to be nervous, fast-moving snakes, and will attempt to flee if disturbed, but will not generally hesitate to bite if handled. They are mildly venomous, but the venom is not considered to be dangerous to humans. It is intended to assist in subduing fast moving, arboreal prey.|$|E
25|$|Meigle 11 {{is another}} {{recumbent}} monument {{and is the}} largest of the recumbent stones from Meigle. The long sides of the stone have deeply recessed panels with wide borders that once were decorated but are badly worn. The top of the monument is undecorated and has a wide slot at one end. One side of the stone has the sculpted images of three mounted riders accompanied by a dog, behind them is a humanoid figure with an animal's head and gripping two entwined serpents. The other side of the monument is decorated with two intertwined animals followed by a dog and a bear, one above the other, and an unidentified object. To the right of these is a panel of twelve bosses encircled by serpents. At the extreme right is a wheel of seven bosses set within a frame formed of two upright animals with entwined tails and <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> extremities of a human figure in their mouths.|$|E

25|$|In costume, the Ghostfaces share a ritualistic mannerism of <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> {{blade of}} their knife between thumb and {{forefinger}} and wiping it clean of any blood following a murder by drawing their hand from handle {{to the tip of}} the knife. This characteristic was given to the character by stuntman Dane Farwell who wore the costume for many of its scenes in Scream. Each killer is depicted as possessing effective physical abilities, such as the capabilities of nearly flawless stealth, prowling without being detected, moving silently, and efficiently vanishing from their targets' defense. Additionally, the killer tends to display sufficient strength that allows them to overpower victims, such as in Scream 2, in regards to defeating two trained detectives single-handedly. Ghostface is shown to be able to sustain and even ignore severe levels of physical damage, surviving blunt trauma, stabbing wounds and gunshots. Billy, Mickey, Roman, and Jill all had to be shot through the head or multiple times to the chest to be killed, despite having sustained severe injuries prior.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, the Weekly {{published}} {{a story that}} set off a national scandal and preoccupied the public for months. Henry Ward Beecher, a renowned preacher of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church, had condemned Woodhull's free love philosophy in his sermons. But {{a member of his}} church, Theodore Tilton, disclosed to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a colleague of Woodhull, that his wife had confessed Beecher was committing adultery with her. Provoked by such hypocrisy, Woodhull decided to expose Beecher. He ended up standing trial in 1875, for adultery in a proceeding that proved {{to be one of the}} most sensational legal episodes of the era, <b>gripping</b> <b>the</b> attention of hundreds of thousands of Americans: the trial ended with a hung jury; but the church won the case hands down. On November 2, 1872, Woodhull, Claflin and Col. Blood were arrested and charged with publishing an obscene newspaper and circulating it through the United States Postal Service. In the raid, 3,000 copies of the newspaper were found. It was this arrest and Woodhull's acquittal that propelled Congress to pass the 1873 Comstock Laws.|$|E
