50|$|The Rio Hondo outlet {{has four}} main outlet {{passages}} plus a small <b>diversion</b> <b>passage.</b> The San Gabriel outlet has nine large gates installed {{on top of a}} spillway. Dimensions are furnished in the table below.|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} stages of a flood event, the gates on the Rio Hondo side are {{partially}} closed to build a water conservation pool. As long as the pool on the Rio Hondo side of the reservoir is below elevation 201.6 ft (61.4 m) NGVD29, releases are made to accommodate the capacity of the spreading grounds downstream along the Rio Hondo. The spreading grounds are operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to recharge the groundwater basin. Flow reaches the spreading grounds either directly by <b>way</b> of the <b>diversion</b> <b>passage</b> or from a diversion structure in the Rio Hondo downstream of the dam. Both the <b>diversion</b> <b>passage</b> direct from the dam and the diversion structure in the Rio Hondo are operated by the county.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{stopped at}} one end of the Coliseum, where there was a <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> leading through stupendous arches into the interior.|$|R
50|$|The Chhatta Chowk {{is a long}} <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> that {{contains}} a bazaar, or market, located in the Red Fort of Delhi, India.|$|R
60|$|The seats, in fact, {{that were}} in front {{appeared}} to be entirely full, and several persons {{were standing in the}} <b>passage</b> <b>way.</b> Just then a gentleman and lady came up the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> {{to the end of the}} seat where Mr. George and Rollo were sitting. Mr. George and Rollo moved in to make room. They sat down in the space which was thus made for them, without, however, acknowledging Mr. George's politeness even by a look.|$|R
60|$|The {{door was}} near {{one end of}} the house, and it opened into a <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> which {{extended}} back through the whole depth of it. On one side was a row of stalls, or cribs, for the cows. On the other, were doors opening into the rooms used for the family. A very nice looking Dutch woman, who had apparently seen the party from her window, came out through this side door into the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> to welcome them when they came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} officer; [...] "go aft, there, along that <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> {{and you will}} find a door on the lee quarter where you can look out." ...|$|R
50|$|In those times, Aguazul {{was known}} as Sevilla and was an {{important}} trade center {{and one of the}} few <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> for livestock for the inner meat market.|$|R
40|$|Tiankengs {{are formed}} most {{commonly}} {{by the collapse}} of bedrock into underlying caves that contain active rivers. The collapse propagates itself by blocking and diverting the underground streams, so that hydraulic gradients become steeper and the solutional and erosional capacities are enhanced. Most of the volume of a tiankeng is produced by removal of mass by the cave streams. A large and fluctuating discharge is most favorable. As <b>diversion</b> <b>passages</b> form and enlarge, they foster further collapse and diversion. Stress release around the collapse encourages the opening of new fractures with trends that differ from regional fracture patterns. These processes account for the large scale of tiankengs in comparison to the original cave passages...|$|R
60|$|They found {{themselves}} in another long and narrow <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> which led toward the forward part of the ship. The <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> was so narrow {{that they could not}} walk together. So Rollo went first, and Jane came behind. The vessel was rocking gently from the motion of the waves, and Jane had to put her hands out once or twice, first to one side and then to the other of the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> in order to steady herself as she passed along. Presently they came to a place where they had to go up five or six steps, and then to go immediately down again. It was the place where the main shaft passed out from the engine to the paddle wheel. After getting over this obstruction, they went on a a little farther, and then came into a large dining saloon, where several long tables were spread, and a great many passengers were seated, eating their luncheons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "I {{forgot about}} that. It was {{necessary}} to have <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> leading in from the river, with walls and gates, and with drawbridges over them." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{advanced}} {{to one of}} the openings that was toward the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> and asked which was the way to the coffee room. The girl pointed to the door which led to it, and Rollo went in.|$|R
6000|$|Rollo amused {{himself as}} he walked along observing these various dinner parties, wondering, too, all the time, at the throngs of men that were pouring along through all the spaces and <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> that led towards the gate.[G] ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{looked about}} upon the pier a few minutes, {{and then went}} into the hotel. He passed through a spacious hall, and then through a <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> from which he could look into a large room, the sides of which were formed of glass, so {{that the people who}} were in the room could see out all around them. The front of the room looked out upon the pier, the back side upon the <b>passage</b> <b>way.</b> A third side was toward the vestibule, and the fourth toward the coffee room. There were shelves around this room, within, and tables, and desks, and people going to and fro there. In fact, it seemed to be the office of the hotel.|$|R
2500|$|The Chärstelenbach Bridge has two <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> {{with clear}} widths of [...] each and rails at [...] above low water. The bridge was {{reinforced}} with a fish-belly structure. The modern replacement still uses the centre column {{and the stone}} arch abutments of the original.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, besides," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "they need drawbridges {{across the}} <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> within the docks; for the workmen {{have to go}} back and forth continually, in prosecuting the work of loading and unloading the ships and in warping them in and out." ...|$|R

50|$|The Chärstelenbach Bridge has two <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> {{with clear}} widths of 50 m each and rails at 53 m above low water. The bridge was {{reinforced}} with a fish-belly structure. The modern replacement still uses the centre column {{and the stone}} arch abutments of the original.|$|R
50|$|The tomb has an inscribed <b>passage</b> <b>way.</b> Mose appears {{before a}} {{cartouche}} of Ramesses II. A funerary cone records {{the names of}} Mose's parents. His father Bak was a dignitary (and head of the Works in the Place of Eternity), and his mother's name was Tekhu.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} chambermaid, [...] "you may go, if you must. Dress yourself, {{and go on}} the next deck above this, and walk along the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> that leads aft, and there you'll find a door that you can open and look out. You'll be safe there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, gentlemen," [...] said he, [...] "was Lord Darnley's {{audience}} chamber. That," [...] he continued, pointing {{through an}} open door at the side, [...] "was his bedroom; and there," [...] pointing to another small door on the other side, [...] "was the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> leading up to Queen Mary's apartments." ...|$|R
60|$|So Jane took up her cage, {{and then}} she and Rollo, walking along together, {{followed}} the gentlemen who had {{said that they were}} going down to lunch. They walked forward upon the promenade deck till they came to the short flight of stairs, with the green rope balustrade, which led down to the deck below. These stairs were so steep that the children were obliged to proceed with great caution in descending them, in order to get down in safety. They, however, at length succeeded; and then, passing along where they saw that the gentlemen went who preceded them, they entered into a long and narrow <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> with doors leading to state rooms on either hand. Following this <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> they came at length to a sort of entry or hall, which was lighted by a skylight above. In the middle of this hall, and under the skylight, was a pretty broad staircase, leading down to some lower portion of the ship. As the men whom they were following went down these stairs, the children went down too. When they got down, they found themselves in a perfect maze of cabins, state rooms, and <b>passage</b> <b>ways,</b> the openings into which were infinitely multiplied by the large and splendid mirrors with which the walls were every where adorned.|$|R
60|$|The {{different}} {{portions of}} the lower town, on the other hand, are connected by tunnels and arched <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> under the bridges above described; {{and then there are}} flights of steps, and steep winding or zigzag paths, leading up and down between the lower streets and the upper, in the most surprising manner.|$|R
60|$|Jane and Rollo {{both said}} to Alfred {{that they were}} very much obliged to him, and then, observing that nearly all the {{passengers}} had left the dining saloon and had returned to the cabin, they determined to go too. So they went back through the same <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> by which they had come.|$|R
60|$|At {{the head}} of the stairs was a <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> {{and at the end of}} the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> there was a space upon the deck, which was half enclosed; it being shut in by an awning on the windy side, and open on the other. This place was often resorted to by {{passengers}} who were sick, and who wished for more fresh air than they could have below. There was a row of settees on one side of this space, and, at the time that Rollo came up there, there was a lady lying on one of these settees, apparently in a very forlorn condition. She looked very pale, and her eyes were shut. She was lying upon a mattress, which had been put upon the settee for her, and was covered up with blankets and shawls.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{hesitated a}} little about going down, {{and while he was}} hesitating the boy rose from his seat and came toward the hotel. He entered under the archway, and {{presently}} Rollo heard him coming up the staircase. He then determined to hesitate no longer; so he went out into the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> to see him.|$|R
60|$|High {{up above}} these arches, the sloping platforms, {{on which the}} seats {{formerly}} were placed, were to be seen rising one above another, tier after tier, to a great height, with the ruins of galleries, corridors, and vaulted <b>passage</b> <b>ways</b> passing around among them. The upper surfaces of all these ruins were covered with grass and shrubbery.|$|R
60|$|The arched <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> {{led into}} a square court, with a piazza {{extending}} all around it. The visitors {{turned to the}} left, and walked along under the piazza till {{they came to the}} corner, where there was a little office, and a man at the window of it to give them tickets. They paid sixpence apiece for their tickets.|$|R
50|$|Generation 6 intimidators are {{the first}} non-macro line, stacked tube marker. Named the G6r, the marker was {{released}} in 2011. This model was the standard edition. Bob Long Manufactures released a 2012 edition. This edition was upgraded with a cam-drive ASA, a Frenzy OLED board, and new through air <b>passage</b> <b>ways,</b> with a new pricetag of $999.99.|$|R
60|$|Rollo, in {{the mean}} time, went along the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> bracing his arms against the sides of it as he advanced. The ship was rolling over {{from side to side}} so {{excessively}} that he was borne with his whole weight first against one side of the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> and then against the other, so heavily that he was every moment obliged to stop and wait until the ship came up again before he could go on. At length he came into a small room with several doors opening from it. In the back side of this room was the compartment where the helmsman stood with his wheel. There were several men in this place with the helmsman, helping him to control the wheel. Rollo observed, too, that {{there were a number of}} large rockets put away in a sort of frame in the coil overhead.|$|R

"Two images: The {{first is}} a {{birds-eye}} view depiction of the Tomb of Seti I, while the second is a cross-section showing the tomb and its <b>passages</b> <b>ways</b> in a 3 -D depiction...|$|R
60|$|On {{one side}} of this {{subterranean}} <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> near the entrance, {{there were a number}} of skeletons found. These skeletons were in a standing position against the wall, where the persons had been stopped and buried up by the mud as it flowed in. The marks left by the bodies against the wall remain to this day, and Rollo and all the party saw them.|$|R
50|$|Amenemhat was {{a son of}} the Overseer of lands named Thutmose and {{his wife}} Antef. Amenemhat's wife was named Baketamun. Amenemhat's son who was also named Amenemhat is {{mentioned}} {{in the hall of}} the tomb. This son appears again as a sem-priest in the <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> as does another son named Amenhotep. Two more sons named Amenemwaskhet and Useramun respectively are depicted in the inner room.|$|R
60|$|So {{she rose}} {{and walked up the}} <b>passage</b> <b>way,</b> {{followed}} by the gentleman. She went to one of the forward settees, where there were some ladies sitting who were not very close together, and asked them to move in, so as to make room for her. She then crowded into the space which was thus made, and looked up to her husband with an expression of great satisfaction on her countenance.|$|R
60|$|Besides {{these things}} that were for sale, there were various objects of {{interest}} and curiosity, such as electric machines where people might take shocks, and scales where they might be weighed, and refreshment rooms that were formed in the <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> that was not used for travel; and in one place {{there was a little}} ball room arranged there, where a party might, if they chose, stop and have a dance.|$|R
50|$|By {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, Lisboners grew discontent with the {{outdated}} format of the Passeio and with the triviality of all the activities that took place there. In 1863, the first idea of creating a grand <b>passage</b> <b>way</b> through the park first arose, but it was only in 1873 when the Municipality of Lisbon took the decision to construct a great avenue through the Passeio.|$|R
