5|$|All six {{series and}} {{specials}} were initially available on BBC Worldwide VHS video tapes {{during the late}} 1990s and early 2000s. The Comic Relief Shorts from 1993 and 2001 have not been released on DVD. A One Foot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grave</b> Very Best Of DVD featuring five of the greatest episodes was released on 22 October 2001 in Region 2. Then on 8 July 2004, a One Foot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grave</b> Very Best Of was also released in Region 4. Each series was gradually released on DVD in Region 2 between 2004 and 2006, with a complete series 1-6 box set {{towards the end of}} 2006. A slimmer series 1-6 box set was released in 2010 in Region 2.|$|E

5|$|One Foot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grave</b> was a British BBC {{television}} dark comedy sitcom series {{written by}} David Renwick. There were six series and seven Christmas specials over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The first five series were broadcast between January 1990 and January 1995. For {{the next five}} years, the show appeared only as Christmas specials, followed by one final series in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Salmon {{agreed not}} to {{broadcast}} the episode at Christmas. It was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000, forty minutes in length, rather than usual thirty. The episode's transmission was immediately preceded by I Don't Believe It! The One Foot <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Grave</b> Story, a documentary presented by Angus Deayton which {{looked back at the}} hit sitcom. The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|Michael reconciles {{with his}} family. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as led to believe, but {{killed during the}} heist and buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> marked for Michael. Trevor's {{feelings}} of betrayal cause friction within the group and threaten to undermine their Union Depository plans. When Michael and Dave are betrayed by Steve and become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather, Trevor, feeling {{that he is the}} only one that has the right to kill Michael, comes to their aid. Despite not forgiving Michael, Trevor agrees to perform the Union Depository heist and part ways with him afterwards.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> during this process.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 {{after falling}} gravely ill on the {{previous}} Christmas Day. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the chapter house at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, {{and it is possible}} that the stress of this threat caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grave</b> were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience working with Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery. Grave 42 was a deep, wide pit in which a high-status individual was buried on top of a wooden bed with iron fittings. The body lying on the bed was most likely that of a woman of very high-ranking noble descent, possibly royalty, as {{the quantity and quality of}} the jewellery found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> is indicative of a woman ranking at the top of Anglo-Saxon society. Such burials are highly unusual; only a dozen are known in the whole of the UK, and the one at Street House is the most northerly known.|$|E

An examination of the find assemblages shows that <b>the</b> material culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> had a heterogeneous origin. <b>The</b> <b>graves</b> <b>in</b> Birka with objects from the Finnish mainland can thus be said to display cultural hybridity...|$|R

5|$|Wealthy Egyptians {{were buried}} with larger {{quantities}} of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, {{books of the}} dead were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor {{for them in the}} afterlife. Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

50|$|The Hopi Indians had {{a special}} prayer-stick to which a small bag of sacred meal was attached. Green and blue prayer-sticks are often found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pueblo <b>graves</b> and {{especially}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceremonial <b>graves</b> of Arizona.|$|R
5|$|The Guilden Morden boar is of Anglo-Saxon origin, so {{marked by}} the {{additional}} items found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave,</b> and by comparable helmets discovered elsewhere in England, although until 1977 it was misidentified as Celtic. It was likely once mounted atop a boar-crested helmet, a number {{of which have been}} either found in archaeological excavations or seen in artistic depictions. Two other boar-crested helmets are known—from Benty Grange and from Wollaston—and the Guilden Morden boar is a close parallel of the boar fixed to the former. The Benty Grange boar has a similar shape; it has a long and distinctive elongated snout projecting forward, a similar stance, and front and hind legs each joined as one. It dates to approximately 650 to 700 AD and the Wollaston helmet to the time around 675 AD, although a date more specific than the sixth or seventh century AD has not been suggested for the Guilden Morden boar.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's {{body was}} {{unloaded}} from the Victory at the Nore. It was conveyed upriver in Commander Grey's yacht Chatham to Greenwich {{and placed in}} a lead coffin, and that in another wooden one, made from the mast of L'Orient which had been salvaged after the Battle of the Nile. He lay in state in the Painted Hall at Greenwich for three days, before being taken upriver aboard a barge, accompanied by Lord Hood, chief mourner Sir Peter Parker, and the Prince of Wales. The Prince of Wales at first announced his intention of attending the funeral as chief mourner, but later attended in a private capacity with his brothers when his father George III reminded him that it was against protocol for the Heir to the Throne to attend the funerals of anyone except members of the Royal Family. The coffin was taken into the Admiralty for the night, attended by Nelson's chaplain, Alexander Scott. The next day, 9 January, a funeral procession consisting of 32 admirals, over a hundred captains, and an escort of 10,000 soldiers took the coffin from the Admiralty to St Paul's Cathedral. After a four-hour service he was interred in the crypt within a sarcophagus originally carved for Cardinal Wolsey. The sailors charged with folding the flag draping Nelson's coffin and placing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grave</b> instead tore it into fragments, with each taking a piece as a memento.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Roman Empire, the canton of Lucerne was settled by the Alamanni, who generally settled away from the Roman settlements. Some exceptions include a Roman manor at Büron and the Roman town of Sursee. An Alamannic grave field was found at Aesch with 61 graves with wooden coffins from before the 7th century before. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> women's <b>graves</b> there were necklaces with glass and amber beads, while swords were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> men's <b>graves.</b> Belt buckles and small iron knives were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>graves</b> of both sexes.
