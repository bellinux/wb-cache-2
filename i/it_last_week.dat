500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw <b>it</b> <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for <b>it.</b> <b>Last</b> <b>week</b> saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
