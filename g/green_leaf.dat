40|$|Enterococcus faecalis is a coccal Gram-positive {{bacteria}} with facultative anaerob feature. NaOCl {{have been}} proven effective againts Enterococcus faecalis for root canal irrigation process. <b>Green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract (Camellia sinensis) can be chosen as an alternative solution for root canal irrigation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to determine the difference of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract (Camellia sinensis) and NaOCl 2. 5 % efficacy againts the growth of Enterococcus faecalis bacteria. This is a laboratory experimental study with “post test only group” design. The first step of the trial was done by making <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract and then determine the lowest concentration on which the first solution become clear. The concentration that were tested are 1. 5 %, 2. 5 %, 3. 5 %, 4. 5 % and 5. 5 %. Based on the trial, it was found that the minimal inhibiton concentration of the <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract was 1. 5 %. The anti-bacterial effect testing method was using diffusion method to differenciate inhibition zone of the <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract solution on various concentrations that were being tested and compare it with NaOCl 2. 5 %. Each group was replicated three times. The obtained data was analyzed with One Way Anova test and the continued with LSD test. The result of the study is that NaOCl 2. 5 % have superior anti-bacterial effect againts Enterococcus faecalis compared to <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> extract...|$|R
40|$|Green tea {{is one of}} a herbal nature {{which has}} been proved its special virtue anti acne. Green tea leafcontains of 30 - 40 % polifenol which is known as katekin has a {{characteristic}} as antimicroba. To make it easierto use, the extrac etanolic of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> is made in cream formulation. The purpose of this experiment is toknow variation concentration effect of green tea etanolic extract in cream formulation to the physic andantibacteria activity especially for the acne bacteria, also in spesific concentration will be find the best ofextrac etanolic <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> toward physic characteristic and anti bacterial activity. In this experiment, the thick extrac of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> is obtained by maseration way of the using 50 %etanol liquid. The cream is made in five formulas that is using the extrac etanolic of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> for 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % and 9 % concentration with the modification formula of anti acne cream. Cream is tested the physicalcharacteristic including the homogenity, isolation percent, spreading, and adhesing and also for antibacterialactivity. The data is analysed by non parametric statistical using Kruskal Wallis test continued by doing MannWhitney test with 95 % of trust capacity. The result in this experiment showes that the cream of extrac etanolic form of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> in anycream concentration have good homogenity and did not isolation. As biger concentration of cream extracetanolik of <b>green</b> tea <b>leaf</b> as a smaller spreading test and adhesing test but as a biger antibacterial activitytoward Staphylococcus aureus bacterial.

25|$|The <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> area {{of plants}} and trees in the {{rainforest}} varies by about 25% {{as a result of}} seasonal changes.

Some researchers found that this plant species has two different defenses for when it is being fed on and when a butterfly is in oviposition.

25|$|Notable {{trees in}} the {{preserve}} include valley oak and blue oak. The valley oak was once common in central California, forming large groves along rivers and streams. In grasslands, they form open savannas along with blue oaks. The valley oak is {{the largest of the}} native California oak trees and can live to be 600 years old. With a vertical root system as deep as 80 feet, it can reach groundwater levels. The blue oak tolerates dry soil and can have a root system 30 feet deep. It has a distinctive blue tint in the <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> color that can best be seen when compared to another nearby oak of a different type. The blue oak can live to be 400 years old and provides critical winter range for deer and other wildlife.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{the rules}} of botanical nomenclature, the oldest {{properly}} published name for a species has priority over newer names. [...] Bartram applied the Linnaean binomial Palma elata to a [...] "large, solitary palm with an ashen white trunk topped by a <b>green</b> <b>leaf</b> sheath [...] and pinnate leaves" [...] growing in central Florida. [...] While no type collection is known, {{there are no other}} native palms that would fit Bartram's description. [...] In 1946 Francis Harper pointed out that Bartram's name was valid and proposed a new combination, Roystonea elata. [...] Liberty Hyde Bailey's use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus, established its usage.|$|E
