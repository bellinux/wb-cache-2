5|$|On March 7, 2011, the Oregon Senate President and Speaker of the House {{released}} a statement that Goldschmidt's Governor's portrait {{had been removed from}} the walls of the State Capitol building in Salem and put into storage, out of respect for <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rhys-Davids, in {{a letter}} home written on 25 September {{mentioning}} his victory claim, {{did not know the}} name of <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b> However, another letter of the 28th mentioned Voss by name. Also, on 28 September, after five days as a nonflying orderly officer, V. P. Cronyn was shipped off to another noncombat post with combat fatigue, a belated casualty.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did not mean to kill <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b> The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|All {{but one of}} <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> {{were black}} women. One of <b>his</b> {{suspected}} <b>victims</b> was a black man. Many of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> were sex workers. One witness recalls that Franklin frequently brought sex workers into his home. He shot all of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> with a [...]25 caliber gun. Franklin took many photographs of nude women and kept the records in his garage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>victims</b> {{included}} two adult women; Paulinah Ledwaba and Elizabeth Senwamadi. He also killed five youths, {{only two of}} whom could be identified; Ronald Maoka and Emmanuel Mavuka. Sidyno assaulted and strangled <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> before re-clothing them and covering their bodies with brush. He was noted for removing <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> shoes and placing them neatly next to their bodies.|$|R
25|$|All of Gacy's known murders were {{committed}} inside his Norwood Park ranch house. <b>His</b> <b>victims</b> were typically induced to his address by force or deception, {{and all but}} one of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> were murdered by either asphyxiation or strangulation with a makeshift tourniquet; <b>his</b> first <b>victim</b> was stabbed to death. Gacy buried 26 of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> in the crawl space of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the Des Plaines River.|$|R
5|$|White Zombie is a 1932 American Pre-Code horror film {{directed}} and independently produced by Victor and Edward Halperin. The screenplay by Garnett Weston, based on The Magic Island by William Seabrook, {{tells the story}} of a young woman's transformation into a zombie at the hands of an evil voodoo master. Béla Lugosi stars as the antagonist, Murder Legendre, with Madge Bellamy appearing as <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b> Other cast members included Robert W. Frazer, John Harron, and Joseph Cawthorn.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of <b>his</b> <b>victim,</b> in close {{proximity}} to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked to death with a sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E
5000|$|Pierre Williams {{denied the}} three murders in court. Williams {{apparently}} killed <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> for [...] "sexual pleasure." [...] Williams also mixed some of <b>his</b> <b>victim's</b> blood with coconut {{oil in a}} probable reenactment of a Biblical sacrifice.|$|R
2500|$|A {{major reason}} why neither Adam nor Brad has been {{identified}} is because Eyler did not know who they were, {{unlike the rest of}} <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b> In addition, he was known to dispose of any identification that he would find on <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b> Hoping to make a plea bargain, Eyler had made a list of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> while awaiting execution in the 1990s for a 1984 murder in Chicago. He died of AIDS before his execution date.|$|R
25|$|Although Nilsen {{admitted}} to engaging in masturbation as he viewed the nude bodies {{of several of}} <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> and to have engaged in sexual acts with six of his victims' bodies, he was adamant he had never penetrated any of <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two nights later, on 9 April, he {{accounted}} for another He 111 {{followed by another}} plus a probable victory on 11 April. It is possible <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> on the later mission was He 111P-2, Werknummer 2002, 1G+HT of 9./KG 27. Pilot Leo Roth and crew members Oberfeldwebel Wilhelm Franke, and Unteroffizier Walter Rüggeberg and Fritz Unterieser were killed. A pilot from 307 Squadron also claimed the machine which crashed at Prowers Farm, Lydlinch, Dorset at 01:35. One 8./KG 55 He 111 was lost with its crew over the Channel and a Stab./KG 26 machine was lost over northern France when the crew abandoned their damaged aircraft. Cunningham's comrade in 604, Roderick Aeneas Chisholm, {{accounted for}} a 5./KG 54 Ju 88 near Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|At the party, Veronica {{notices that}} the “rape coasters” which test for date rape drugs do not {{actually}} work. Veronica, Mac, and Piz test various peoples’ cups and find nothing. After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, {{he pulls out a}} gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b> Veronica tases Mercer, and they have a quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out an intruder operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests {{the victim of the}} crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. <b>His</b> <b>victim</b> was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E
50|$|In several instances, Corll forced <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> {{to either}} phone {{or write to}} their parents with {{explanations}} for their absences {{in an effort to}} allay the parents' fears for their sons' safety. Corll is also known to have retained keepsakes—usually keys—from <b>his</b> <b>victims.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1980, William Bonin {{and four}} known accomplices {{were arrested for}} a series of killings known as the Freeway Murders. The murders {{committed}} by Bonin and his accomplices display a markedly similar disposal method as that of Kraft. Bonin is also known to have tortured <b>his</b> <b>victims,</b> although he never plied <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> with alcohol or drugs. In addition, although he is known to have stabbed some victims' genitalia with a knife and to have stabbed one victim to death, Bonin never mutilated his victims' bodies and almost all of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> were strangled to death with their own T-shirt. Moreover, Bonin's victims were younger than those of Kraft, with the age range of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> being 12 to 19 years.|$|R
50|$|As a {{professional}} corporate spy and mercenary, Cypher {{has the ability}} to hypnotize <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> into obeying <b>his</b> every command using his precise voice, an ability he often uses to force them to suicide. His voice {{can also be used to}} put <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> to sleep.|$|R
5|$|Loxton {{returned}} {{in the next}} match and claimed both openers to end with 2/27 from 19 overs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 138 in their first innings. He then made a duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. Loxton bowled six overs and took 0/15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Loxton did little, scoring two in his only innings and taking a match total of 1/32, <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> being Test batsman Jack Ikin. In the non-first-class game against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Loxton made 15 in Australia's 282 and then took 1/8 from six overs as the hosts reached 5/73 before rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b> As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

5|$|Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes forced <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> {{to destroy}} {{forensic}} evidence. He was only caught {{after one of}} <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> deliberately pulled out her own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him to the attacks. She was inspired by watching the CSI television series.|$|R
50|$|Untraceable (2008) stars Diane Lane as an FBI Cyber Crimes {{agent who}} is after {{a serial killer}} who hooks <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> up to {{machines}} set up to where the speed in which <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> die, corresponds {{to the number of}} views the live internet stream of the victims receives.|$|R
50|$|Bartsch began {{killing at}} the age of fifteen. <b>His</b> first <b>victim</b> was Klaus Jung who was murdered in 1962. <b>His</b> next <b>victim</b> was Peter Fuchs who was killed four years later in 1965. He persuaded all of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> to {{accompany}} him into an abandoned air-raid shelter, where he forced them to undress and then sexually abused them. He dismembered <b>his</b> first four <b>victims.</b> <b>His</b> intended fifth <b>victim,</b> 15-year-old Peter Frese, however, escaped by burning through his bindings with a candle that Bartsch had left burning after leaving the shelter. Bartsch was arrested in 1966.|$|R
25|$|The rapist must marry <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> if she chooses.|$|E
25|$|On the 2nd {{day of the}} test, Nathan Lyon {{took his}} first wicket in tests with his first ball, <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> was Kumar Sangakkara; he is the 14th {{international}} player and 2nd Australian to do so. He finished with figures of 5/34, becoming the 131st player to take five wickets on debut in a Test match. Also, Trent Copeland took his first wicket in tests with his second ball; <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> was Tillakaratne Dilshan.|$|E
25|$|The {{tree was}} nicknamed kakure-ichō (hiding ginkgo), {{deriving}} from an Edo period urban legend which {{told of a}} suspected assassin hiding behind it before striking <b>his</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ray sexually {{tortured}} and presumably killed <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> using whips, chains, pulleys, straps, clamps, leg spreader bars, surgical blades, and saws. It {{is thought that}} he terrorized many women with these tools for many years, while living in New Mexico, with the added assistance of multiple accomplices, allegedly including several of the women he was dating.Inside the torture room, along with numerous sex toys, torture implements, syringes, and detailed diagrams showing different methods and techniques for inflicting pain, there was a homemade electrical generator that was used for torture. A mirror was mounted in the ceiling, above the gynecologist-type table he used to strap <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> to. Ray would also put <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> in wooden contraptions that bent them over and immobilized them while he had his dogs rape them and sometimes other friends. He has been said to have wanted <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> to see everything he was doing to them during the torture sessions. Ray would often have a recorded audio tape of himself played for <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> whenever they regained consciousness.|$|R

50|$|A serial-murderer is on {{the loose}} who just so happens to also be {{removing}} the hearts of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> and taking them with him. <b>His</b> <b>victims</b> however, are not merely random humans as thought by the police. They are in fact, {{the past and present}} guardians of the gateway of the afterlife.|$|R
25|$|His {{motives for}} these murders are unclear. In one case, <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> left him {{a legacy of}} £500, but he gained nothing from the other two victims.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the first Test, Nathan Lyon took his first wicket in tests with his first ball, <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> was Kumar Sangakkara; he is the 14th {{international}} player and 2nd Australian to do so.

Also, Trent Copeland took his first wicket in tests with his second ball; <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> was Tillakaratne Dilshan. Also in the first test the ICC admitted that the hawk-eye or eagle-eye made an error.|$|E
25|$|Once he {{had tied}} up <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> on the bed, Ireland again demanded his victim's bank details. This time <b>his</b> <b>victim</b> refused to comply. After killing Collier's cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier's penis {{and placed the}} dead cat's mouth over it, and placed the cat's tail into Collier's mouth. Ireland was angered at {{discovering}} Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking why they had not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with £70.|$|E
50|$|He {{had been}} known to burgle <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> {{but this was not}} his primary motive. He often took money but only small amounts. He has taken credit cards and {{obtained}} their PINs from <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> but there has never been any record of him using them. In 2004 he stole a wad of five pound notes but these were later discovered thrown away {{a mile and a half}} from <b>his</b> <b>victim’s</b> house. He had also taken jewellery. The same year he told a <b>victim</b> that <b>his</b> mother had died four years earlier, stating that “the Government let her down anyway”.|$|R

In his distorted estimation, <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> [...] "mean" [...] something to him, and he may secure keepsakes from victims to memorialize the [...] "relationship". The active shooter also murders at close quarters. He delights in experiencing the horror of <b>his</b> <b>victims</b> as he shares their space. Crucially, however, while {{the victims of the}} serial killer [...] "mean" [...] something to him, to the active shooter they mean nothing.
