5|$|The {{depiction}} of Mars in <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life. Thus originated {{a large number}} of science fiction scenarios, among which is H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, published in 1898, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth.|$|E
5|$|In a 1904 {{novel by}} Charles Whistler {{entitled}} A Prince of Cornwall Glastonbury {{in the days}} of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys's novel A Glastonbury Romance is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail.|$|E
5|$|The music {{composition}} and recording were handled by underground musicians Falk Au Yeong, Funk Fiction, Andy Tunstall, James Landino, DJ Max-E, Mr. Lange, and Li Xiao'an. Daneluz {{had not made}} plans to incorporate original music until Falk approached him requesting collaboration on the game. Funk <b>Fiction</b> <b>has</b> claimed that the music spans more than twenty genres and was influenced by rock, jazz, disco, and trip hop and the soundtracks of game franchises like Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Kirby. Due to the levels in After the Sequel generally taking longer to complete than those in Before the Sequel, the music tracks are longer, estimated by Falk as ranging from one minute and 45 seconds to three minutes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axiel, arborescent, and networked. Axiel hypertext <b>fictions</b> <b>have</b> a central story line with links that branch off {{and return to}} the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked <b>fictions</b> <b>have</b> multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext <b>fiction</b> can <b>have</b> a mixture of these three forms.|$|R

5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
5|$|During the 34 {{nomination}} years, 34 magazines run by 90 editors {{have been}} nominated. Of these, only 8 magazines run by 23 editors have won. Locus won 22 times and was nominated every year until a rules change in 2012 made it ineligible for the category.

25|$|Contemporary science <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> {{been marked}} by the spread of {{cyberpunk}} {{to other parts of}} the marketplace of ideas.

25|$|The {{degree to}} which the story is <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> been disputed. In his {{biography}} of Orwell, George Orwell: A Life, Bernard Crick cast doubt on the idea that Orwell himself actually shot an elephant.

25|$|Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English writer, film director, {{and visual}} artist.

25|$|Contemporary romance, {{which is}} set after World War II, is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in {{the time when they}} are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in {{contemporary}} romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> blurred.|$|E
25|$|Crime and detective <b>fiction</b> <b>has</b> enjoyed wide {{popularity}} in Tamil Nadu since the 1930s.

In the 1950s and '60s, Tamilvanan's detective hero Shankarlal carried readers to a variety of foreign locales, while using a pure Tamil with very few Hindi or English loan words. These writers are often extremely prolific, with hundreds or even thousands of short novels to their credit, and one or more short novel published in a monthly periodical. Indra Soundar Rajan, another popular modern author, writes supernatural crime thrillers usually based around Hindu mythology.|$|E
