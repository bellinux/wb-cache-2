The hospital, {{over a period}} of time, grew to become a 550-bed hospital, and the first nationally accredited hospital in Pune. He was successful in bringing coronary angioplasty, Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, CT Scan, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, image intensifier X-Ray, cadaveric organ donation and the first Image <b>Guided</b> <b>Radio</b> Therapy (IGRT) for cancer to Ruby Hall and thus making it an advanced centre of medical care.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have endeavoured {{to trace the}} {{development}} of radio drama in Great Britain through a selection of plays by authors representative of the various phases through which the form has passed during its growth. I do not pretend to have given a fully documented account of all the important plays by all the important authors. That would require {{easy access to the}} British Broadcasting Corporation script library. Therefore the length of the chapters should not be taken as any indication of the relative importance of the phases. Owing to the scarcity of bibliographies and the fact that not all those radio plays which have been published were obtainable, there are many gaps which I regret I have been unable to fill. I am also conscious of not having done justice to many authors, particularly Mr. V. G. Gielgud O. B. E., who, as Head of Drama for the BBC, has <b>guided</b> <b>radio</b> drama from its infancy in 1928 to the present day...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Tongue is {{a mobile}} organ in {{head and neck}} region predisposing it for {{geographic}} miss {{during the course of}} fractionated radiotherapy for tongue malignancy. This study analyses movement of tongue during the course of radiotherapy using volumetric KV-cone beam computed tomography (KV-CBCT) imaging for patients of tongue malignancy treated without using tongue bite. Methods: We analysed 100 KV-cone beam CTs performed on 10 patients with carcinoma of tongue undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. All the patients underwent thermoplastic mask immobilisation and CT simulation. During the course of radiotherapy, all patients underwent volumetric KV-CBCT imaging to assess the movements of tongue. Five arbitrary reference points were used to analyse the movements of tongue in 3 -dimensions: 1) Point A: Tip of tongue; 2) Point B: Point over right lateral border, 4 cm posterior to the tip of tongue; 3) Point C: Point over left lateral border, 4 cm posterior to the tip of tongue; 4) Point D: Point over superior most part (dorsum) of tongue, 4 cm posterior to the tip of tongue; 5) Point E: Point over the surface of base of tongue at the level of tip of epiglottis. Results: Mean movements of point A: + 0. 21 cm (SD: 0. 12) and - 0. 23 cm (SD: 0. 14), point B: + 0. 14 cm (SD: 0. 04) and - 0. 19 cm (SD: 0. 1), point C: + 0. 12 cm (SD: 0. 05) and - 0. 14 cm (SD: 0. 06), point D: + 0. 15 cm (SD: 0. 07) and - 0. 29 cm (SD: 0. 22) and point E: + 0. 23 cm (SD: 0. 15) and - 0. 23 cm (SD: 0. 14). Conclusion: Organ movement {{is one of the great}} challenges encountered during radiotherapy. Tongue is one such organ in head and neck region. Concept of internal target volume (ITV) margin which takes into account the internal organ movements should be considered for tongue malignancies. ITV to PTV margin will depend on the setup accuracy, immobilization device and imaging modality utilised for setup verification. In an IGRT (Image <b>Guided</b> <b>Radio</b> Therapy) setup, a PTV margin of 0. 3 to 0. 5 cm from ITV would be safe. </p...|$|E

UNISA has also added videocassettes, telephone teaching, computer-based audio-graphics systems, fax, videoconferencing, email, the internet, and computer-based multimedia in the teaching and assessment of its learning programs (including ABET). The demand for these technologies has been necessitated by the multicultural profile of the University’s students. The paper examines the value of this range of technologies.

After the initial Tuesday broadcast, audio streams of the episode were available until the following Tuesday. For these final phases, the core cast (Simon Jones, Geoffrey McGivern, Mark Wing-Davey, Susan Sheridan and Stephen Moore) returned, along with William Franklyn as the new voice of The Book (assisted by Rula Lenska).
