5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were <b>hired</b> <b>for</b> individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E

5|$|In early 1986, {{maintenance}} problems saw {{a number}} of vehicles banned from use by vehicle examiners from the Ministry of Transport. The company was forced to hire eight vehicles from other companies to keep services running; they remained in the fleet for four weeks while the regular vehicles were repaired. Similar issues resurfaced in February 1987, when twelve vehicles were <b>hired</b> <b>for</b> three weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{thematic}} and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were <b>hired</b> <b>for</b> their genetic disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period.

5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building {{to have a more}} traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were <b>hired</b> <b>for</b> the more orchestral themes.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{construction}} {{began on}} a revamped Route 18 freeway through New Brunswick.
