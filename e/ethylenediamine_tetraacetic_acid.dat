Cellulose synthesis was inhibited substantially in adapted cells. The proportions of total pectin in walls of unadapted and adapted cells were about the same, but substantial amount of uronic acid-rich material from walls of cells adapted to either NaCl or polyethylene glycol was more easily extracted with cold sodium <b>ethylenediamine</b> <b>tetraacetic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions (NM Iraki et al.

We examined the linkage composition of the pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides to ascertain chemical factors that may explain this difference in physical behavior. Adaptation to stress resulted {{in the formation of}} a loosely bound shell of polygalacturonic acid and rhamnogalacturonan.

40|$|Initiation of {{germination}} of heat-activated Streptomyces viridochromogenes spore {{occurs in}} media containing only calcium ions and organic buffer.

MethodsThe interaction between fluconazole and minocycline against polymicrobial planktonic cells and polymicrobial biofilms formed over four different time intervals (4  hours, 8  hours, 12  hours, and 24  hours) was investigated using a microdilution checkerboard method.
