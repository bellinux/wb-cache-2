5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|It {{had a big}} impact. He was a {{founding}} member and really created the vocal style we are known for. Just felt like part of the band died too. Like when he died, it was just weird to think about doing shows or recording without him around, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was no longer in}} the band. He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E
5|$|The Chew Magna {{telephone}} exchange was manually operated until the 1950s. An important number Chew Magna 2 {{was that of}} Dr Terrell Hughes: the exchange operators could often locate him in an emergency <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was away from his home and surgery. The manual exchange served most of the Chew valley and even East Dundry.|$|E

5|$|The case of Jaggard v. Dickinson (1980) {{held that}} even a drunken belief will support the defence even though this allows {{drunkenness}} to negate basic intent; and Lloyd v. DPP (1992) ruled that a motorist who damages a wheel clamp to free his car, having parked on another's property knowing {{of the risk of}} being clamped, does not have a lawful excuse under the Act <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> makes a mistake of law.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|At {{seventeen}} years of age, Watts entered the 2008 season primarily playing school football with Brighton Grammar in the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS) competition, instead of under-18 {{level in the}} TAC Cup with the Sandringham Dragons. He was completing year eleven and could choose to nominate for the AFL draft in either 2008 or 2009; touted as a likely early draft pick despite being a year younger than most of his fellow draft prospects, he spent {{the majority of the}} season undecided on whether he would nominate for the 2008 draft. He did, however, state that he would remain in Victoria in 2009 to complete year twelve at Brighton Grammar <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was recruited by an interstate team.|$|E

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling that Hitler had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E

5|$|In early summer, Jordan Cameron, {{a former}} {{freshman}} basketball player from Brigham Young University, also transferred to USC {{to play football}} as a wide receiver. However, when USC refused to accept some of Cameron's credits from Brigham Young, {{he was forced to}} withdraw and attend Ventura College. He missed the football season but was given the option to try to rejoin the team in 2008. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had stayed at USC, due to NCAA transfer rules he would have been ineligible to play in 2007. Cameron ended up enrolling at USC a year later.|$|E
5|$|In interrogation, Wexler, {{a former}} Stasi colonel, {{explains}} to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable {{because of its}} utility to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> succeeds in bringing the IBBC down {{there are hundreds of}} other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser maintain {{that this is}} unlikely, {{as there is no}} record of the married Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had, he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires.|$|E

He is played by Sarah Silverman's real-life pet dog, Duck.|$|R
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> reached {{the merits of the}} question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold the virtues of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E

Jack Frost, the Easter Bunny and Father Time also made appearances in dreams or tales told by the elders, but cannot really be counted.|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} this is itself controversial.

5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} he at least knew of his VC prior to his death, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E
5|$|Though Murali {{does his}} best to cure Venu, Seetha is worried that Murali might take revenge on her by not {{providing}} proper treatment to Venu, who in the meantime, learms of Murali and Seetha's love. Venu requests Murali to marry Seetha in case the operation is unsuccessful as he does not wish for his wife to become a widow. Seetha becomes infuriated when she discovers Venu's request and tells Murali that if Venu dies, she would die as well. Murali promises Seetha that he will save Venu <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has to risk his own life on the line.|$|E
