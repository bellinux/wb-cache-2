[...] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an [...] "A". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: [...] "I am absolutely loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they're both married now?

500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't wait to hear you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Monday 15 October, roadblocks were set up between Ruatoki and Taneatua by armed police, who searched and {{questioned}} everyone who passed through. After reports that a school bus was stopped and searched, police superintendent Wally Haumaha said these reports were wrong. However, the bus driver told a hikoi four days after the raid: [...] "The police did hop on our bus and they did search our bus ... they always held their rifles." [...] The organiser of the hikoi called on the government to acknowledge the incident and do something for the children affected by it. Speaking on Radio New Zealand she asked [...] "I'd like to ask that question why? [...] <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we're from Ruatoki? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> the majority of children are Māori out here?"

2500|$|Hay {{published}} a magazine piece entitled Philosophy of laughter {{in which he}} discussed the psychology of comedy. In the essay, he stated [...] "Why does {{every one of us}} laugh at seeing somebody else slapped in the face with a large piece of cold custard pie? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we're all naturally cruel? Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> there's something inherently funny in custard pies? Or in faces? Or in throwing things? No. No. and no! The real reason why we laugh is because we are relieved. Because we are released from a sense of fear. Wherever we may happen to be - in the cinema, theatre, or music-hall - we tend to identify with the actors we are watching. So that when a custard pie is thrown we fear for a moment that it as been thrown at us. And then, immediately we realise that it hasn't hit us, we experience a feeling of relief, and we laugh".|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a highly practical program specializer for Java programs.

These properties {{are the result of}} (1) a new algorithm for selecting specializable code fragments, based on a notion of influence; (2) a precise store profile for identifying constant heap locations; and (3) an efficient invalidation mechanism for monitoring optimistic assumptions about heap constants. Our implementation of the specializer in the Jikes RVM has low overhead, selects specialization points that would be chosen manually, and produces speedups ranging from a factor of 1. 2 to 6. 4, comparable with annotationguided specializers...|$|R

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the meeting}} {{when one of}} the Princes {{nominated}} Prince Yodying Prayurayot Krom Muen Bovorn Vichaichan as the next Front Palace, many in the council objected. The most notable objection of this nomination came from Prince Vorachak Tharanubhab. The Prince argued that the appointment of such an important position was the sole prerogative of the king and not of the council, and that the council should wait until the king was old enough to appoint his own. Furthermore, the position was not hereditary and the appointment of the son of the former could set a dangerous precedent. [...] The nomination [...] of Vichaichan however was supported by the powerful Regent Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag) who wanted to secure a line of succession by appointing an able and experienced Front Palace (as the first-in-line to the throne). Si Suriyawongse was determined, he retorted by accusing the Prince of wanting to be appointed himself, saying: [...] "You don't agree. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> you want to be (Uparaja) yourself?" [...] ("ที่ไม่ยอมนั้น อยากจะเป็นเองหรือ"). The Prince replied wearily [...] "If you want me to agree then I agree" [...] ("ถ้าจะให้ยอมก็ต้องยอม"). As a result, Prince Vichaichan, at the age of 30, was appointed Front Palace (Krom Phra Rajawang Bovorn Sathan Mongkol) and Second King without the full consent of the incoming monarch. The relationship between Chulalongkorn and the Vichaichan would remain difficult {{for the rest of the}} latter's life, based on this fact. On 11 November 1868 Vichaichan's cousin Chulalongkorn was crowned Supreme King of Siam at the Grand Palace.|$|E
2500|$|In short, {{he shifted}} {{attention}} to the perception of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes {{that he is not}} concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, how are we to note the pronunciation of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.) People may pronounce a word {{in a variety of ways}} and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not [...] "that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality" [...] (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds [...] "are classified according to their similarity" [...] (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word [...] "green" [...] can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for [...] "green". In such cases, people might classify what we would call [...] "green" [...] as either [...] "yellow" [...] or [...] "blue". This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.|$|E
