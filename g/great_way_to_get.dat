500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

50|$|Now that {{colleges have}} {{accepted}} the fact that students commit suicide people {{have come up with}} multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> help college students. Counseling has been a very common <b>way</b> <b>to</b> receive help and not only do they help with suicidal people, but they also help with other mental health issues. And for those people who fall between the cracks and feel like counseling isn't for them. There is rehab where specialized doctors are there for people and they focus on the persons specific needs. Hotlines also exist and they can be very helpful to someone who is shy or nervous to go out and show themselves. Instead they can call a support line and someone is always ready to support or talk with the person about whatever they want they're there to support the person and possibly give them that talk that they have been needing/seeking. Other <b>great</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help is by helping yourself set good habits, eat healthier, exercise, join a club of some sort, and think positive. Doing these things have been found to reduce chances in suicide.|$|R

In about three miles or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, and see where I was.|$|R
40|$|As many of today’s social {{scientists}} (such as Beck, Giddens, Howard, Vlăsceanu etc) have remarked, {{the modern age}} has brought with itself a great series of fast-paced changes in the average man’s lifestyle. Nothing is safe or can {{be taken for granted}} anymore. Families disintegrate, traditions become obsolete and professional re-qualifications are necessary every few years just to keep upwith the younger, tougher competition on the labour market. Forced to constantly changed ones place of residence, ones entourage, work and habits leads to a feeling of loneliness, of not really being a part of modern society and its communities, of being left out to fend for yourself. Luckily, modernity has also brought with itself a never seen before technological boom which instantly permitted not only the improvement of one’s biological life, but also provided society with the opportunity {{to bridge the gap between}} people. One of the most significant of these innovations is the Internet, a non-geographical space that people, in just a few short years, have colonized andmade their own, projected their identities into and created solid and durable communities that, which were less subjected to being torn apart by distance and time. This paper’s object is to show how and why being part of an online community is a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> for one <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a stronger feeling of social integration and be part of a somewhat more fair, less prejudiced world...|$|R

50|$|While {{adding a}} soil {{conditioner}} to crops or a garden {{can seem like}} a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> healthier plants, over-application of some amendments can cause ecological problems.

40|$|Service-learning is a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> for ELLs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{involved}} in the community, develop interpersonal communication skills, and do research on social issues, {{but it can be}} an overwhelming course to develop. This presentation will outline how one IEP successfully developed a service-learning course and offer tips {{for those who want to}} develop their own. In Summer 2012, a team was organized <b>to</b> examine the <b>ways</b> in which service-learning could be implemented at our university’s IEP. This “Creative Team” explored both curricular and extra-curricular options, and after surveying students and examining other models of service-learning courses, the team decided to pursue the development of a service-learning elective course for upper-intermediate and advanced students in the IEP’s Academic English Program. The following semester, they worked on the development of the course goals, objectives, student learning outcomes and assessments, and a general weekly schedule. The course was launched in Spring 2013, with strong student enrollment. In this session, presenters will describe the steps they followed to develop this course. They will explain the survey questions used to gauge student interest in service-learning and the results from that student survey. They will share the service-learning course guide and class schedule, so that others can use it as a model. They will also discuss various class activities and lessons that were used in the course. Finally, they will talk about what the student’s experiences were. The session will also cover the basic principles of service-learning to discuss how it differs from general volunteering or community service and how it fits in academic courses. Participants will be encouraged to share ideas and ask questions. All attendees will leave with a handout highlighting the session’s main points, including a bibliography of resources for future reference...|$|R
40|$|The email was {{addressed}} {{not only to}} me, but also to all the Project Knowledge Sharing Community at Ames Research Center. We were invited to sit in on a major project review as a new experiment in knowledge sharing. This first-of-its-kind opportunity had been conceived by Claire Smith, who leads the knowledge sharing program, as well as heading up the Center's Project Leadership Development Program and serving as coordinator of the APPL-West program at Ames. The objective was to offer Ames project practitioners the opportunity to observe project-review processes as they happen. Not that I haven't participated in my share of project reviews, but this seemed like a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up-to-date about a new project, the Kepler mission, and to experience a review from a new perspective.

How much time do I have left? What {{are they going to}} ask me?' So when Claire's email pinged on my computer, I quickly responded by asking her to save a place for me. It was to be an informational review about progress on the project: what the team had done, where they were going, and what they needed <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there. There were people on the project team from all over the United States, {{and it was the first}} time for them <b>to</b> <b>get</b> together from all aspects of the project. For our part, as observers, we were asked to abide by a couple of rules: Don't ask any questions. and don't talk about the specifics of what we saw or heard. The idea was that we weren't supposed to be noticed. We weren't to buzz around and bother people. Hence the name for this experinient: Fly on the Wall...|$|R

Last semester the requirement {{was to do}} an internship with a company that had you helping with activities that pertained to your individual major, which for me was Business Management. This spring semester, our requirement is to now present our internship experience at the Undergraduate Research and Scholarship Conference. Throughout my four years of college I {{have been able to}} now complete two internships. By taking part in each of the internships, I have enjoyed having the opportunity to learn about business, business management, and the different aspects involved in business. The two internships I have participated in were two very different experiences and have showed how different yet similar businesses can be no matter the size of the company or the industry one pursues. The internship I did for the fall 2011 semester was for Chrysalis Salon Professional Products. Chrysalis is a distributor for Idaho, Montana, and Washington and distributes different manufactures’ salon exclusive products. This sole proprietorship consisted of my supervisor, the CEO of the company, and me. This was a <b>great</b> <b>way</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved in all of the different departments involved in business, even though the internship experience was on a very small scale. I was able to see a simplified example of accounting, marketing, management, inventory, organizational planning, and sales. During my internship I was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some hands on experience and see the real world of daily business activity. There were many objectives and projects I was able to accomplish during my internship and many ways I was able to relate what I was learning in class to what I was doing in the workplace.
