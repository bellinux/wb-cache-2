40|$|Abstract: Current {{issues of}} energy saving in cement production, using {{technological}} milling complex, {{which includes a}} press roller crusher and ball mill, discussed in the article. Optimized milling conditions of previously ground material through the installation of energy-exchange blade devices (EBD) in amill drum have been proposed. It {{was found that the}} level of charge by grinding media in the first chamber periodically varies according to the rotation angle of the mill drum equipped with EBD. There is a "scooping " of the grinding media with a grinding material in the zone of active influence of EBD along, lifting them to a height and enforcing them a cross-longitudinal movement. All that is different from being created in the ball mills without EBD. The additional work is performed, which consumes engine power. Method of calculating anadditional power consumption of the mill drive equipped with EBD was proposed; additional power expended to create cross-longitudinal motion of the grinding mediain the first and second chambers initsareas of activein fluence of EBD. The comparative analysis of the results obtainedby experiment and calculation son the proposed equationss howed high convergenceresults. The analytical dependencies maybe of interest for both Russian and foreign organizations operating in the design and manufacture of cement equipment, as well as for cement manufacturers.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} project was the {{development}} of a strategy for the process control of comminution processes in stirred <b>ball</b> <b>grinders.</b> In a test stand a real-time on-line measuring technique has been installed, calibrated and tested. The volume-specific surface as the control parameter is followed by a turbidimetric sensor. A system analysis revealed the significance of influencing parameters {{and the quality of the}} process signals. Time-discrete models were used for the description of the dynamical behaviour of the stirred <b>ball</b> <b>grinder.</b> Local model parameters can be used for the parametrization of digital control algorithms. A control conception has been developed and implemented for quality maintenance of the ground material.

30|$|Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} using a soil corer 6.37  cm in diameter. Samples were taken at depths of 0 – 10  cm, 10 – 20  cm, and 20 – 30  cm, with sample for each depth range being composited from at least 6 sampling locations within each subplot. Soil samples were air-dried and ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve. A subsample of soils was finely ground using a <b>ball</b> <b>grinder</b> (Oscillating Mill MM 400 by Retsch, Newtown, PA, USA) for C analysis. Bulk density was determined using the core method. Stone content was assessed based on field observations based on the menu of the Munsell Soil Color Chart. Soil C stocks were calculated by multiplying C concentration by bulk density, stone contents, and soil horizon thickness.|$|R
30|$|The {{samples were}} open air dried on trays {{for a period}} of one week and then oven dried at a {{temperature}} of 105 °C (± 5 °C) for 2 to 4 hours at the laboratory. The oven dried samples were then grounded into fine powder with a stainless steel <b>ball</b> <b>grinder.</b> The prepared samples, in powdered form, were packed into weighed one (1) liter Marinelli plastic beaker, hermetically sealed, reweighed and stored prior to counting (Scheibel and Appoloni 2007); (Changizi et al. 2010); (Olatunde et al. 2011). The containers were sealed to avoid any possibility of out-gassing of radon and kept {{for a period of}} 1 month to make sure the samples attained radioactive equilibrium between Ra- 226 and its decay products in the uranium series, and Ra- 228 and its decay products in the thorium series (Tahir and Alaamer 2009).|$|R
50|$|A typical type of fine <b>grinder</b> is the <b>ball</b> mill. A {{slightly}} inclined or horizontal {{rotating cylinder}} is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind {{material to the}} necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is {{at one end of}} the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of Portland cement and finer grinding stages of mineral processing, one example being the Sepro tyre drive Grinding Mill. Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5 m (28 ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor, drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world's power (see List of countries by electricity consumption). However, small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.|$|R

30|$|In April 2015, three soil {{profiles}} {{were selected}} in a 25  ×  20  m subplot of each site. Because slope {{can affect the}} estimation of SOC stocks, we chose profiles that had slopes between 5 ° and 10 °. Soil carbon stocks within 0 – 50  cm soil of all land-use types was estimated for comparing soil carbon under the same depths since the depth of soil under bamboo forest was around 50  cm. Therefore, three samples were collected at specific intervals from the surface to 50  cm depth (0 – 5, 5 – 10, 10 – 30 and 30 – 50  cm) of each soil profile. Collected soil samples were air dried, ground, passed through a sieve (< 2  mm), and stored for chemical and physical properties analyses and estimation of SOC stocks. Before soil sample collections, three samples at each depth were collected with volumetric cores for determining bulk density (BD). Core-collected soil samples were oven dried (105  °C) to constant weight prior to calculating their BDs (Blake and Hartge 1986). Particle size {{was determined by the}} pipette method (Gee and Bauder 1986). Soil pH was measured in deionized water (water–soil ratio 1 : 1) by glass electrode (McLean 1982). Soil samples were finely ground using a <b>ball</b> <b>grinder</b> (Oscillating Mill MM 400; Retsch, Newtown, PA, USA) before SOC and N analysis. A CHN analyzer (Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN; Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) was used to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen. The CEC of the soil was carried out using NH 4 -acetate buffer solution (pH 7; Thomas 1982).|$|R
