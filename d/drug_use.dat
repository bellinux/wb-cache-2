5|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. <b>Drug</b> <b>use</b> and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

5|$|Chbosky {{took five}} years to develop and publish The Perks of Being a Wallflower, {{creating}} the characters {{and other aspects of}} the story from his own memories. The novel addresses themes permeating adolescence, including introversion, sexuality, and <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> while also making several references to other literary works, films, and pop culture in general.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam, Nixon called for a War on Drugs, pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad, and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Poly <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine. Her <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> resulted in delusions and caused her to become schizophrenic, and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people were coming to take away her drugs.|$|E
5|$|Meth {{mouth is}} very {{difficult}} to treat unless the patient stops using methamphetamine; persistent <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> makes changes in hygiene or nutrition practices unlikely. Many drug users lack access to dental treatment, and few are willing to participate in such a course of action, often because of poverty. Those who are willing to seek dental treatment often resist discussing their <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Providing dental treatment to individuals who use methamphetamine can also be dangerous, because the potential combination of local anesthetic and methamphetamine can cause serious heart problems. There is also an increased risk of serious side effects if opioid medications are used in the patient's treatment.|$|E

5|$|The record-breaking {{performance}} {{brought him}} an invite from the Berlin IAAF Golden League meet, although organising group Euromeetings condemned the move. Revelations in Chambers' autobiography Race Against Me brought further controversy {{as the book}} had in-depth accounts of his past drug abuse and claimed <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> remained rife in athletics, estimating that half the American Olympic athletes in Beijing had used illegal substances. Chambers signed a statement with UK Sport, verifying that he believed the information to be true, which brought a close to the organisation's inquiries into his <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> An IAAF investigation concluded that the book demanded no further action on their part. Olympic gold medallist and anti-drugs campaigner Ed Moses gave his support, saying that Chambers admissions provided a useful insight, but that athletes and administrators remained in denial about {{the high levels of}} doping in athletics.|$|E

5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that his novels are frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

Fourteen teenagers were interviewed: mostly males, 14 to 19 years old and low education. Marijuana was the most <b>used</b> <b>drug</b> upon the first trial. Friends, free time and "parties" favored <b>drugs</b> <b>use.</b> Teenagers also <b>used</b> <b>drugs</b> to escape from conflicts and feelings. Different intrinsic and extrinsic factors were reported as favorable to treatment adherence and dropout.
