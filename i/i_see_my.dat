I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> situation, but I will die like a man".|$|E
500|$|At 12:30 pm, Bellerophon {{cut through}} the enemy line, {{slipping}} under {{the stern of the}} Spanish 74-gun Monarca and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, Bellerophon collided with the French 74-gun Aigle, hitting Aigles port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' yards. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard Aigle sweeping Bellerophons decks with musket fire and grenades. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive epaulettes marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply [...] "It is too late now to take them off. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> situation but I will die like a man." [...] Bellerophon was now sustaining fire from Aigle and three other ships, the Spanish San Juan Nepomuceno and Bahama, and the French Swiftsure. Bellerophons main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was [...] "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

[...] Ashton's philosophy is that the backs comprise three creative forces (the scrum-half, the fly-half and the inside-centre) and four penetrative finishers (the outside- centre, the two wings and the full-back).|$|E

2500|$|The {{effects of}} jenkem {{inhalation}} last for around {{an hour and}} consist of auditory and visual hallucinations for some users. In 1995, one user told a reporter it is [...] "more potent than cannabis." [...] A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, [...] "With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life." [...] Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist in Boston who conducted {{a study on the}} effects of hydrogen sulfide gas, or [...] "sewer gas," [...] on mice, informed Salon.com that holding your breath, choking, or [...] "the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in hypoxia, a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cecily Neville as the Duchess of York is a {{principal}} character in Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of King Richard III. She is portrayed as having deep affection for her dead sons George and Edward, but is cold and unloving to Richard, to whom she refers as a [...] "false glass that grieves me when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> shame in him." [...] Because Richard is depicted as a hunchback – he suffered from scoliosis, not kyphosis – the Duchess seems to hate him for his deformity and for his difficult birth, which several characters in the play gossip about. After Richard has done away with The Princes in the Tower, his mother turns against him completely, cursing him with the damning words: [...] "Bloody thou art, Bloody will be thy end!" [...] She has been portrayed by many noted actresses, including Elinor Aickin, Eleanor Bron, Annette Crosbie (for BBC Shakespeare in 1983), Helen Haye (in Laurence Olivier's 1955 film), Anne Jeffreys, and, in the 1995 film starring Ian McKellen, Dame Maggie Smith. In this last version, her character was given several scenes belonging to Margaret of Anjou in the actual play. In the 1955 Olivier film, her role was reduced {{to little more than}} a bit part.|$|E
2500|$|Death {{is treated}} as a businesslike event in Gilbert's topsy-turvy world. Pooh-Bah calls Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, an [...] "industrious mechanic". Ko-Ko also treats his bloody office as a profession, saying, [...] "I can't consent {{to embark on a}} {{professional}} operation unless <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>my</b> way to a successful result." [...] Of course, joking about death does not originate with The Mikado. The plot conceit that Nanki-Poo may marry Yum-Yum if he agrees to die {{at the end of the}} month was used in A Wife for a Month, a 17th-century play by John Fletcher. Ko-Ko's final speech affirms that death has been, throughout the opera, a fiction, a matter of words that can be dispelled with a phrase or two: being dead and being [...] "as good as dead" [...] are equated. In a review of the original production of The Mikado, after praising the show generally, the critic noted that the show's humour nevertheless depends on [...] "unsparing exposure of human weaknesses and follies– things grave and even horrible invested with a ridiculous aspect– all the motives prompting our actions traced back to inexhaustible sources of selfishness and cowardice... Decapitation, disembowelment, immersion in boiling oil or molten lead are the eventualities upon which [...] attention (and that of the audience) is kept fixed with gruesome persistence... has unquestionably succeeded in imbuing society with his own quaint, scornful, inverted philosophy; and has thereby established a solid claim to rank amongst the foremost of those latter-day Englishmen who have exercised a distinct psychical influence upon their contemporaries." ...|$|E
