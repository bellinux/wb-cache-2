5|$|In 1833 Balzac {{released}} Eugénie Grandet, {{his first}} best-seller. The {{tale of a}} young lady who <b>inherits</b> her father's miserliness, it also became the most critically acclaimed book of his career. The writing is simple, yet the individuals (especially the bourgeois title character) are dynamic and complex.|$|E
5|$|Today {{those songs}} are {{classics}} but, at that time, {{they were considered}} cutting edge. Eventually I realized {{that most of them}} are threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it <b>inherits.</b> Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E
5|$|During {{the episode}} Jack Donaghy <b>inherits</b> Argus, Don Geiss's beloved pet peacock. Throughout the episode, Argus {{can be seen}} at Jack's office in the 30 Rock building. An actual peacock was {{featured}} here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across the face with his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in the face with feathers instead of using the peacock itself.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism <b>inherits</b> for one trait is unrelated to which allele it <b>inherits</b> for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E

It focuses on one particular chicken, Jake Gallo, who is part of the second generation of intelligent chickens. When his father dies, Jake <b>inherits</b> a diary chronicling a struggle for equal rights that spans twenty years. It was favorably compared to George Orwell's Animal Farm and received critical acclaim for its art and seriousness. It won two awards in France and was nominated for one in North America.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically <b>inherits</b> one {{copy of the}} gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E

With Wayne presumed {{killed in the}} riots, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and his {{remaining}} estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Wayne had fixed the Bat's autopilot and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished. While visiting Florence, Alfred discovers that Wayne is alive, and {{in a relationship with}} Selina Kyle. Blake resigns from the police force and, in accordance to Wayne's will, <b>inherits</b> the Batcave.|$|E

While Anora <b>inherits</b> her husband's authority, Loghain quickly {{declares}} himself her regent and effectively seizes control of the kingdom, swiftly becoming a brutal and tyrannical ruler determined to retain power. Ferelden's nobility rebel against him, igniting a civil war. Both sides battle to an inconclusive stalemate, and the darkspawn {{take advantage of the}} chaos to advance further into Ferelden unopposed.|$|E

5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of Harsha Vardhan, a young man who <b>inherits</b> a {{business}} empire from his father Ravikanth (played by Jagapati Babu). Urged by his friend Charuseela to learn about his and his father's ancestral roots in a remote village named Devarakota, Harsha adopts the village and spends some time trying to improve the standard of living of the local people and the infrastructure of the village. His efforts anger the local crime boss Sashi (played by Sampath Raj) and his brother Venkata Ratnam, a politician (played by Mukesh Rishi).|$|E
5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who <b>inherits</b> the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|The vocabulary, however, {{is mostly}} Chinese, based on Guiliu and the Tuguai variant of Pinghua. Out of the 2,000 most {{commonly}} used E words, only about 200 are of Tai-Kadai origin. E also <b>inherits</b> elements of these Chinese dialects' phonology and compound word formation. E morphology is primarily analytic, with concepts such as negation expressed with auxiliary words (pat6, m2) and no pronominal agreement.|$|E
50|$|Children of {{a parent}} who carries a CARD11 {{mutation}} have a 50% chance of <b>inheriting</b> the mutation. In a family, each child’s risk of <b>inheriting</b> the mutated CARD11 allele is independent {{of whether or not}} other siblings <b>inherited</b> the mutation. For example, if the first four children in a family have the mutation, the next child has the same 50% risk of <b>inheriting</b> the mutation. Children who do not <b>inherit</b> the mutation will not develop BENTA disease nor pass it on to their children.|$|R

5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically <b>inherits</b> the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who <b>inherits</b> the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game <b>inherits</b> issues from {{previous}} Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Growing {{evidence}} indicates that <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases are increasingly being recognised. Life expectancy for many patients is progressively improving because new therapeutic strategies are available. Because most <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases are systemic disorders, virtually all organs may be involved. Respiratory disease complicates the management of several <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases, either at presentation or as late-onset features. This review will describe the most exemplary respiratory manifestations of <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases in childhood and adulthood. Since airways disease worsens the morbidity of many <b>inherited</b> metabolic disorders, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and overall healthcare costs, respiratory manifestations of <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases need to be carefully recognised and treated. All patients with <b>inherited</b> metabolic disease and suspected airway disease should undergo a detailed diagnostic work-up. Current treatments for several <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases (including enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction, bone marrow transplantation, or even more innovative strategies such as pharmacological chaperone or gene therapies) may provide significant benefits for associated respiratory disease. The integration of several specialists dedicated to airway disease management in a multidisciplinary team is essential to provide the most appropriate care to children and adults with <b>inherited</b> metabolic disease...|$|R
