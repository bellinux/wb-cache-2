5000|$|In the 19th {{century the}} {{possibilities}} of terracotta <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> were again appreciated by architects, often using thicker pieces of terracotta, and surfaces that are not flat. [...] The American architect Louis Sullivan {{is well known for}} his elaborate glazed terracotta ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium. Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian Birmingham, England. By about 1930 the widespread use of concrete and Modernist architecture largely ended the use of terracotta in architecture.|$|E
50|$|The Temple of Proserpina or Temple of Proserpine (Tempju ta' Proserpina) was a Roman {{temple in}} Mtarfa, Malta, an area which was {{originally}} a suburb outside {{the walls of}} Melite.

The ruins of the temple were discovered in 1613, {{and most of its}} marble blocks were later used in the <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> including Auberge d'Italie and the Castellania in Valletta.

50|$|The Classical Period {{also saw}} an {{increase}} in the use of statues and sculptures as <b>decorations</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> The characteristic temples of the Classical era, such as the Parthenon in Athens, and the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, used relief sculpture for decorative friezes, and sculpture in the round to fill the triangular fields of the pediments. The difficult aesthetic and technical challenge stimulated {{much in the way of}} sculptural innovation. Most of these works survive only in fragments, for example the Parthenon Marbles, roughly half of which are in the British Museum.|$|R

50|$|It is {{somewhat}} remarkable that the Arts should be deprived {{at the same}} time of two of their greatest ornaments, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr Adam: {{and it is difficult to}} say which of them excelled most in his particular profession... Mr Adam produced a total change in the architecture of this country: and his fertile genius in elegant ornament was not confined to the <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> but has been diffused to every branch of manufacture. His talents extend beyond the lie of his own profession: he displayed in his numerous drawings in landscape a luxuriance of composition, and an effect of light and shadow, which have scarcely been equalled...to the last period of his life, Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius and refinement of taste: for in the space of one year preceding his death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty five private buildings, so various in their style, and so beautiful in their composition, that they have been allowed by the best judges, sufficient of themselves, to establish his fame unrivalled as an artist.|$|E

50|$|Early in his career, he {{advocated}} {{the idea that}} architects should have a practical involvement with the <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> their <b>buildings,</b> and painted murals at Boyne Hill church himself.

5000|$|Kircher made {{numerous}} study trips throughout Europa, Asia, North America and Egypt. During these travels, he {{made several}} important paintings, drawings and illustrations. In 1893 {{he worked on}} the picturesque <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> at the World Exhibition in Chicago as well as panoramas and dioramas of the marine painter :de:Hans von Petersen. In addition, Kircher worked as an illustrator for popular German and foreign magazines and publishers of which only a few can be mentioned: The Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung or the modern illustrated weekly Reclams universe (Leipzig), the writings of the Austrian (Vienna) and the German fleet association (Berlin) and the Viennese publisher Philipp & Kramer, for which he designed the postcard series [...] "Dalmatia and Istria". These include Feldpost, postcards which Kircher created for the Austrian Red Cross, the War Welfare Office or the War Aid Office and also for the London Postcard Publisher Raphael Tuck & Sons and the Swedish Postcards Publisher: [...] "Gothenburg Lithographic AB and Meyer & Köster" [...] etc. For some time Kircher owned a steam yacht, which he named Romana - this was his wife's name. With this ship he could better motives collect and draw maritime objects from the area. This he did for example in fleet parades.|$|E
5000|$|Paleotti was, with Molanus and Cardinal Charles Borromeo, one of {{the most}} {{influential}} writers to write filling out the brief decree of the Council on religious images with detailed instructions on their iconography. He did not become greatly interested in art until the 1570s, when he began work on his Discorso intorno alle imagine sacre et profane, consulting scholars and artists such as Prospero Fontana, Domenico Tibaldi and Pirro Ligorio. The Discorso was projected as a work in five books, but never completed. Two volumes and tables of contents for the rest were published in Italian in 1582 in what was intended as a provisional text, not properly revised. The work began with a consideration of the functions of religious and secular art, drawing on classical, biblical and patristic writings, and generally awarding a high place to the role of art and the position of the artist, always guided by the church. [...] Book II discussed specific issues of iconography in religious art. Following the council, he proscribed as sin any frivolity, indecorum, and use of traditional depictions without scriptural foundation. Unlike some clerical writers, he covered secular art, demanding Catholic standards of morality and decorum in that too, though he admitted to a correspondent that artists might be under financial pressures to produce [...] "immoral" [...] works. He rejected the excesses of Mannerism and supported naturalistic styles that were historically accurate and easy for the simple viewer to understand, and so represented [...] "silent preaching". [...] The plans for books III-V were to cover respectively secular art, saints and the Trinity in art, and the <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> with closing [...] "exhortations to the clergy, patrons and painters".|$|E
