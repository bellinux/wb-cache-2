Die Thermoschockerprobung von Zwischendiffusor-Innenringen wurde fortgesetzt. Von 4 Diffusoren versagten 3, einer ueberlebte den Schocktest. Die bruchmechanische Untersuchung eines der geschaedigten Diffusoren ergab, dass eine Bruchausgangsstelle an der Innenseite im Bereich der Randzone des Diffusor-Bodens liegt, wo nach Berechnungen Spannungen bis zu 110 MPa auftreten. Der Bruch ist nicht auf Fehlstellen im Werkstoff zurueckzufuehren. Der nach dem Thermoschock unbeschaedigte Diffusor wurde auf dem bereits frueher beschriebenen Pruefstand unter triebwerksnahen Bedingungen weiter erprobt, ein Schaden trat bisher nicht auf. Von den angelieferten gruengefraesten und nachgehipten Verdichterturbinen-Leitgittern hat eines den Thermoschock ueber 5 Stunden ohne Schaden ueberstanden. Eine weitere Erprobung auf dem triebwerksnahen Pruefstand ist nicht moeglich, da diese Leitgitter zu stark verformt sind. (orig. /AKF) The {{calculations}} for {{the optimum}} {{configuration of the}} compressor guide grid are supplemented by three variants, which were detailed in design {{in the context of}} the engine environment and taking into account manufacturing technique points of view (wall thickness). The thermal shock testing of inter-diffuser internal rings was continued. Three out of four diffusers failed, but one survived the shock test. The fracture mechanics examination of one of the damaged diffusers showed that a start of a fracture was on the inside in the area of the edge zone of the diffuser floor where, according to calculations, stresses up to 110 MPa occur. The fracture is not due to faults in the material. The diffuser not damaged by thermal shock was tested further on the test rig described previously, and up to now no damage has occurred. Of the compressor turbine <b>guide</b> <b>grids</b> supplied milled and subsequently hipped, one survived thermal shock for 5 hours without damage. Further testing on the test rig similar to an engine is not possible, as these <b>guide</b> <b>grids</b> are too greatly deformed.

In first group, implants were placed by using grid, second group (X-ray pin) and third group (wire eye). Pre- and postoperative radiographs were recorded by using radio visual graph (RVG). Planned insertion point (PIP) was marked and compared in all the three groups. Actual insertion point (AIP) was marked and compared, and the distance between AIP and nearest root of adjacent teeth was also measured. Results: Mean values of horizontal distance from GC to PIP by using <b>grid</b> <b>guide,</b> X-ray pin and wire eye was 0. 1514 ± 0. 1624, 0. 2829 ±. 1031 and 0. 379 ± 0. 069.

40|$|Introduction: Surgically {{implanted}} chambers with removable grids {{are routinely}} used for studying patterns of neuronal activity in primate brains; however, accessing target tissues is significantly constrained by standard grid designs. Typically, grids are configured {{with a series}} of guide holes drilled vertically, parallel to the walls of the chamber, thus targeted sites are limited to those in line vertically with one of the guide holes. Methods: By using the three-dimensional modeling software, a novel grid was designed to reach the targeted sites far beyond the standard reach of the chamber. The grid was fabricated using conventional machining techniques and three-dimensional printing. Results: A pilot study involving microinjection of the magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent gadolinium into the discrete regions of interest (ROIs) in the temporal cortex of an awake, behaving monkey demonstrated the effectiveness of this new design of the <b>guide</b> <b>grid.</b> Using multiple different angles of approach, we were readily able to access 10 injection sites, which were up to 5 mm outside the traditional, orthogonal reach of the chamber...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{numerical}} {{implementation and}} {{a test of}} the modified variational multiconfigurational Gaussian (vMCG) equations are presented. In vMCG, the wave function is represented as a superposition of trajectory guided Gaussian coherent states, and the time derivatives of the wave function parameters are found from a system of linear equations, which in turn follows from the variational principle applied simultaneously to all wave function parameters. In the original formulation of vMCG, the corresponding matrix was not well-behaved and needed regularization, which required matrix inversion. The new implementation of the modified vMCG equations seems to have improved the method, which now enables straightforward solution of the linear system without matrix inversion, thus achieving greater efficiency, stability and robustness. Here the new version of the vMCG approach is tested against a number of benchmarks, which previously have been studied by split-operator, multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) and multilayer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH) techniques. The accuracy and efficiency of the new implementation of vMCG is directly compared with the method of coupled coherent states (CCS), another technique that uses trajectory <b>guided</b> <b>grids.</b> More generally we demonstrate that trajectory guided Gaussian based methods are capable of simulating quantum systems with tens or even hundreds of degrees of freedom previously accessible only for MCTDH and ML-MCTDH...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} spatial {{electricity}} planning model to <b>guide</b> <b>grid</b> expansion {{in countries with}} low pre-existing electricity coverage. The model {{can be used to}} rapidly estimate connection costs and compare different regions and communities. Inputs that are modeled include electricity demand, costs, and geographic characteristics. The spatial nature of the model permits accurate representation of the existing electricity network and population distribution, which form the basis for future expansion decisions. The methodology and model assumptions are illustrated using country-specific data from Kenya. Results show that under most geographic conditions, extension of the national grid is less costly than off-grid options. Based on realistic penetration rates for Kenya, we estimate an average connection cost of $ 1900 per household, with lower-cost connection opportunities around major cities and in denser rural regions. In areas with an adequate pre-existing medium-voltage backbone, we estimate that over 30 % of households could be connected for less than $ 1000 per connection through infilling. The penetration rate, an exogenous factor chosen by electricity planners, is found to have a large effect on household connection costs, often outweighing socio-economic and spatial factors such as inter-household distance, per-household demand, and proximity to the national grid.
