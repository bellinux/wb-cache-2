5|$|Released in November 1991, Loveless was rumoured to {{have cost}} over £250,000 and {{bankrupt}} Creation Records, claims which Shields has denied. Critical reception to Loveless was almost unanimous with praise although {{the album was}} not a commercial success. It peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart but failed to chart elsewhere internationally. McGee <b>dropped</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine from Creation Records soon {{after the release of}} Loveless, due to the album's extensive recording period and interpersonal problems with Shields.|$|E
500|$|The {{win in the}} Kentucky Derby marked Secretariat's third win in {{the four}} races he had run as a three-year old. After the race, jockey Ron Turcotte stated, in {{response}} to Secretariat's last place start, he [...] "just <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hand on him and let him run his own race." [...] With Secretariat's victory, trainer Lucien Laurin had his second consecutive win in the Derby, as Riva Ridge won in 1972. Turcotte accomplished a similar feat as he had ridden Riva Ridge, marking the third time a jockey had won in the Derby in consecutive years.|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E

500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was quite clear that we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee <b>dropped</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, Byrd wrote {{a letter}} to a Grand Wizard stating, [...] "The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation." [...] However, when running for the United States House of Representatives in 1952, he {{announced}} [...] "After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan." [...] He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was anti-communist.|$|E

By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me {{into his office and}} had me drop my trousers... I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early...|$|E

2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I <b>dropped</b> <b>my</b> rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E
