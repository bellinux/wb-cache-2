5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in {{what had been a}} domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|A deployable, or delayed surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is an {{inflatable}} marker which the diver inflates while underwater and sends {{up at the}} end of a line to indicate position, and usually either that he or she is ascending, or that there is a problem. The use of a DSMB is common when divers <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> decompression stops away from a fixed reference, or will be surfacing in an area with boat traffic, or need to indicate their position to the dive boat or surface team.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the entry}} into the war was clearly {{political}} opportunism, {{which led to a}} lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard for the consequences. Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much fighting. This led to confusion amongst ordinary Italians and soldiers who had little idea of what they were fighting for and, hence, had little conviction and saw little justification for it. As the war progressed and one disaster followed another, Comando Supremo were forced to take more serious steps in their planning.|$|E

25|$|The party fielded 434 {{candidates}} in the 2014 Indian general election, in which it did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well. It recognised that its support was based primarily in urban areas and that different strategies might be required for regions such as Uttar Pradesh where caste-based politics are the norm. The party pointed out that its funding was limited {{and that there were}} too many demands for local visits from Kejriwal. The intention was to field {{candidates in}} large numbers to maximise the likelihood of recognition as a national party by the Election Commission. The outcome was that 4 AAP candidates won, all from Punjab. Consequently, AAP became a recognised state party in Punjab. The party obtained 2% of all votes cast nationwide and 414 of its candidates forfeited their deposit by failing to secure one-sixth of the vote in their constituencies. Although the party secured 32.9 per cent of the votes in Delhi, it failed to win any seats there.|$|E
500|$|Some bookmakers {{made the}} Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched.

Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ...

40|$|Data {{from the}} Panel Study of Income Dynamics {{regarding}} 648 racially and ethnically diverse children {{was used to}} examine the relationship between the amount of time 10 - 12 year old children were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> spend in household work that benefits the family and its relationship with children's prosocial behaviors, as well as children's self-reported positive self-perceptions. Children who were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> almost always <b>do</b> household work that benefits the family were found to behave more prosocially, compared to children who rarely were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such work. Boys who were almost always <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> household work that benefits the family were reported to have more responsibility behaviors, although this pattern did not hold for girls.

500|$|Plan 9 {{replaced}} Unix as Bell Labs's primary {{platform for}} operating systems research. It explored several {{changes to the}} original Unix model that facilitate the use and programming of the system, notably in distributed multi-user environments. After several years of development and internal use, Bell Labs shipped the operating system to universities in 1992. Three years later, in 1995, Plan 9 was made available for commercial parties by AT via the book publisher Harcourt Brace. With source licenses costing $350, AT targeted the embedded systems market rather than the computer market at large; Ritchie commented that the developers did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "much displacement" [...] given how established other operating systems had become.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2014, it was {{reported}} that Kestrel had fallen months behind on loan payments to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation due to financing delays. Alan spoke on the matter saying, [...] "We're obviously still very excited about the program. We've made a lot of progress on the design, what we expect to build, what we <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the FAA, but there are other frustrations. Certainly financing the project has been slower than we had hoped and expected." [...] It was also reported that the delay in financing had impacted hiring, causing the company to reduce its staff in Superior. The WEDC and Kestrel agreed upon new terms that would defer the payments until November 2014.|$|E

He wrote to his friend F.

2500|$|Australia's first wicket cost England dearly. After 32 dull minutes Bill Lawry edged {{a chance}} off Len Coldwell (1/41) which John Murray took {{just off the}} grass in a dive that tore his {{shoulder}} ligaments. Lawry was out for 8, but Murray {{had to be taken}} off the field for medical treatment and Peter Parfitt took over behind the stumps (both he and Tom Graveney, who he replaced, were reserve wicket-keepers for their county). He did a reasonable job, but took no catches and few Test teams <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well in these circumstances. Norm O'Neill had failed in the number three spot so Neil Harvey came in and was missed in the slips by Cowdrey on 2 and lofted a gentle catch off Fred Trueman to David Sheppard at extra-cover on 37. Sheppard [...] "saw it all the way into my hands - and out of them. If ever I have wanted that secret trap-door and underground route to the pavilion it was then", Brian Statham shouted [...] "Bad luck", Trueman's comments are unprintable, but are usually translated as [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and keep your hands together", Harvey hit 64 runs out of 160 in 170 minutes with only two boundaries in what Johnny Moyes thought was the worse innings of his career. He was the first victim of the Cockney off-spinner Fred Titmus (7/79) who in eight overs dismissed Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Brian Booth for 5 runs as Australia slumped from 174/1 to 212/5 {{by the end of the}} day. [...] "Most males in the Australian population knew how to hit Titmus out of the attack but the selectors kept filling the Australian XI with the minority who did not", his flighty off-spin down the leg-side shackling the batsmen. Harvey was bowled, Simpson was caught off a cut by Ken Barrington for his third Test 90 (and the sixteenth first-class 90 of the season), O'Neill was bowled when he started a drive and changed his mind and Booth prodded one to Trueman at short leg. Barry Jarman came in as a nightwatchman, but was run out for a duck first thing in the morning, overbalancing after pushing the ball to David Sheppard at forward short-leg, who threw down the stumps. Titmus continued his good work, Alan Davidson (15) was caught at short-leg hitting across the line, Richie Benaud (15) was caught and bowled and Garth McKenzie (4) was quickly lbw. Only Barry Shepherd (71 not out) hit out at the bowlers, with 8 fours and a towering six off Titmus, the last scoring stroke of the innings. Brian Statham (1/67) bowled Colin Guest in his only Test innings after a last-wicket stand of 39 and Australia were out for 319, a lead of 40 far behind what was expected or wanted. The wisdom in the press box thought Australia needed to be 150 runs ahead seeing as they would bat last.|$|E
