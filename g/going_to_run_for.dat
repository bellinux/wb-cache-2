5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing {{a political campaign}} bid {{while working as a}} news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E

25|$|On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg {{announced}} that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who takes an independent and non-partisan approach. He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, December 31, 2007, that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> president in 2008. Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run, many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of Adams, Clay became {{the leader of the}} National Republicans. In 1830, Clay began making {{preparations}} for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. Early in Jackson's presidency, many doubted that Jackson would seek a second term, and Clay, Vice President John Calhoun, and former Treasury Secretary William Crawford (whose health had somewhat improved since 1824) all began preparations for the upcoming election. In 1831, Jackson {{made it clear that he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. While the two previous elections had essentially been intra-party contests among Democratic-Republicans, the election of 1832 saw the development of discrete political parties. Jackson's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies. John C. Calhoun's Nullifier faction opposed Jackson after the president took a strong stance against nullification, but the Nullifiers and National Republicans disagreed about the tariff, limiting the possibility of cooperation. The Anti-Masonic Party, a new political party opposed to Freemasonry, nominated former Attorney William Wirt for president. Clay, himself a Freemason, considered withdrawing from the race in hopes of unifying Jackson's opponents, but he ultimately decided to stay in the race. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party's national convention, Clay's followers arranged for a national nominating convention, with the intention of anointing Clay as the National Republican nominee. Facing little opposition at the convention, Clay won the party's presidential nomination, and the convention nominated Pennsylvania Congressman John Sergeant as Clay's running mate. As the election approached, the debate over the re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States emerged as the most important issue. In his veto of the bank, Jackson effectively made the case that the bank was a tool of the elites, bolstering his popularity with the people.|$|E

Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country. However, in her 2001 book Aliyans Prava i Milosediya (The Alliance of Law and Mercy), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared [...] "patient" [...] Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly [...] "psychopathic".|$|E
50|$|When the MPRS {{turned its}} {{attention}} to the presidency, Suharto faced an obstacle {{in the form of}} MPRS Chairman General Abdul Haris Nasution. Nasution was of the opinion that Suharto should deliver an accountability speech before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> president. This notion did not gain momentum and Nasution was forced to let the matter go. On 27 March 1968, Suharto was officially elected to a full five-year term; in the process officially becoming President of Indonesia. Nasution's advice, however, would only be materialized almost {{at the end of his}} first term, when he gave such an address on the 1971 General Session of the MPR.|$|R
50|$|A peaker plant may operate {{many hours}} a day, {{or it may}} operate {{only a few hours}} per year, {{depending}} on the condition of the region's electrical grid. Because of the cost of building an efficient power plant, if a peaker plant is only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>run</b> <b>for</b> a short or highly variable time it does not make economic sense to make it as efficient as a base load power plant. In addition, the equipment and fuels used in base load plants are often unsuitable for use in peaker plants because the fluctuating conditions would severely strain the equipment. For these reasons, nuclear, geothermal, waste-to-energy, coal and biomass are rarely, if ever, operated as peaker plants.|$|R

To {{accommodate}} {{for the opening}} of Riverside High School in 2015, the boundary lines <b>for</b> Broad <b>Run</b> changed, resulting in a quarter of Farmwell students being zoned for Stone Bridge High School. This caused controversy, not only due to the intense rivalry between the two schools, but also due to many Farmwell students living closer of Broad Run, but instead now being zoned for Stone Bridge. However, to make up for this, the class of 2017 was given the choice of either attending Stone Bridge or Broad Run, and the class of 2018 was given the choice of either <b>going</b> straight <b>to</b> Stone Bridge, or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Broad <b>Run</b> <b>for</b> a year and then transferring there.

500|$|Feeling {{like her}} {{character}} was wasting her college degree O'Toole suggested to the producers that Martha {{go to work}} for Lex during the second season. The producers agreed, but altered the concept so that Martha went to work for Lionel, and that she would use this new position to spy on Lionel and find out what he knows about Clark. Disappointed when the storyline ended quickly into the second season, O'Toole hoped that the secret her character was holding in [...] "Ryan" [...] was that Martha was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> Mayor. In O'Toole's opinion, Martha needs some form of outlet for intelligence. To the chagrin of O'Toole, Martha's next storyline—the expectation of a new child—tied the character to the farm in a way the actress did not agree with. O'Toole wanted to perform as if the pregnancy was fake—something mentally created by Clark's ship—but the producers insisted that she wear the pregnancy pads to indicate that she was indeed pregnant. Ultimately, that storyline ended with Martha losing the baby to a miscarriage. Before season four began, O'Toole suggested again to the producers that Martha {{go to work for}} Lex. O'Toole had enjoyed the moments in the show when she was working for Lionel, because it gave her character something more to do, and she wanted to do that again for season four. The producers took her suggestion and had Martha take a job at the Talon, which was owned by Lex, and which O'Toole felt allowed Martha to interact more with the other characters in Clark's life.|$|E

[...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water.

It was solved in one-dimension by Ernst Ising in 1925 and in two-dimensions without an external magnetic field by Lars Onsager in 1944. In this thesis {{we look at the}} anisotropic Ising model on the Union Jack lattice. This lattice {{is one of the few}} exactly solvable models which exhibits a re-entrant phase transition and so is of great interest. Initially we cover the history of the Ising model and some possible applications outside the traditional magnetic substances. Background theory will be presented before briefly discussing the calculations for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models. After this we will focus on the Union Jack lattice and specifically the work of Wu and Lin in their 1987 paper "Ising model on the Union Jack lattice as a free fermion model. " [WL 87]. Next we will develop a mean field prediction for the Union Jack lattice after first discussing mean field theory for other lattices. Finally we will present the results of numerical simulations.
