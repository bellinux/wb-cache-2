From a scientific perspective, there is large {{interest in the}} fundamental understanding of electrical transport in organic semiconductors. However, a well-developed microscopic description is still lacking, due to the complicated character of the many-body polaronic-type of charge carriers in molecular compounds. In this Thesis, we have experimentally studied the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of organic semiconductors by using organic single-crystal field-effect transistors. The electric field-effect has been frequently used to investigate thin films of organic compounds. Unfortunately, thin-film transistors are not suitable {{for the study of}} intrinsic electronic properties of organic conductors, because their characteristics are often strongly affected by imperfections of the film structure and by insufficient purity of organic materials. Thus, for a higher degree of molecular ordering and an improved quality of the FET, we fabricate devices on the surface of a free-standing single crystal of organic molecules. In short, in this work we have achieved successful fabrication of high-quality single-crystal FETs, exhibiting high mobilities and signs of intrinsic transport. Herewith, we have identified new aspects that influence <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> in organic semiconductor FETs, and we have performed exploratory measurements in the charge density regime approaching one carrier per molecule.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} a technique {{based on the}} grazing incidence crystal truncation rod (GI-CTR) X-ray diffraction method used to solve the crystal structure of substrate induced fiber structured organic thin films. The crystal structures of pentacene thin films grown on technologically relevant gate dielectric substrates are reported. It is widely recognized, that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) depend strongly on the crystal structure of the organic semiconductor layer. Pentacene, showing {{one of the highest}} charge carrier mobilities among organic semiconductors, is known to crystallize in at least four polymorphs, which can be distinguished by their layer periodicity d(001). Only two polymorphs (14. 4 Å and 14. 1 Å), grow as single crystals and their detailed crystal structure has been solved with standard crystallography techniques. The substrate induced 15. 4 Å polymorph, the so called pentacene thin-film phase, is the most relevant for OTFT applications, since it grows at room temperature on technologically relevant gate dielectrics. However, the crystal structure of the pentacene thin-film phase has remained incomplete as it only grows as a fiber structured thin film. In this thesis, the GI-CTR X-ray diffraction technique is extended to fiber structured thin films. The X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the synchrotron source beamline W 1 at HASYLAB in Hamburg, in order to obtain enough diffraction data for the determination of the crystal structure as pentacene thin films only grow as ultra thin films with crystal grains as small as 0. 4 μm. Pentacene thin films are also known to be sensitive to environmental conditions, such as light and oxygen. For this reason, the X-ray synchrotron measurements were performed in-situ. A portable ultra high vacuum growth chamber equipped with a rotatable sample holder and a beryllium window was built in order to perform X-ray measurements of up to four samples right after the thin film growth process without breaking the vacuum. Parallel to this, a versatile software package coded with Matlab in order to simulate, analyze and fit the complex data measured at the synchrotron source was developed. The complete crystal structure of the 15. 4 Å pentacene thin-film polymorph grown on four model types of gate dielectric materials, amorphous silicon dioxide (a−SiO 2), octadecyltrichlorosilane-treated a−SiO 2 (OTS), Topas (“thermoplastic olefin polymer of amorphous structure”) and polystyrene films, was solved. It was found, that the unit cell parameters are identical within measurement precision on all measured substrates. The crystal structure belongs to the space group P- 1 and was found to be triclinic with the following lattice parameters: a = 5. 958 ± 0. 005 Å, b = 7. 596 ± 0. 008 Å, c = 15. 61 ± 0. 01 Å, alpha = 81. 25 ± 0. 04 °, beta = 86. 56 ± 0. 04 ° and 2 gamma = 89. 80 ± 0. 10 °. The unit cell volume V = 697 Å^ 3 is the largest of all pentacene polymorphs reported so far. However, the molecular arrangement within the unit cell was found to be substrate dependent. Here, the following parameters are reported: The herringbone angle is 54. 3 °, 55. 8 °, 59. 4 ° and 55. 1 ° for a−SiO 2, OTS, Topas and polystyrene, respectively. The tilts of the two molecular axes (theta_A, theta_B) are (5. 6 °, 6. 0 °), (6. 4 °, 6. 8 °), (5. 6 °, 6. 3 °) and (5. 7 °, 6. 0 °) for a−SiO 2, OTS, Topas and polystyrene, respectively. To conclude, it was shown that the molecular orientation in the unit cell differs among substrates while the unit cell dimensions of the 15. 4 Å pentacene polymorph are identical. This indicates that substrate effects have to be included if one aims on understanding the molecular structure of the thin-film phase in detail. The crystal structures reported here provide a basis to apply techniques such as density functional methods to investigate <b>intrinsic</b> <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> and optical properties of organic thin film devices on a molecular level. In previous studies it was observed that different substrates vary the charge carrier mobility in OTFTs. The substrate dependent crystal structures observed here could be one reason for this variation. This topic may lead ultimatively to a controlled finetuning of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> The experimental approach to determine the crystal structure developed here can be easily applied {{to a wide range of}} organic thin film systems used in organic electronic devices...|$|R

For graphene, having mobility up to 16, 000 cm^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1, we measure almost constant spin-signals both in electron and hole-doped regimes, independent of the conducting state of the underlying WS_ 2 substrate, which rules out the role of spin-absorption by WS_ 2. The spin-relaxation time τ_s for the electrons in graphene-on-WS_ 2 is drastically reduced down to 10 ps than τ_s 800 ps in graphene-on-SiO_ 2 on the same chip. The strong suppression of τ_s along with a detectable weak anti-localization signature in the quantum magneto-resistance measurements is a clear effect of the WS_ 2 induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene. Via the top-gate voltage application in the encapsulated region, we modulate the electric field by 1 V/nm, changing τ_s almost {{by a factor of}} four which suggests the electric-field control of the in-plane Rashba SOC. Further, via carrier-density dependence of τ_s we also identify the fingerprints of the D'yakonov-Perel' type mechanism in the hole-doped regime at the graphene-WS_ 2 interface.

Organic semiconductors {{are based on}} π-conjugated molecules, either small molecules or macromolecules such as dendrimers or polymers. <b>Charge</b> <b>transport</b> through organic materials {{is one of the}} most important processes that drive organic electronic devices. We have investigated the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> in various molecular designs based on dendrons, dendron-rod-coil molecular triads, and conjugated oligomers. The <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> were studied using bottom contact field effect transistors, in which the material was deposited by spin coating. In case of dendrons, their generation and density of <b>charge</b> <b>transporting</b> functionalities were found to play a significant role in influencing the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> ^ In case of macromolecules such as dendron-rod-coil molecules, the solid state morphology plays a significant role in influencing the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> While these molecules exhibit only electron transporting behavior in field-effect transistor measurements, ambipolar <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> is observed in the diode configuration. ^ Short conjugated oligomers, based on donor-acceptor-donor design, provide model systems for conjugated polymers. Effect of varying the donor functionality on optoelectronic and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> was studied in short donor-acceptor-donor molecules. While donor-acceptor-donor molecules are well known in the literature, the effect of molecular composition on the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> is not well understood. We designed molecules with 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole as the acceptor and thiophene based donor functionalities. These molecules exhibit a reduced bandgap, good solution processability and charge mobility making them interesting systems for application in organic photovoltaics. ^ Cyclopentadithiophene (CPD) based materials have been widely utilized as organic semiconductors due to their planar nature which favors intermolecular <b>charge</b> <b>transport.</b> While most CPD based materials are hole transporting, incorporation of electron withdrawing fluorinated substituents imparts n-type behavior to these molecules. This change in <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> has often been attributed to the lowering of the LUMO energy level due to the increased electron affinity in the molecule. We designed CPD based semiconductors in which the bridgehead position was functionalized with electron withdrawing ketone or dicyanomethylene group and the -positions were substituted with phenyl or pentafluorophenyl groups. Both the phenyl substituted molecules are p-type materials, even though the dicyanomethylene group lowers the LUMO by 500 meV as compared to the carbonyl compound. The pentafluorophenyl substituted molecules are n-type materials even as their LUMO energy levels are about 300 meV higher than the corresponding phenyl substituted molecules. This indicates that <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> behavior is not an exclusive function of the frontier orbital energy levels. ...|$|R

In the recent past, many literature reports {{have suggested that the}} side chains {{play a critical role in}} molecular packing and strongly impact the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of conjugated polymers. In this work, we have investigated the influence of side-chains on the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> behavior of a novel class of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based alternating copolymers. To investigate the role of side-chains, we prepared four diketopyrrolopyrrole-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP-DPP) conjugated polymers with varied side-chains and carried out a systematic study of thin film microstructure and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> in polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs). Combining results obtained from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> in PTFTs, we conclude side-chains have a strong influence on molecular packing, thin film microstructure, and the charge carrier mobility of DPP-DPP copolymers. However, the influence of side-chains on optical properties was moderate. The preferential "edge-on" packing and dominant n-channel behavior with exceptionally high field-effect electron mobility values of > 1 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1) were observed by incorporating hydrophilic (triethylene glycol) and hydrophobic side-chains of alternate DPP units. In contrast moderate electron and hole mobilities were observed by incorporation of branched hydrophobic side-chains. This work clearly demonstrates that the subtle balance between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity induced by side-chains is a powerful strategy to alter the molecular packing and improve the ambipolar <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> in DPP-DPP based conjugated polymers. Theoretical analysis supports the conclusion that the side-chains influence polymer properties through morphology changes, as there is no effect on the electronic properties in the gas phase.

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} diketopyrrolopyrrole-based small {{molecules}} {{have been designed}} to explore their optical, electronic, and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> as organic solar cell (OSCs) materials. The calculation results showed that the designed molecules can lower the band gap and extend the absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths. The designed molecules own the large longest wavelength of absorption spectra, the oscillator strength, and absorption region values. The optical, electronic, and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of the designed molecules are affected by the introduction of different π-bridges and end groups. We have also predicted the mobility of the designed molecule with the lowest total energies. Our results reveal that the designed molecules are expected to be promising candidates for OSC materials. Additionally, the designed molecules are expected to be promising candidates for electron and/or hole transport materials. On the basis of our results, we suggest that molecules under investigation are suitable donors for [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and its derivatives as acceptors of OSCs...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, zinc oxide has {{attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} as an important material in various electrical, chemical, and optical applications. In the present work results are discussed gained from investigations of highly porous electrochemically deposited zinc oxide, which is a promising electrode material both in the area of solar energy conversion and sensor technology. The films were prepared by adding detergents during the electrodeposition process. The detergents have a structure-directing influence during the film deposition and, therefore, on the morphology of the films. The obtained electrodes can easily be sensitized for light or different chemicals by a simple adsorption of different molecules. In the present work I discuss the fundamental <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of electrochemically deposited zinc oxide films. Temperature-dependent measurements of the current-voltage characteristics are carried out and the spectral response of the photoconductivity is investigated. In order to understand the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of this highly porous material, it is necessary to get a deeper insight in the electrod...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{alternating}} electron-donating and electron-acceptor (D-A) conjugated copolymers {{are among}} the best materials being used to fabricate high-efficiency bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ-OPVs). Thiophene and thiophene-based aromatic molecules are typically used in the design and construction of these materials due to their ability to impart good film-forming and <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> as well as their synthetic robustness. Among thiophene-based molecules benzo[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b 2 ̆ 7]dithiophene (BDT) has been incorporated into numerous, high-efficiency OPVs. This dissertation reports on the synthesis and characterization of the analogous oxygen- and selenium-containing functionalized benzodifuran (BDF) and benzodiselenophene (BDSe) and their incorporation into conjugated polymers as donor materials in BHJ-PVCs. Substitution of alternative chalcogens within the polymer backbone offers the potential for broader absorption of the solar spectrum, more favorable energy levels, and better <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> Additionally, the synthesis of the benzodichalcogenophenes (BDCs) reported herein results in synthetic handles, allowing for further functionalization {{that can be used to}} tune the properties of the subsequent polymers...|$|R
40|$|The structures, {{optical and}} {{electrical}} <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of SnO_ 2 films, fabricated by rf sputtering method at different oxygen partial pressures, were systematically investigated. It {{has been found}} that preferred growth orientation of SnO_ 2 film is strongly related to the oxygen partial pressure during deposition, which provides an effective way to tune the surface texture of SnO_ 2 film. All films reveal relatively high transparency in the visible range, and both the transmittance and optical band gap increase with increasing oxygen partial pressure. The temperature dependence of resisitivities was measured from 380 K down to liquid helium temperatures. At temperature above ∼ 80 K, besides the nearest-neighbor-hopping process, thermal activation processes related to two donor levels (∼ 30 and ∼ 100 meV below the conduction band minimum) of oxygen vacancies are responsible for the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> Below ∼ 80 K, Mott variable-range-hopping conduction process governs the <b>charge</b> <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> at higher temperatures, while Efros-Shklovskii variable-range-hopping conduction process dominates the <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> at lower temperatures. Distinct crossover from Mott type to Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range-hopping conduction process at several to a few tens kelvin are observed for all SnO_ 2 films.

The insulating devices demonstrated single-charge tunneling and resonant tunneling at mK temperatures. A magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate could suppress the Coulomb oscillations, suggesting that the charge interactions were due to dynamical charge inhomogeneities, rather than single-nanoparticle charging effects...|$|R

We find that photoluminescence quenching is insensitive to blend composition but the photovoltaic quantum yield is strongly composition dependent. This indicates that <b>charge</b> <b>transport,</b> and not <b>charge</b> generation, is the factor limiting device performance.
