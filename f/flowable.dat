The strength of <b>flowable</b> fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. <b>Flowable</b> fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix <b>flowable.</b> Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E

50|$|CLSM as {{a highway}} {{construction}} material {{is becoming more}} widespread throughout the United States. Data received from questionnaires sent by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) in 1991 and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in 1992 indicated that approximately 30 states had some experience {{with the use of}} <b>flowable</b> fill, and at least 24 states have a specification for <b>flowable</b> fill.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most states}} have {{somewhat}} limited experience to date with <b>flowable</b> fill, nearly all {{states that have}} used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance {{with little or no}} problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance {{to the use of the}} material by contractors or engineers. Since <b>flowable</b> fill is normally a comparatively low-strength material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in <b>flowable</b> fill or controlled low strength material mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in <b>flowable</b> fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix flowability. Its relatively low dry unit weight (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.|$|E

50|$|The {{defects in}} {{concrete}} in Japan {{were found to}} be mainly due to high water-cement ratio to increase workability. Poor compaction occurred mostly because of the need for speedy construction in the 1960s and 1970s. Hajime Okamura envisioned the need for concrete which is highly workable and does not rely on the mechanical force for compaction. During the 1980s, Okamura and his Ph.D. student Kazamasa Ozawa at the University of Tokyo developed self-compacting concrete (SCC) which was cohesive, but <b>flowable</b> and took the shape of the formwork without use of any mechanical compaction. SCC is known as self-consolidating concrete in the United States.|$|E
