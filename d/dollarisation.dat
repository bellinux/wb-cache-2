50|$|In {{situations}} of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency {{for the local}} currency. The U.S. dollar {{is viewed as a}} relatively stable and safe currency and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent of all U.S. currency, was believed to be circulating abroad. The most recent study of the amount of currency held overseas suggests that only 25 percent of U.S. currency is presently held abroad. The widespread substitution of U.S. currency for local currency is known as de facto <b>dollarisation,</b> and has been observed in transition countries such as Cambodia and in some Latin American countries. Some countries, such as Ecuador, abandoned their local currency and now use US dollars, essentially for this reason, a process known as de jure dollarization.

Ecuador underwent currency substitution to deal with a widespread political and financial crisis resulting from massive loss of confidence in its political and monetary institutions. By contrast, El Salvador's official currency substitution was a result of internal debates and in a context of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and long-standing unofficial currency substitution. The eurozone adopted the euro (€) as its common currency and sole legal tender in 1999, which might be considered a variety of full-commitment regime similar to full currency substitution despite some evident differences from other currency substitutions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the dynamics of <b>dollarisation</b> and euroisation for 25 transition countries. Estimates {{of the amount of}} foreign currency in circulation (FCC) in transition countries are used to develop a new comprehensive <b>dollarisation</b> index (CDI) and separate indices of currency substitution (CSI) and asset substitution. When the CDI is compared to the traditional <b>dollarisation</b> index that relies solely on foreign currency deposits as a proxy for the extent of <b>dollarisation,</b> I find that the comprehensive <b>dollarisation</b> measure provides a more complete picture of the extent of de facto <b>dollarisation</b> and euroisation, and that it better reflects the separate influences of currency substitution and asset substitution. I find that the dynamic evolution of currency substitution and asset substitution in transition countries is both more variable and complex than is usually believed to be the case. These new <b>dollarisation</b> indicators enable researchers to examine the causes of the <b>dollarisation</b> process and its tendency to lead to irreversibility (hysteresis). Moreover, the currency substitution and asset substitution indices shed light on the dynamic consequences of these processes for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Finally, the new estimates of FCC make possible the measurement of effective currency/deposit ratios {{that can be used to}} develop new estimates of the size and growth of underground economies in transition countries.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>dollarisation</b> in the {{dynamics}} of inflation in Turkey. Descriptive analysis suggests that, in addition to high inflation and economic instability, institutional factors also {{played an important role}} in the evolution of <b>dollarisation</b> in Turkey. The empirical findings corroborate the importance of <b>dollarisation</b> in the dynamics of inflation. The results suggest that shocks to <b>dollarisation</b> initially lead to a decline in the monetary base as the public switches from domestic to foreign money holdings. However, the monetary base increases later on to generate the required inflation tax for a given budget deficit. The findings also indicate that the fiscal authority tries to compensate part of the decline in inflation tax through raising administered prices. As expected, the exchange rate responds positively to shocks to <b>dollarisation</b> owing to the high elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign currency.

40|$|Following {{the massive}} {{economic}} policy restructuring and reforms {{since the early}} 1980 s, currency substitution, asset substitution and de facto <b>dollarisation</b> have become common phenomena in nearly all transition and developing economies. High and persistent inflation which have been a perennial feature of developing and transition economies is now known to be highly responsible for currency substitution, asset substitution and de facto <b>dollarisation.</b> This paper presents evidence on the macrodynamics of de facto <b>dollarisation,</b> currency substitution and asset substitution during {{the era of the}} implementation of the Financial Sector Adjustment Programmes (FINSAPs) in developing and transition economies with special reference to Ghana. The study has found out that de facto <b>dollarisation</b> whether in the form of asset substitution or currency substitution is highly prevalent and poses a serious threat to fiscal and monetary policies effectiveness in developing and transition economies. In Ghana, the principal long-run mainspring of de facto <b>dollarisation</b> is the ad hoc implementation of financial sector development programme that was embarked upon about two decades ago which has resulted in high exchange rate depreciation and price fluctuations. It is, however, likely that as the financial sector develops over a long period a time will come when further development of the financial sector would no longer instigate de facto <b>dollarisation.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Persistent high {{inflation}} in Peru during the 1970 s led households to hold foreign currency as store of value. This process of <b>dollarisation</b> increased significantly during the hyperinflation of 1988 - 90.

But despite nearly a decade of subsequent economic stabilisation, the decrease in <b>dollarisation</b> has been slow: by June 1999 two thirds of domestic banking deposits were still denominated in dollars, only ten percentage points below their level in 1991. How has <b>dollarisation</b> affected the efficacy of monetary policy in Peru? In theory, under <b>dollarisation,</b> revisions in expectations of devaluation can lead to instability of the domestic money demand, making monetary control more difficult.

40|$|This paper reviews {{evidence}} of <b>dollarisation</b> in Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries, and finds {{that it is}} still very high, the well-known hysteresis effect. However high <b>dollarisation</b> – defined as the use of any foreign currency – is not only due to inertial lack of confidence. There is also some tentative evidence that suggests foreign currency is used – in both cash and deposit form – as {{one of the very few}} alternative instruments for portfolio diversification in an embryonic financial market. It is also shown that, contrary to the received wisdom, high <b>dollarisation</b> does not seriously impede effective conduct of monetary policy: money demand in FSU countries is stabilising, and the most important objective, meaningful inflation control, has been widely achieved. Thus, high <b>dollarisation</b> is not per se as damaging as often thought, and in fact has a beneficial dimension in promoting financial market development. Nonetheless, high <b>dollarisation</b> remains a concern since it provides mechanisms for magnifying vulnerabilities in the event of a crisis even if it might not be the direct cause of a crisis. This necessarily implies that some policy options (such as immediate exchange rate devaluation) are not viable or very costly in a crisis.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} financial fragilities of Turkish {{corporate sector}} to exogenous financial risks stemming mainly from global imbalances, the realisation {{of which may}} lead to substantial increases in international interest rates and/or a sudden stop or reversal of capital flows especially to developing countries, by using the CBRT Risk Center and CBRT Company Accounts firm level data over the 1996 - 2005 period. The magnitude of the impacts of real exchange rate depreciations or interest rate increases crucially depends on the financial conditions, debt structures and intersectoral fragility linkages of the main sectors of an economy. In the presence of financial fragilities including a substantial liability <b>dollarisation,</b> real exchange rate depreciations may be contractionary. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that, in spite of improvements in the leverage ratios and interest risks after the 2001 crisis, liability <b>dollarisation</b> and short maturity structure of debt still appear to be the main sources of fragility in Turkish corporate sector against exogenous financial shocks.

The positive and recently improving correlations of liability <b>dollarisation</b> with both firm size and export ratios may be limiting the risks when we consider the issues of ability to access to financial markets and debt-revenue currency composition consistency. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} extent to which the {{financial}} linkages of Latin American banks with the exterior are influenced by political risk and deposit <b>dollarisation.</b> We find that the sum of banks 2 ̆ 019 foreign assets and liabilities is a function of risk-return considerations and excess domestic credit demand. An increase in political risk is shown to be associated with a build-up of foreign positions by the banking sector, but this adverse effect on the banking system is mitigated in economies with a high share of dollarised deposits. These relationships largely hold when the determinants of foreign assets and liabilities are estimated separately, with risk-induced capital flight being moderated by a high degree of deposit <b>dollarisation.</b> While changes in overall country risk including the risk of macro collapse drive official capital outflows, for a wider measure of capital flight including informal flows only changes in political risk matter.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that money substitutes - whether in the form of foreign currency or of more exotic instruments such as privately-issued moneys - are common in developing and transition countries, and have important consequences for macroeconomic and financial sector policy. The aim of this thesis is to advance our theoretical and empirical understanding of the determinants of money substitution in developing and transition economies. We begin in Chapter 1 by addressing the need for a general theoretical framework for the analysis of money substitutes. Reviewing both the classical and the modern theoretical literature on money, we conclude that the Credit theory of money - an ancient but until recently neglected theory which conceives of money as a unilateral financial contract between its issuer and its bearer - is a useful framework for such analysis. In Chapter 2, we undertake an empirical analysis of non-cash settlements (NCS) in Croatia. Using time series econometric analysis, we demonstrate that the instruments used to settle NCS are at least in part substitutes for the national currency, created endogenously by the enterprise sector in response to constraints on their participation in the official monetary and banking system. We turn to the most important form of money substitute in developing and transition countries - foreign currency - in Chapter 3, where we present a new review of the theoretical and empirical literature on <b>dollarisation.</b> In particular, we track the evolution of theoretical models of <b>dollarisation</b> in response to the increasing empirical importance of financial <b>dollarisation</b> relative to currency substitution. In Chapter 4 we undertake an empirical study of the determinants of deposit <b>dollarisation</b> in the two transition economies of Estonia and Lithuania by building and interpreting dynamic, multiple equation, econometric models. We find that a simple, portfolio theoretic account of the <b>dollarisation</b> process furnishes a good explanation, but also that data availability limits the level of analytical detail that this approach can attain. </p...|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>dollarisation</b> on economic growth in Zimbabwe from Q 1 : 2000 to Q 4 : 2014. The variables included are gross domestic product per capita (GDPP), interest rates (lending), trade openness, gross domestic investment and <b>dollarisation.</b> The study did not, however, include inflation data because it produced spurious results {{due to the nature}} of data and some missing figures during the economic crisis. The study adopted an Auto Regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedure and the results showed that <b>dollarisation,</b> interest rates, lagged GDPP and trade openness were significant at 1 % level whilst gross domestic investment was found to be weakly significant. All results met expectations except for lagged GDPP. <b>Dollarisation</b> and trade openness significantly positively influenced economic activity at 1 % level and gross domestic investment was found to be positive but weakly significant at 10 % level for the period under consideration. Interest rates negatively influenced economic growth at 1 % level of significance. The paper recommends that the dollarization stance should be maintained due to its positive impact on economic activity. This is because dollarization resulted in economic stability and improved financial sector credibility and it is still premature to de-dollarise the economy until a sufficient level of credibility is gained by the central bank. The current liquidity constraints can be addressed by engaging respective central banks of anchor countries especially the Federal Reserve for a formal and systematic financial injection although this comes at a cost of losing national sovereignty. Zimbabwean policy makers should also establish additional complementary policies which foster economic integration with anchor countries and reduce credit risk (reflected by highly significant negative interest rates).
