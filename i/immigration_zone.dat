50|$|Sometimes border {{controls}} exist on internal borders within a sovereign state. For example, in the People's Republic of China, there are {{border controls}} at the borders among {{the mainland and}} the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. All persons need to present their passports or other types of travel documents to cross the border. For example, Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card and Home Return Permit are required for Hong Kong Permanent Residents who are Chinese citizens to cross the border. Another example is the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, each having separate border controls {{from the rest of}} Malaysia. Also Norway exercise passport check when travelling between mainland Norway and the archipelago of Svalbard which is non-Schengen area. Travelling between Guam {{and the rest of the}} United States is also such an example, since Guam is not defined to be part of the United States <b>immigration</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In other cases, visa runs may {{be tolerated}} in practice. For instance, between Malaysia and Singapore, {{as there are}} many cross-boundary {{businesses}} and many citizens of each country residing {{on the other side}} of the border. Also, foreigners residing in Singapore or Thailand who require visas to enter Malaysia are granted multiple entry visas, and are able to engage in visa runs without any disciplinary actions being taken against them. Another case is between the various <b>immigration</b> <b>zones</b> of the People's Republic of China, namely Hong Kong, Macau, and Mainland China. In order to maintain Permanent Residence in Hong Kong or Macau, individuals residing in the Mainland often travel back and forth. Similarly, individuals from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as foreigners residing there, may engage in visa runs between the two with little scrutiny from immigration officers.|$|R
30|$|The maps {{indicate}} {{that there has been}} an increasing concentration of African migrant populations in particular countries or clusters of countries. The overall pattern has been coast-bound migration from more marginal inland countries and areas. Post-independence migration has been increasingly about urbanisation and the concomitant transfer of population from inland, marginal rural areas to fertile agricultural areas, towns and cities which are often located in coastal areas. These patterns do not only exist between countries (such as between Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire) but also within countries (such as north–south migration within West African countries or south–north migration in Egypt). While Coastal West Africa and Southern Africa are larger, historically well-established <b>immigration</b> <b>zones,</b> the migration hubs in Djibouti and the oil economies of Gabon (from West and Central Africa) and Libya (from neighbouring countries) have more recently risen as major African migration destinations. The number of countries, however, with high immigration intensity has decreased over time, which reflects a general trend of decreasing intra-African migration.|$|R

5000|$|The {{prohibitions}} of Chinese and Japanese immigration were consolidated and {{the exclusion}} was expanded to Asia {{as a whole}} in the Asiatic Barred Zone Act of 1917, which prohibited all <b>immigration</b> from a <b>zone</b> that encompassed the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia (then-British India), and Southeast Asia. The Immigration Act of 1924 introduced national origin quotas for the entire Eastern Hemisphere, and barred the immigration of [...] "aliens ineligible for citizenship." [...] This introduced a period of near complete exclusion of Asian immigration to the United States. There were some key exceptions to this broad exclusion: in addition to continuing Filipino immigration due to their status as US nationals until 1934, Asian immigrants continued to immigrate to Hawaii, which was a US territory and therefore {{not subject to the}} same immigration laws until it achieved statehood in 1959. Many Chinese had also immigrated to Puerto Rico after 1882, which would become a US territory in 1898 and remains one today.|$|R
40|$|Migrations {{play a very}} {{important}} and significant cultural and historical role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have as a consequence brought economic and demographic changes and negative migration balance has been the main characteristic {{for a long period}} of time. Beside strong migration flows from Bosnian territory, internal population movements have also been very intensive, contributing to regional differences in population growth and leading to the development of <b>immigration</b> and emigration <b>zones.</b> At the same time, rural settlements have been registering a decline in population (some even ceasing to exist) while municipal centers have increased in size. To make matters worse, population reproduction has become questionable. The number of municipalities with decreased population has grown by about 13 percent during 1953 – 1991 period. Between censuses in 1981 and 1991, the number of municipalities characterized by immigration declined whereas the number of those with emigration characteristics increased. Furthermore, as a result of war and related problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1991 to 1999, only 24 municipalities now contain more inhabitants than they had in 1991. Also, the relationship between domiciled and displaced populations in municipalities is different, a fact which depends particularly on the administrative organization within the country...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} SES on student achievement {{using data from the}} Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth (LSAY), a national program of research on the transitions young people make from school. LSAY encompasses data from earlier Australian longitudinal studies—Youth in Transition (YIT; 1978 - 2002), the Australian Longitudinal Survey (ALS; 1984 - 1987), and the Australian Youth Surveys (AYS; 1989 - 1997) —and earlier studies of student achievement—Australian Studies in School Performance (1975 ASSP), the Australian Studies in Student Performance (1980 ASSP). At present, there are two active cohorts: those who were in Grade 9 in 1995 (1995 LSAY) and those who were in Grade 9 in 1998 (1998 LSAY). A new cohort will be added in 2003, based on participants in the OECD’s Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA). All of the studies included in the LSAY program begin with extensive questionnaires that collect student background information, such as parents’ occupations, home language spoken, and student’s and parents’ birthplaces, in addition to the achievement tests administered. Only 14 -year-old students were included in the present analysis. It is also important to recognise other changes in the educational and social landscape during the period in question. Between 1975 and 2002, the proportion of students attending non-government schools rose from less than 21. 2 percent to 31. 6 per cent, and the apparent retention rate increased from 34. 1 to 75. 1. 1 State governments expanded their provision of selective high schools, particularly New South Wales, the most populous state, and relaxed restrictions on local school <b>zones.</b> <b>Immigration</b> increased from countries where English is not the main language spoken, especially from Asian countries after 1975. The socioeconomic map of the major metropolitan areas also changed, with some suburbs becoming more exclusive because of housing affordability and others becoming less desirable...|$|R
40|$|In hybrid zones genetically {{differentiated}} populations {{meet and}} interbreed. As they result from ongoing divergence and potential speciation, such zones provide opportunities {{to study how}} different factors affect this process. The hybrid zone between the all black carrion crow (Corvus corone corone) and the grey and black hooded crow (Corvus c. cornix) stretches c. 2400 km throughout Europe. I have studied the German-Danish part of this hybrid zone. Hybrids zones are often maintained by a balance between <b>immigration</b> into the <b>zone</b> and selection against hybrids. The latter requires {{that some kind of}} cost is associated with hybridization, for example that hybrids suffer from reduced fertility or viability. In that case selection will favor individuals that choose partners of their own type. I found that hooded and carrion crows mated assortatively with respect to subspecies. However, no evidence of hybrid unfitness has been found in the crow hybrid zone. Another possible explanation for the observed mating pattern could be that the two subspecies are spatially separated because of phenotypic specific habitat preferences. I found no indications of that. Carrion, hooded and hybrids preferred the same habitat and this habitat was the most common in my study area. Sexual imprinting, i. e. the process whereby young individuals learn species-specific characteristics that enables them to choose appropriate mates as adults, is a mechanism that has the potential to cause assortative mating without demanding selection against hybridization. We mimicked this process by training artificial neural networks to separate their own type from the other two with hybrids as the third phenotype. The network learned pure phenotypes faster and better than the hybrid patterns showing that already at the receptor level there may be signal reception properties that will cause assortative mating. In another simulation we used partner choice preferences extracted from the neural network simulations and showed that they could maintain a hybrid zone resembling the crow hybrid zone. Under this scenario gene flow between the hybridizing populations is likely to be high because heterotypic pairings will produce as many viable and fertile offspring as homotypic pairings. This is supported by an analysis in which we analyzed 18 microsatellite loci and found no evidence for genetic differences between hooded, hybrids and carrion phenotypes sampled within the zone. We also found that the gene MC 1 R, known to be associated with melanic patterning in other organisms, could not explain the colour pattern in crows...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) It {{is within}} the perception, the reality and the {{problematic}} of international air travel that this thesis is situated. It argues that a space has been created for international air travel, which is conceptually and physically demarcated from normative social space, the Transit Zone. The thesis examines four sites constituting the Transit Zone using both political and social theory and the analysis of performance and visual artworks that explore, explain or contest aspects of the sites. The first site {{is concerned with the}} construction of nation-state territory, population and legal movement. Its physical expression {{can be found at the}} border between the Transit Zone and the nation-state. However, its conceptual reach is much more extensive, appearing in immigration policy, national law, international covenants, data-sharing practices and the creation of a space external to, yet within, the nation-state system. This site creates the Transit Zone’s paradoxical position of being excluded from nation-state territory while simultaneously defining it. The second site is premised on the (in) security of civil aviation and explores the striving towards absolute security, and the unachievability of that goal. This is a reflection of the prevalence of (in) security discourses in contemporary society. The third site is created by corporate interest within the airport terminal and the aeroplane. It is the site of logistics and sales, of the passenger functioning both as an object or unit of movement and as a desiring purchasing subject. The fourth site is constructed through the imagination – it is made up of the ideas, cultural dreams and responses that have accreted around the site of the Transit Zone. These intimate and personal responses transform the Transit Zone from a site of function, profit and government control to a vehicle for the construction and realisation of fears, fantasies and rites of passage. This thesis demonstrates that many contemporary issues infuse and surround the Transit <b>Zone.</b> <b>Immigration,</b> national defence, international politics, logistics, social interaction and cultural fantasy all collide there. It explores the complexity of the Transit Zone’s paradoxical collection of sites and systems, which can not be reduced to one single reading. The Transit Zone has evolved, and continues to do so, in response to government and international demands, legal problems, technological advancements, logistical and commercial needs, and social changes. In doing so, its evolution redefines and articulates contemporary concerns. Additionally the thesis reveals an extensive artistic engagement with the Transit Zone and the contemporary concerns it articulates. Art is used as a designated imaginative space that challenges the established reality and the art works discussed change our understanding of the Transit Zone...|$|R
40|$|Research on plant {{community}} assembly often focuses on single life stages, or transitions between two life stages, and rarely integrates multiple life stage transitions {{into a more}} complete picture of the community assembly process. This is unfortunate because it limits our ability to assess the relative influence of each life stage transition on community assembly outcomes, and hence, predict community response to perturbations such as climate change. In this dissertation, I use observational and experimental evidence {{at different points in}} the plant life cycle to improve short- and long-term predictions of community response to climate change. I work in twelve grassland sites in southern Norway that fall along orthogonal gradients of temperature and precipitation, allowing me to disentangle the influence of these climate drivers. I first combine seed, seedling, and adult plant survey data at the twelve sites to infer regional patterns of seed dispersal and <b>immigration</b> among climate <b>zones.</b> On average, 5 to 10 percent of seeds at a site putatively originated from different climates, suggesting significant connectivity among climate zones. However, immigrant seedlings were less likely to emerge and establish in experimental gaps than seedlings with locally-present conspecific adults, suggesting that a climate-based filters are in part responsible for maintaining regional vegetation patterns at the seedling stage. Despite the evidence for site connectivity, 66 of the 163 species in our system were not observed as immigrants at any point in the study, highlighting the potential for dispersal to limit species ability to track rapid changes in climate. Second, I examine changes in species diversity and community-weighted mean trait values over plant life stages to characterize the strength and nature of ecological filtering at each life stage transition. Each surveyed life stage had fewer species than expected by chance, indicating that species sorting processes restricted community membership at multiple points of {{plant community}} regeneration. Furthermore, shifts in community weighted trait means suggest that different life stage transitions are influenced by qualitatively different mechanisms. The strength of filtering varied little with temperature and precipitation, suggesting that these stage-specific assembly processes are of broad relevance. Third, I evaluate whether traits associated with regional temperature and precipitation patterns can predict community responses to rapid experimental climate change. To avoid the artifacts of in situ climate manipulation, 25 x 25 cm turfs of standing vegetation were transplanted to warmer and wetter sites. Changes in transplanted turf community composition were monitored over five years and compared to a field-parameterized null model. Three of the six traits with spatial associations to temperature predicted species success following transplantation. My results underscore the importance of using ecologically relevant traits when making predictions of community response, and suggest that in our grassland system, architectural traits may exert more influence on initial species response to rapid warming than the more commonly used growth-related traits. This dissertation offers a much-needed empirical exploration of how regional dispersal dynamics, seed and seedling performance, and adult community response interactively shape patterns of plant community diversity. In addition, it demonstrates how species traits, when chosen for their potential mechanistic relevance to community assembly processes, can be valuable hypothesis generators. Future work on plant community assembly should consider plant life stages and relevant traits to refine predictions of community response to climate change...|$|R
