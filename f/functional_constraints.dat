40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} {{plays an}} important role in the regulation of protein function. Phosphorylated residues are generally assumed to be subject to <b>functional</b> <b>constraint,</b> but it has recently been suggested from a comparison of distantly related vertebrate species that most phosphorylated residues evolve at the rates consistent with the surrounding regions. To resolve the controversy, we infer the ancestral phosphoproteome of human and mouse to compare the evolutionary rates of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated serine (S), threonine (T), and tyrosine (Y) residues. This approach enables accurate estimation of evolutionary rates as it does not assume deep conservation of phosphorylated residues. We show that phosphorylated S/T residues tend to evolve more slowly than nonphosphorylated S/T residues not only in disordered but also in ordered protein regions, indicating evolutionary conservation of phosphorylated S/T residues in mammals. Thus, phosphorylated S/T residues tend to be subject to stronger <b>functional</b> <b>constraint</b> than nonphosphorylated residues regardless of the protein regions in which they reside. In contrast, phosphorylated Y residues evolve at similar rates as nonphosphorylated ones. We also find that the human lineage has gained more phosphorylated T residues and lost fewer phosphorylated Y residues than the mouse lineage. The cause of the gain/loss imbalance remains a mystery but should be worth exploring.

The primary <b>functional</b> <b>constraint</b> is formulated as a proximity penalty function such that the design surface is induced to avoid a tolerance envelope around each component. In addition, a constraint based on surface area is formulated to counteract the expansion effect of the proximity constraint.

50|$|Regions of each protein have differing <b>functional</b> <b>constraints</b> (features {{critical}} to the structure and function of the protein). For example, the active site of an enzyme requires certain amino acid residues to be precisely oriented in three dimensions. On the other hand, a protein-protein binding interface may consist of a large surface with constraints on the hydrophobicity or polarity of the amino acid residues. Functionally constrained regions of proteins evolve more slowly than unconstrained regions such as surface loops, giving rise to discernible blocks of conserved sequence when the sequences of a protein family are compared (see multiple sequence alignment). These blocks are most {{commonly referred to as}} motifs, although many other terms are used (blocks, signatures, fingerprints, etc.).

It {{is expected that}} horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distant organisms and lineage-specific gene loss have greater influence on gene content-based phylogenetic analysis than orthologous protein sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. To determine {{the evolution of the}} syntrophic bacterium Symbiobacterium thermophilum, we analyzed phylogenetic relationships among Clostridia on the basis of gene content and orthologous protein sequence comparisons. These comparisons revealed that these 2 phylogenetic relationships are topologically different. Our results suggest that each Clostridia has a species-specific gene content because frequent genetic exchanges or gene losses have occurred during evolution. Specifically, the phylogenetic positions of syntrophic Clostridia were different between these 2 phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that large diversity in the living environments may cause the observed species-specific gene content. S. thermophilum occupied the most distant position from the other syntrophic Clostridia in the gene content-based phylogenetic tree. We identified 32 genes (14 under relaxed selection and 18 under <b>functional</b> <b>constraint)</b> evolving under Symbiobacterium-specific selection on the basis of synonymous-to-nonsynonymous substitution ratios.

50|$|The {{critical}} {{responses to}} the neutral theory that soon appeared {{marked the beginning of}} the neutralist-selectionist debate. In short, selectionists viewed natural selection as the primary or only cause of evolution, even at the molecular level, while neutralists held that neutral mutations were widespread and that genetic drift was a crucial factor in the evolution of proteins. Kimura became the most prominent defender of the neutral theory—which would be his main focus for the rest of his career. With Ohta, he refocused his arguments on the rate at which drift could fix new mutations in finite populations, the significance of constant protein evolution rates, and the <b>functional</b> <b>constraints</b> on protein evolution that biochemists and molecular biologists had described. Though Kimura had initially developed the neutral theory partly as an outgrowth of the classical position within the classical/balance controversy (predicting high genetic load as a consequence of non-neutral mutations), he gradually deemphasized his original argument that segregational load would be impossibly high without neutral mutations (which many selectionists, and even fellow neutralists King and Jukes, rejected).|$|E
