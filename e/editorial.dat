40|$|Abstract: As {{a kind of}} {{discourse}} genre, newspaper <b>editorials</b> are of special importance in EFL studies and contrastive rhetoric. <b>Editorials</b> especially <b>editorials</b> of criticism are written to deliberately influence the social cognition of their readers by making use of different persuasion and argumentation strategies and devices. The use of these devices {{is believed to be}} language and culture-oriented. Therefore, this study aimed at comparing the rhetorical devices employed in the <b>editorials</b> of the American newspaper, The New York Times, and the Australian newspaper, The Australian, by using Richardson (2007) framework of rhetorical devices focusing on Hyperbole, Metaphor and Metonymy. The main purpose was to see to what extent language affects written conventions. The results showed that, <b>editorials</b> of the two newspapers employed the same rhetorical device categories. However, minor differences were observed in the frequency of the categories across <b>editorials.</b> The findings showed that Metonymy was the most frequently used device in both <b>editorials.</b> In contrast, Metaphor was the least used device in the selected newspapers. Therefore, the minor differences seen in <b>editorials</b> can suggest the importance of language over national styles of writing with regard to moods and conventions of persuasion when it comes to <b>editorials...</b>|$|R

However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the <b>editorial</b> board brought about a new <b>editorial</b> policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new <b>editorial</b> board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores and compares persuasion in American and Arabic (Saudi) <b>editorials</b> from a speech act perspective. It {{sheds light on}} {{cultural}} {{similarities and differences between}} American and Arabic (Saudi) cultures in terms of persuasive written discourse. The data came from twenty six Arabic <b>editorials</b> of two distinguished Saudi newspapers, Alriyadh and Al-Jazirah, and another twenty six American <b>editorials</b> from the popular American newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post. This study employed Searle 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) taxonomy of speech acts as a coding system of speech acts. Its findings show that persuasiveness can be accomplished via different ways of manipulation of speech acts in different cultures. Although both American and Arabic <b>editorials</b> prefer the use of strong assertions, they seem to differ with regard to the speech acts of directives and expressives. The results indicate that American directives and expressives are stronger, and more direct and explicit than their Arabic counterparts. Accordingly, this study argues that whereas persuasion in American <b>editorials</b> is accomplished via powerful and explicit propositions, Arabic <b>editorials</b> favor the use of implied propositions persuade their readers. Arabic <b>editorials</b> approach their readers differently and hence try to accomplish persuasiveness {{while at the same time}} save their readers 2 ̆ 7 face. Finally, the current research suggests that <b>editorials</b> in both cultures seem to have similar distributions of speech acts. However, differences are apparent in the way these speech acts are realized and manipulated. ...|$|R
