50|$|A factory ship, {{also known}} as a <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>vessel,</b> is a large ocean-going vessel with {{extensive}} on-board facilities for processing and freezing caught fish or whales. Modern factory ships are automated and enlarged versions of the earlier whalers and their use for fishing has grown dramatically. Some factory ships are equipped to serve as a mother ship.|$|E

50|$|The movie {{revolves}} around the true events of a Lithuanian man named Simas Kudirka, {{who was at the}} time was a radio operator on a Soviet <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>vessel.</b> When his ship meets at sea with a U.S. Coast Guard cutter near Martha's Vineyard in early 1970, Kudirka makes a dramatic leap from the deck, landing on the USCGC Vigilant. He announces that he wishes to defect, but confusion over U.S. policy on defections prevents the Americans from offering him asylum. As the crew of the Vigilant looks on helplessly, Soviet officers are allowed to board the cutter, beat and bind Kudirka, and drag him back to his own ship. This tinderbox political incident occurs during a Soviet/U.S. conference over fishing rights. The ultimate fate of Simas Kudirka provides the core of the script.|$|E
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>vessel,</b> the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|E

5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the [...] "precautionary approach" [...] and the [...] "polluter pays principle." [...] Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called [...] "reverse list" [...] approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 ("the reverse list") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures {{to ensure that the}} issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; sewage sludge; industrial <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> waste; <b>vessels</b> and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea.|$|R

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>processing</b> {{and quality}} control in Malawi are still poorly developed. Traditional <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> methods are widely {{employed}} resulting in considerable post-harvest losses.

40|$|Providing safe-to-eat {{consumer}} {{fish products}} {{is a key}} objective for the Global Aquaculture Industry.

Design of Easy-to-clean <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> machineries is an efficient and innovative perspective which could be a game changer in the Aquaculture Industry. Based on the generic hygienic design principles stated by EHEDG and experience collected in a in a research project in the Norwegian Aquaculture Industry, this paper presents four specific design concepts for state of the art <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> machineries, which is an attempt to interpret EHEDG guidelines to actionable design changes suiting the Norwegian Aquaculture Industry and the type of Original Equipment Manufacturers serving this industry.
