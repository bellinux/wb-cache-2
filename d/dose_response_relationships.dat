40|$|The half-maximal {{inhibitory}} concentration IC[Formula: see text] {{is an important}} pharmacodynamic index of drug effectiveness. To estimate this value, the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship</b> needs to be established, which is generally achieved by fitting monotonic sigmoidal models. However, recent studies on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) mutants developing resistance to antiviral drugs show that the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> curve may not be monotonic. Traditional models can fail for nonmonotonic data and ignore observations that may be of biologic significance. Therefore, we propose a nonparametric model to describe the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship</b> and fit the curve using local polynomial regression. The nonparametric approach is shown to be promising especially for estimating the IC[Formula: see text] of some HIV inhibitory drugs, {{in which there is}} a dose-dependent stimulation of response for mutant strains.

40|$|Abstract: Perceived {{needs for}} {{extensive}} chemical-specific toxicological information have impeded efforts to assess risks and evaluate likely public health protection benefits of possible standards for {{hazardous air pollutants}} (HAPs). This paper discusses opportunities to use effects of HAPs on early effect biomarkers, such as birth weights, to predict likely changes in rare quantal effects of concern that would be relevant for the quantification of likely regulatory benefits from exposure reductions. In the birth weight example, even modest exposures to common air pollutants {{can be seen as}} producing a kind of tax on the limited resources available to the fetus to grow and develop. In contrast to teratogenic effects, <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationships</b> for fetal growth restriction in animals are often nearly linear, suggesting that the developing fetus may not generally have untapped “functional reserve capacity ” that is expected to buffer the effects of modest exposures to toxicants in the traditional toxicological paradigm. Given this mechanistic perspective, supported in part by parallel <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationships</b> between reported cigarette smoking and both birth weight and infant mortality, restriction on fetal growth can be associated with changes in quantal end effects of concern that are more difficult to assess directly in epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|Large {{retrospective}} association {{studies are}} being conducted to identify genetic determinants of statin efficacy. In order to accurately place {{the impact of}} genetic variability into context alongside clinical covariates (e. g., age, gender, co-morbidity, and concomitant medication), these studies need to be conducted in population-based cohorts. The Marshfield Clinic Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) includes the largest population-based DNA Biobank in the United States. We have previously constructed an electronic phenotyping strategy for statin efficacy, using free text clinical documents housed within the PMRP database. This strategy {{is based upon the}} application of natural language processing software, and it has been validated using the electronic medical records from a test set of 100 elderly subjects participating in the PMRP. We now report the application of this phenotyping strategy to the entire PMRP, to construct <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationships</b> for all database participants exposed to atorvastatin. The PMRP database currently contains electronic medical records for more than 19, 000 participants. Our validated electronic phenotyping strategy identified 3801 unique PMRP participants with prior exposure to atorvastatin. Within this nested cohort, 2225 subjects had both a validated pretreatment lipid panel and at least one additional lipid panel on drug. Prior to collating exposure data with clinical lipid data, the data were filtered and limited to only those text events containing an atorvastatin dose. Additional programming was needed to adjust the final dose in situations where patients had split tablets into halves (in an effort to reduce the cost of this medication). The data were then merged to yield <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationships.</b> Mean changes in LDL cholesterol were- 41. 6 mg/dl at 5 mg (S. D. = 26. 9; n= 1064),- 51. 3 mg/dl at 10 mg (S.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{that the use of}} cross-over or dose escalation designs for dose ranging studies in combination with more informative analysis could lead to a better characterisation of the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship.</b> In example presented, the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship</b> for the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl Coenzyme A inhibitors (HMG COA) inhibitor, simvastatin, was estimated from a cross-over study which covered the current recommended dose range (10 to 40 mg). Analysis using nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach demonstrated that the selected doses only covered 20 % (70 % to 90 %) of {{the upper part of the}} estimated <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship.</b> It was concluded that a lower dose strength would be required to allow adjustment within the log-linear portion of the <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship.</b> The clinical implications of potential relationships between the pre-treatment cholesterol level and the model parameters were explored through prediction and simulation. On simulating the relationship between dose and the percentage of patients who would achieve reductions to below a recognised target concentration, it was found that a different set of dosages may better optimise clinical response. Where strict experimental design is invalidated by study design or restricted recruitment, the resulting data can be unbalanced and not easily analysed by standard statistical methods. In the example presented, the number and size of doses of dofetilide used to test for PK/PD differences between patients with ischaemic heart disease (ISH) and healthy volunteers were different. A population PK/PD modelling approach was implemented, and no difference between the two groups could be detected. The Cmax and peak QTc ranged were predicted to be narrower following a fixed dose regimen in comparison to a dose per kilogram regimen. However, after incorporating the PK/PD variability, this was not predicted to manifest into an overall increase in the risk of Torsades de Pointes...|$|R

40|$|The {{shape of}} <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> of {{ionizing}} radiation (IR) induced cancer at low dose region, either linear non-threshold or J-shaped, {{has been a}} debate for a long time. This <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationship</b> can be influenced by built-in capabilities of cells that minimize the fixation of IR-mediated DNA damage as pro-carcinogenic mutations.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare the cell proliferative effects of a range of doses of low level laser therapy (LLLT) at wavelengths of 780, 830 and 904 nm on human breast and immortalised human mammary epithelial cell lines in vitro. Background Data: LLLT is used in the clinical treatment of post-mastectomy lymphoedema, despite safety information being limited and circumstantial. This research was the first step in systematically developing guidelines for the safe clinical use of LLLT in the management of post-mastectomy lymphoedema. Materials and Methods: Human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF- 7), human breast ductal carcinoma (MDA-MB- 435 S) and immortalised human mammary epithelial (SVCT and Bre 80 hTERT) cell lines were irradiated with a single exposure of laser at 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 12 J/cm 2 (?= 780 nm) and 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 15 J/cm 2 (?= 830 and 904 nm). MCF- 7 cells were further irradiated with two and three exposures of all three laser wavelengths. XTT colorimetric assays were utilized to assess cell proliferation 24 hours after irradiation. Results: SVCT cell proliferation significantly increased after exposure to a range of doses at 780 and 904 nm irradiation. MDA-MB- 435 S and Bre 80 hTERT cell lines showed negligible effects with one exposure from all three wavelengths and no <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> <b>relationships</b> were noted. MCF- 7 cells irradiated with 780 nm laser demonstrated an increasing dose response relationship after one exposure and a decreasing dose response relationship after three exposures.

Methods and Materials: A total of 347 patients with head-and-neck tumors were included in this prospective parotid gland <b>dose</b> <b>response</b> study. The patients were treated with either conventional radiotherapy or intensitymodulated radiotherapy. Dose volume histograms for the parotid glands were derived from three-dimensional dose calculations using computed tomography scans. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before and 1 year after radiotherapy. A threshold of 25 % of the pretreatment flow rate was used to define a complication. The evaluated models included the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model, the mean dose model, the relative seriality model, the critical volume model, the parallel functional subunit model, and the dose threshold model. The goodness of fit (GOF) was determined by the deviance and a Monte Carlo hypothesis test. Ranking of the models was based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Results: None of the models was rejected based on the evaluation of the GOF. The mean dose model was ranked as the best model based on the AIC. The TD 50 in these models was approximately 39 Gy.
