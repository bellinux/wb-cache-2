2500|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} was paid to Palin's physical appearance during the 2008 elections. [...] According to Vogue magazine, [...] "Besides being telegenic, [...] had a tough-girl Alaskan résumé that most politicians could only dream of—the protein her family eats comes from fish she has pulled out of the ocean with her own hands and caribou she has shot." [...] Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill. [...] Regarding her appearance, Palin has said, [...] "I've been taken aback by the nasty criticism about my appearance. [...] I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots. [...] A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'To {{compel the}} people {{to give up their}} goods, (General) Zarrouk put many notables in irons and locked them up; one of them was my {{grandfather}}. Their ordeal lasted I don't know how many days. Then my family took a sheet and wrapped up all their jewels and all their land titles. [...] My father had the task of taking all this to Zarrouk to obtain my grandfather's freedom. He {{made his way to the}} encampment where a number of tents stood. [...] Above one of them flew a flag. [...] This was the tent of General Zarrouk, who took all our fortune and freed his prisoners. Ten days later, my grandfather died from the appalling treatment he had suffered. My father did not escape unscathed either. He was conscripted into Zarrouk's army where he served for nineteen years, the longest and hardest years of his life. [...] He urged me to study. [...] 'I don't want you to be brought down to the level of a beast of burden one day' he said. 'I don't want to see you like me, condemned to wear a uniform all your days.' <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> I would do my best by devoting myself completely to my studies.|$|E
2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Starbrow," [...] said he, {{appealing}} to her, [...] "is it not hard? Captain Horton either doubts my veracity or believes that I am only joking when <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that what <b>I</b> have {{just told him}} is plain truth." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> again <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> of my {{willingness}} {{to assist him}} in anything that was not contrary to my allegiance or religion.|$|R
60|$|The Composition of this Engine is very admirable; for, as {{is before}} noted, 'tis all {{made up of}} Feathers, {{and the quality of}} the Feathers, is no less {{wonderful}} than their Composition; and therefore, I hope the Reader will bear with the Description for the sake of the Novelty, since <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> such things as these are not to be seen in every Country.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> with fervour {{that nothing}} would please me better.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that I never had, {{but would}} try to do so if possible.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that in {{whatever}} else I might fail I could promise him industry.|$|E
6000|$|It was nasty, Dolly, and I won't deny it; it was vulgar. But {{what would}} you have done? I could feel Aristides' mild eye sadly on me, and I was sorry for <b>him,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was not sorry for them, till that old man spoke again, so timidly: [...] "It isn't my--it's my wife, Mrs. Homos. Let me {{introduce}} her. But haven't we met before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The only hotel, <b>I</b> have <b>assured</b> <b>him.</b> The Meurice? Chut! I snap my fingers. The Ritz? Bah! Once again I snap my fingers. 'In all Paris {{there is}} no hotel like this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Should I {{have the}} good fortune to meet Monsieur le Vicomte in France, <b>I</b> shall <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that Madame is in good hands" [...] (he swept an exultant look at me) [...] "and enjoying herself." ...|$|R
60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> I had an {{excellent}} pair of garters, and would go and hang myself forthwith.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> {{that these}} were the facts, and stood waiting {{to hear what he}} would say next.|$|E
6000|$|... “With an {{artificial}} foot—and they make excellent ones—you will be stumping ships’ galleys {{to the end}} of time,” <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> jovially.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{comes from}} McGill," [...] the {{chairman}} boomed out. [...] "I {{never heard of}} McGill myself but <b>I</b> can <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> he's welcome. He's going to lecture to us on,--what did you say {{it was to be}} about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tupman,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'a {{secret of}} some delicacy, {{in which that}} lady is concerned, {{is the cause of}} a {{difference}} which has just arisen between this gentleman and myself. When <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him,</b> in your presence, that it has no relation to himself, and is not in any way connected with his affairs, I need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to dispute it, he expresses a doubt of my veracity, which I shall consider extremely insulting.' As Mr. Pickwick said this, he looked encyclopedias at Mr. Peter Magnus.|$|R
6000|$|... "This gentleman," [...] said Sir William Ashton, [...] "will, I trust, not {{regret the}} trouble {{we have given}} <b>him,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> of the {{gratitude}} of the Lord Keeper for the greatest service which one man ever rendered to another--for the life of my child--for my own life, which he has saved by his bravery and presence of mind. He will, I am sure, permit us to request----" [...] "Request nothing of ME, my lord," [...] said the stranger, in a stern and peremptory tone; [...] "I am the Master of Ravenswood." ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked His Highness for his condescension, but <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that I {{had made}} up my mind not to marry again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> of the contrary, {{and made}} him sit down, while I told him of my brother's improvement, and anxiety {{respecting}} himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that I did not; {{and begged}} him so earnestly to {{enlighten}} me, that he stopped {{as he was}} walking away.|$|E
60|$|He stood mute a good while, but {{afterwards}} {{told me he}} had a {{great deal}} more to say if <b>I</b> could <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> would not take ill whatever freedom he might use with me in his discourse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Tarzan," [...] he said, [...] "may indeed {{wish that}} he had never befriended me, for <b>I</b> can <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that he has won the enmity of two of the most unmitigated scoundrels in all Europe. Avoid them, monsieur, by all means." ...|$|R
5000|$|My {{reader will}} judge of its malignity smell inside prisonswhen <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that my cloaths {{were in my}} first {{journeys}} so offensive that in a post chaise I could not bear the windows drawn up: and was therefore often obliged to travel on horseback. The leaves of my memorandum-book were often so tainted, that I could not use it till after spreading it {{an hour or two}} before the fire: and even my antidote, a vial of vinegar, has after using it in a few prisons, become intolerably disagreeable. — John Howard, prison reformer, 1777 ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that I had no {{intention}} of dropping it, and that I should do everything in my power to protect Mr. Kilbright.|$|E
60|$|I {{little thought}} what it was, little thought in how {{short a time}} I should {{understand}} it better, but <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> that I had confidence in him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The idlest curiosity," [...] <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I {{know nothing}} about them except that they are distinctive, and one cannot fail, of course, to admire the young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Brand imagines {{perhaps that}} I bear him some ill-will for that {{previous}} little rencontre between us, in which, by the bye, I {{must admit that}} I had very much the worst of it. <b>I</b> can <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> most sincerely {{that it is not}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas imprudent, Frances; nay, it was unkind," [...] he cried, {{throwing}} {{himself in}} a chair, [...] "to fly {{at the very moment}} that <b>I</b> had <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> of safety! <b>I</b> can almost persuade myself that you delight in creating points of difference in our feelings and duties." ...|$|R
6000|$|He took Fergus {{a little}} apart {{and spoke to}} him very earnestly {{for two or three}} minutes, and then {{returning}} to Waverley, said, 'I believe I have satisfied Colonel Mac-Ivor that his resentment was founded upon a misconception, to which, indeed, I myself gave rise; and I trust Mr. Waverley is too generous to harbour any recollection of what is past when <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that such is the case. You must state this matter properly to your clan, Vich Ian Vohr, to prevent a recurrence of their precipitate violence.' Fergus bowed. 'And now, gentlemen, let me have the pleasure to see you shake hands.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "The affair {{happened}} in a very dubious sort of place. I don't think I shall hear anything more about it unless from Tapilow himself." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> he did me injustice; but {{my sense}} of {{humanity}} was so much affected by the horridness {{of the fact that}} I could scarce find breath to answer with.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really mean}} it," [...] <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I am here {{out of the}} idlest curiosity. I am by {{profession}} a scribbler, and I am {{in search of an}} idea." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} it was a {{reasonable}} caution in <b>him,</b> and <b>I</b> would <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that, whatever he said should not do them any prejudice; and, to convince him of it, I gave him my word that I would not put them to death on any account whatsoever, merely for his sake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, sir. Being so {{recently}} from Ireland, <b>I</b> could <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that even his most devoted adherents, there, are of opinion that no rising could be attended with success, unless backed by French arms, and especially by {{the aid of}} the Irish Brigade, which has already won such renown for itself, and whose appearance would excite the greatest enthusiasm among all Irishmen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can get him}} up peaceably if <b>I</b> can <b>assure</b> <b>him</b> that he'll {{only get}} {{a day or so}} in the cooler, with full rations and no beatings.
