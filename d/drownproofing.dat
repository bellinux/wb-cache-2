5000|$|Once {{they had}} {{mastered}} the <b>Drownproofing</b> technique, students {{learned how to}} stay afloat with their wrists and ankles bound, swim 50 yd underwater, and retrieve diving rings {{from the bottom of}} the pool using their teeth. Lanoue published a book called <b>Drownproofing,</b> a New Technique for Water Safety in 1963. Georgia Tech dropped the course from its curriculum in 1988, as part of a downsizing of its physical education and athletics department.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drownproofing</b> {{has been}} for many years widely taught to {{recruits}} in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drownproofing</b> was {{developed}} by swimming coach Fred Lanoue, known to students as Crankshaft because of his limping gait. It was first taught in 1940. His method was so successful that it gained national recognition, and Georgia Tech soon made it a requirement for graduation, until 1988. The US Navy also took interest, and adopted {{it as part of}} their standard training. [...] It is claimed that during Lanoue's time teaching at Tech from 1936 to 1964, he taught <b>drownproofing</b> to some 20,000 students.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drownproofing</b> is {{a method}} for {{surviving}} in water disaster scenarios without sinking or drowning. It is also famous as a class once required at the Georgia Institute of Technology.|$|E
5000|$|Reagh [...] "Doc" [...] Wetmore, {{swimming}} {{coach at}} Boston University, shared Fred Lanoue's enthusiasm for <b>Drownproofing</b> {{and continued to}} teach the technique until his retirement {{at the end of}} 2005.|$|E
50|$|The main {{criticism}} of <b>Drownproofing</b> is that, {{with the body}} almost totally immersed, heat loss will be greater than with vigorous swimming or treading water, with the consequent earlier onset of hypothermia. But other sources suggest that heat loss is increased by vigorous action, because it displaces relatively warmer water that is trapped by the subject’s clothing. In any cold water situation, the main objective should be {{to get out of}} the water and find shelter and dry clothing. In any case, <b>Drownproofing</b> should never be regarded as a substitute for the normal safety precautions recommended for any water activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} heat loss {{can be reduced}} by using the Heat Escape Lessening Posture (H.E.L.P). The Heat Escape Lessening Posture was {{designed}} for use with a Personal Floatation Device. Essentially the person grabs his/her knees to reduce surface area exposed to the water and centralize body heat. It can be adapted and used {{as part of the}} <b>drownproofing</b> technique, but is far more challenging.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Drownproofing</b> terminology, {{the great}} {{majority}} of people are “floaters.” That is to say that, with the lungs fully inflated, they have slightly less specific gravity than water and will not start to sink until they exhale. An average floater has 3 - 4 lb of positive buoyancy in fresh water. “Sinkers” can also benefit from a modified technique, but will find it more difficult to learn and will probably need specialised coaching.|$|E
5000|$|US Navy SEALs. They {{travel to}} Virginia {{to carry out}} [...] "simulated" [...] Navy SEAL {{training}} with some former US Navy SEALs, whose beach-based challenges from long beach runs to [...] "surf torture" [...] leave them physically and emotionally drained. After the first day, Carla suffers from dehydration and exhaustion, but must face her fear of water in a <b>drownproofing</b> challenge where the volunteers repeatedly sink in a pool with their ankles and wrists bound.|$|E
5000|$|From 1940 to 1987, Tech {{offered a}} class called <b>Drownproofing,</b> which was {{required}} for graduation for students. The class was developed by Coach Fred Lanoue for the Naval School, which was located at Georgia Tech before and during World War II. He taught students how to float in water for {{extended periods of time}} with ankles and wrists bound, how (unbound) to swim 50 yards (46 m) underwater, and other water survival skills. At the time it was considered a prime example of the difficulty of Tech's curriculum, and referred to in jest by students as [...] "Drowning 101." ...|$|E
50|$|In the <b>Drownproofing</b> {{survival}} technique, {{the subject}} floats in a relaxed, near-vertical posture, {{with the top}} of the head just above the surface. Using the arms or legs to exert a downward pressure, the subject raises himself sufficiently so that the mouth is above the surface and a breath is taken, before dropping back into the relaxed float. This is done several times a minute (typically between 5 and 10), depending upon the needs of the individual. It is important to keep the lungs fully inflated for the maximum possible time and to exhale and inhale rapidly when a breath is taken.The technique is easy to learn and does not require arduous training or a high standard of physical fitness. With practice, it is possible to remain afloat in this way for a long time with minimal effort. Lanoue taught his students to perform the technique with hands and feet tied, thus demonstrating that it is possible to survive even when injured or otherwise disabled.|$|E
