25|$|Bangladesh was (mostly) the {{province}} of Bengal in India until 1947, then it became part of Pakistan. It became an independent nation in 1971. Women have had equal suffrage since 1947, and they have reserved seats in parliament. Bangladesh is notable <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>since</b> 1991, two women, namely Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia, have served terms as the country's Prime Minister continuously. Women have traditionally played a minimal role in politics beyond the anomaly of the two leaders; few used to run against men; few have been ministers. Recently, however, women have become more active in politics, with several prominent ministerial posts given to women and women participating in national, district and municipal elections against men and winning on several occasions. Choudhury and Hasanuzzaman argue that the strong patriarchal traditions of Bangladesh explain why women are so reluctant to stand up in politics.|$|E

2500|$|Article 200 was {{purposeful}} to Ceaușescu regime <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> 1970, {{it offered}} a pry to strengthen social control. These restrictions under the Penal Code were strictly unique to Romania {{and no other}} European country. The restrictions only included relationships and those who considered themselves homosexual were not punished but were instead considered as mentally ill. In the early 1990s, when gay rights activists, international human rights organizations, and the European Council started to press the Romanian government to decriminalize homosexuality and ensure equal rights for all citizens, the conservative political elites and the Orthodox Church claimed that sexual minorities {{did not exist in}} Romania prior to 1989 and that homosexuality was only an undesirable product of capitalism, a life style induced by the Western democracies, and {{not a part of the}} heteronormative Romanian culture. In 1995, Romania applied for EU membership. As of 1995, it was one of only three countries in Europe that still criminalized homosexuality. Due mainly to strong [...] international pressure, in 1996, the first paragraph of Article 200 was amended and only same-sex sexual activities performed in public or considered a source of public scandal were punished by the law. In 2000, Romania began EU accession negotiations and the country had to demonstrate progress in harmonizing its laws with the EU legislation. In particular, Romania had to prove that sexual minority human rights were not violated by the country's policies and legislation. And the possibility of eventual entry into the European Union had a powerful effect on legal change. In January 2001, Adrian Năstase government adopted the Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, which eliminated Art. 200 of the Penal Code and adjusted other articles referring to sex offenses to avoid discriminatory treatment of offenders. This ordinance came into force in January 2002, after President Ion Iliescu signed the new law.|$|E

'There is Willis, all natty and jaunty and gay, Who {{says his}} best things in so foppish a way, With conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em, That one hardly knows whether {{to thank him}} for saying 'em; Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose, Just {{conceive}} of a Muse with a ring in her nose!
