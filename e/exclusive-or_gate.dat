40|$|Many optical {{processing}} systems rely critically {{on the availability}} of high performance, electrically-addressed spatial light modulators. Ferroelectric liquid crystal over silicon is an attractive spatial light modulator technology because it combines two well matched technologies. Ferroelectric liquid crystal modulating materials exhibit fast switching times with low operating voltages, while very large scale silicon integrated circuits offer high-frequency, low power operation, and versatile functionality. This thesis describes the design and characterisation of the SBS 256 - a general purpose 256 x 256 pixel ferroelectric liquid crystal over silicon spatial light modulator that incorporates a static-RAM latch and an <b>exclusive-OR</b> <b>gate</b> at each pixel. The static-RAM latch provides robust data storage under high read-beam intensities, while the <b>exclusive-OR</b> <b>gate</b> permits the liquid crystal layer to be fully and efficiently charge balanced. The SBS 256 spatial light modulator operates in a binary mode. However, many applications, including helmet-mounted displays and optoelectronic implementations of artificial neural networks, require devices with some level of grey-scale capability. The 2 kHz frame rate of the device, permits temporal multiplexing {{to be used as a}} means of generating discrete grey-scale in real-time. A second integrated circuit design is also presented. This prototype neuraldetector backplane consists of a 4 x 4 array of optical-in, electronic-out processing units. These can sample the temporally multiplexed grey-scale generated by the SBS 256. The neurons implement the post-synaptic summing and thresholding function, and can respond to both positive and negative activations - a requirement of many artificial neural network models...|$|E

The music accumulator chip generates a pointer index at which the samples are taken from the waveform memory. One of the main components of the VLSI chip, a carry look-ahead adder was designed and simulated in SPICE. Two different designs of the exclusive-or gates were simulated as well. The layout of various components of the adder, namely, the carry function, the exclusive-or gates and inverters were all done on a CAD (Computer Aided Design) program called MAGIC. All these components, together with the shift register cells designed by Professor Silvio Eberhardt, were placed in a 40 pin 2 mm by 2 mm test chip, fabricated by the MOSIS n-well process. After a few months, four identical chips were received and tests were performed on the individual components (except the shift registers) to see if everything works.

According to several sources [2], the electronic ID market {{is expected to increase}} by more than 50 % per annum over the three coming years, excluding China. To cost-effectively address this foreseen explosion, a very inexpensive memory card (phonecard-like card) capable of performing fingerprint matching is paramount. This paper presents such a solution. The proposed protocol is based on the following idea: the card stores the userâ€™s fingerprint information to which random minutiae were added at enrolment time (we denote this scrambled template by t). The card also stores a binary string w encoding which of the minutiae in t actually belong to the holder. When an identification session starts, the terminal reads t from the card and, based upon the incoming scanner data, determines which of the minutiae in t are genuine. The terminal forms a candidate w â€² and sends it to the card. All the card needs to do is test that the Hamming weight of w âŠ• w â€² is smaller than a security threshold d. It follows that the card only needs to embark passive data storage capabilities, one <b>exclusive-or</b> <b>gate,</b> a shift register, a counter and a comparator (less than 40 logical gates). ...|$|E
