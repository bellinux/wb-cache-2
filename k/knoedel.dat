Only one or two village men came in, and these soon went again; the place was dead still. Only at a long table {{on the opposite side}} of the room were seated seven or eight men, ragged, disreputable, some impudent--another came in late; the landlady gave them all thick soup with dumplings and bread and meat, serving them in a sort of brief disapprobation. They sat at the long table, eight or nine tramps and beggars and wanderers out of work and they ate with a sort of cheerful callousness and brutality for the most part, and as if ravenously, looking round and grinning sometimes, subdued, cowed, like prisoners, and yet impudent.

40|$|Paradoxon aus der Verkehrsplanung ‚Äù in {{the journal}} Unternehmensforschung. The paper was {{inspired}} by a seminar given by W. <b>Knoedel</b> in Muenster in 1967, when Braess was 29 years old. In the paper, Braess set out to clarify distinct concepts of travel behavior and presented what has since become the renowned Braess paradox. The paper was accepted by the edi-tor of the journal although Braess at that time was unaware of the transportation literature to that date, including the paper of Wardrop (1952) that stated two widely quoted criteria of traffic network utiliza-tion that have come to be termed user optimal and system optimal, respectively, based on similar terms introduced by Dafermos and Sparrow (1969).
