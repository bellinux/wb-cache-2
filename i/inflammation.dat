5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, <b>inflammation</b> would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, <b>inflammation</b> may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. <b>Inflammation</b> causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (<b>inflammation</b> of the cervix) or vaginitis (<b>inflammation</b> of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (<b>inflammation</b> of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> is {{a normal}} part of the human immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing <b>inflammation),</b> gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. <b>Inflammation</b> interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the <b>inflammation</b> continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, <b>inflammation</b> in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of <b>inflammation</b> and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of <b>inflammation,</b> nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E

5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{responses}} of the immune system to infection. The symptoms of <b>inflammation</b> are redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue. <b>Inflammation</b> is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines, which are released by injured or infected cells. Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with <b>inflammation,</b> and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes). Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells; chemokines that promote chemotaxis; and interferons that have anti-viral effects, such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell. Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released. These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This <b>inflammation</b> may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous vaginal discharge and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, <b>inflammation</b> may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. <b>Inflammation</b> is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the <b>inflammation</b> is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Inflammation</b> of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause <b>inflammation</b> of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
40|$|The Institute of Nuclear Energy Research of Taiwan has {{developed}} a dynamic coincidence detection device for positron emitted radiotracer pharmacodynamic study in small mice models. In this study, we set up an experimental paradigm by determining [fluorine- 18]- 2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-D-glucose ([18 F]FDG) dynamic uptake in tumors and <b>inflammations</b> in nude mice {{as the foundation for}} future applications in therapy development. Histopathology and micro-autoradiography of these tumors and <b>inflammations</b> were obtained for confirmation. Dynamic coincidence planar images of six tumors and two <b>inflammations</b> in nude mice were acquired over 4 hours immediately after injection of 25. 9 MBq of [18 F]FDG into the right thigh of each animal. After image reconstruction, the lesion-to-background ratios were calculated in regions of interest over the lesion and contralateral thigh to determine the equilibrium status of the radiotracer. All mice were sacrificed for histopathologic examination and six of the mice were examined with micro-autoradiography. [18 F]FDG uptake in tumors and <b>inflammations</b> both reached equilibrium about 3 hours after injection. At equilibrium, [18 F]FDG uptake into tumors was two to four times higher than the background. Uptake into the 4 -day and 8 -day <b>inflammations</b> was 2. 3 and 5. 5 times higher than the background, respectively. Histopathology showed macrophage and neutrophil infiltration around the tumors and in the <b>inflammations.</b> Micro-autoradiography showed dense silver grains in the granulation tissue surrounding the tumors and <b>inflammations.</b> The preliminary results suggested that dynamic [18 F]FDG coincidence planar imaging can help in determining the suitable time for static [18 F]FDG imaging in nude mice models. The optimal time for static [18 F]FDG positron emission tomography imaging was around 3 hours after injection. The paradigm for determining a dynamic [18 F]FDG uptake pattern was demonstrated for future new therapeutic drug experimental use...|$|R

5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar <b>inflammation</b> and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing <b>inflammation</b> in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces <b>inflammation.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of <b>inflammation</b> by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of <b>inflammation</b> in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
