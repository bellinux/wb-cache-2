5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan {{will be allowed to}} live one more month <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young because he wanted to include the optimism of youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence and its effects on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E

Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect {{for the victims of}} Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests.

25|$|In {{the papal}} {{document}} Amoris Laetitia, issued in 2016, Francis encouraged better understanding from {{all members of}} the church on the acceptance of gay people, without suggesting any specific doctrinal changes. Instead, he reiterated the need <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> to be respected regardless of their sexual orientation, and to be free from threats of aggression and violence. He avoided any recognition of unions between same sex couples, but rather maintained that these were not equal to heterosexual unions. Some parts of the media interpreted his remarks as more moderate on the issue of homosexuality than that taken by church leaders in previous years.|$|E

The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value.

25|$|Traditionally, {{contact lenses}} for {{keratoconus}} {{have been the}} 'hard' or RGP variety, although manufacturers have also produced specialized 'soft' or hydrophilic lenses and, most recently, silicone hydrogel lenses. A soft lens {{has a tendency to}} conform to the conical shape of the cornea, thus diminishing its effect. To counter this, hybrid lenses have been developed which are hard in the centre and encompassed by a soft skirt. However, soft or earlier generation hybrid lenses did not prove effective <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person.</b> Early generation lenses have been discontinued. The fourth generation of hybrid lens technology has improved, giving more people an option that combines the comfort of a soft lens with the visual acuity of an RGP lens.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand gathers {{information}} on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> in New Zealand on census night but respondents {{are able to}} object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E

25|$|The Han {{taxation}} {{system was}} based on two taxes; a land property tax and a poll tax. The average individual's tax burden consisted of one-thirtieth of the output on land, and a poll tax of 20 coins paid <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> between 7 and 14, with another poll tax for those above 14. Late in the Han dynasty, the taxation rate for agriculture was reduced to one-hundredth, the lost revenue being made up with increased poll taxes. Merchants were charged at double the individual's rate. Another {{important component of the}} taxation system was Corvee labour. Every able-bodied man, defined as a man in good health above 20, was eligible for two years of military service or one month of military service and one year of corvee labour (later those above 56 were exempt from any military or corvee labour service).|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 2013 {{during a}} meeting with {{evacuees}} from the Miyakoji district of Tamura, Fukushima Prefecture and central government officials, the announcement was made that the residents {{would be allowed to}} return to their homes in mid-August 2013, although the radiation levels in residential areas still ranged between 0.32 and 0.54 microsieverts per hour, much higher than the government's goal of 0.23 microsieverts per hour. However, decontamination efforts in the Miyakoji district were declared completed. When asked, the officials refused to prolong the decontamination efforts, arguing that exposure to radiation would differ <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person.</b> The 0.23 microsievert per hour limit would lead to an accumulated radiation exposure exceeding 1 millisievert for people that would stay outdoors for eight hours a day. Instead the officials offered the evacuees a new type of dosimeter so that they could check their own radiation exposures, and in this way take responsibility for their own safety.|$|E
25|$|Franklin {{kicked his}} 100th {{goal for the}} home-and-away season against Carlton in round 22 at Etihad Stadium, {{becoming}} {{the first player to}} kick 100 goals in a season since Tony Lockett in 1998, and the first Hawthorn player since Jason Dunstall in 1996. Upon reaching the milestone, thousands of supporters stormed the field and formed a large huddle around Franklin, who was promptly ushered from the field and into the change rooms until the supporters had cleared. Prior to the match, the AFL had warned of a $6000 fine <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> who jumped the fence. He also was the first player of Aboriginal descent to achieve this. He then added to his tally by kicking another eight goals in the qualifying final against the Western Bulldogs, equalling Dermott Brereton's record for the most goals kicked by a Hawthorn player in a finals match. He kicked just one goal against St Kilda in the preliminary final, before Hawthorn {{went on to win the}} premiership. Although Franklin did not play a large part in the grand final, his two goals brought his season tally up to 113 goals. Franklin was named as full forward in the 2008 All-Australian team, his first ever selection; he then received his first Peter Crimmins Medal for his outstanding season.|$|E
