5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and <b>decoherence,</b> with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum <b>decoherence.</b> This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of <b>decoherence</b> also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. <b>Decoherence</b> is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. <b>Decoherence</b> times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant <b>decoherence.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{issues are}} more {{difficult}} for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to <b>decoherence</b> time, hence any operation must be completed {{much more quickly than}} the <b>decoherence</b> time.|$|E
25|$|Alternatives to the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} {{include the}} many-worlds interpretation, the De Broglie–Bohm (pilot-wave) interpretation, and quantum <b>decoherence</b> theories.|$|E
25|$|If {{the error}} rate is small enough, {{it is thought}} to be {{possible}} to use quantum error correction, which corrects errors due to <b>decoherence,</b> thereby allowing the total calculation time to be longer than the <b>decoherence</b> time. An often cited figure for required error rate in each gate is 10−4. This implies that each gate must be able to perform its task in one 10,000th of the coherence time of the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} relative state formulation {{is due to}} Hugh Everett in 1957. Later, this formulation was popularized and renamed many-worlds by Bryce Seligman DeWitt in the 1960s and 1970s. The <b>decoherence</b> {{approaches to}} interpreting quantum theory have been further explored and developed, becoming quite popular. MWI {{is one of many}} multiverse hypotheses in physics and philosophy. It is currently considered a mainstream interpretation along with the other <b>decoherence</b> interpretations, collapse theories (including the historical Copenhagen interpretation), and hidden variable theories such as the Bohmian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|However {{classical}} and quantum calculations show that quantum <b>decoherence</b> effects do {{not play a}} role in brain activity. Indeed, macroscopic quantum states have only ever been observed in superconductors near absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|Wojciech H. Zurek (2005) has {{produced}} a derivation of the Born rule, where <b>decoherence</b> has replaced Deutsch's informatic assumptions. Lutz Polley (2000) {{has produced}} Born rule derivations where the informatic assumptions are replaced by symmetry arguments.|$|E
25|$|Stapp's {{claim that}} quantum Zeno effect is robust against {{environmental}} <b>decoherence</b> directly contradicts a basic theorem in quantum information theory that acting with projection operators upon the density matrix of a quantum system can only increase the system's Von Neumann entropy.|$|E
25|$|Charles Sebens and Sean M. Carroll, {{building}} on work by Lev Vaidman, proposed {{a similar approach}} based on self-locating uncertainty. In this approach, <b>decoherence</b> creates multiple identical copies of observers, who can assign credences to being on different branches using the Born rule.|$|E
25|$|Talk of {{probability}} in Everett presumes {{the existence of}} a preferred basis to identify measurement outcomes for the probabilities to range over. But {{the existence of a}} preferred basis can only be established by the process of <b>decoherence,</b> which is itself probabilistic or arbitrary.|$|E
25|$|A Hahn echo decay {{experiment}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the <b>decoherence</b> which is not refocused by the 180° pulse. In simple cases, an exponential decay is measured which is described by the T2 time.|$|E
25|$|The reason inter-world {{communication}} {{seems like}} a possibility is because <b>decoherence</b> which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete, therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them, and these should be measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 International Journal of Theoretical Physics article, but the technology it requires involves human-level artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} aspect {{is the relationship}} between the Schrödinger equation and wavefunction collapse. In the oldest Copenhagen interpretation, particles follow the Schrödinger equation except during wavefunction collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of quantum <b>decoherence</b> theory allowed alternative approaches (such as the Everett many-worlds interpretation and consistent histories), wherein the Schrödinger equation is always satisfied, and wavefunction collapse should be explained {{as a consequence of the}} Schrödinger equation.|$|E
25|$|The many-minds {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} extends the many-worlds interpretation by proposing that the distinction between worlds should be made {{at the level of}} the mind of an individual observer. The concept was first introduced in 1970 by H. Dieter Zeh as a variant of the Hugh Everett interpretation in connection with quantum <b>decoherence,</b> and later (in 1981) explicitly called a many or multi-consciousness interpretation. The name many-minds interpretation was first used by David Albert and Barry Loewer in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of <b>decoherence</b> does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E
25|$|Such a test as {{described}} by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe {{and not for the}} single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to <b>decoherence,</b> something which is proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).|$|E
25|$|In their {{reply to}} Tegmark's paper, also {{published}} in Physical Review E, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszyński and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark {{did not address}} the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a <b>decoherence</b> time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Vienna {{group also}} {{demonstrated}} the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrin—a flat biodye with {{an extension of}} about 2nm and a mass of 614u. For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer. In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to {{some aspects of the}} quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain <b>decoherence</b> mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000u has been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum <b>decoherence,</b> which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 David Bohm {{developed}} <b>decoherence,</b> an explanatory {{mechanism for}} the appearance of wave function collapse. Bohm applied <b>decoherence</b> to Louis DeBroglie's pilot wave theory, producing Bohmian mechanics, the first successful hidden variables interpretation of quantum mechanics. [...] Collapse was avoided [...] by Hugh Everett in 1957 in his relative state interpretation. [...] <b>Decoherence</b> was largely ignored until the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|... {{electron}} spins uses electron {{holes in}} a semiconductor at low (mK) temperatures {{which are a}} lot less vulnerable to <b>decoherence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|MWI response: the <b>decoherence</b> or [...] "splitting" [...] or [...] "branching" [...] is {{complete}} when the measurement {{is complete}}. In Dirac notation a measurement is complete when: ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scientists}} including Arthur Compton and Martin Heisenberg {{have suggested}} that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely, due to the rapid <b>decoherence</b> time of quantum systems at room temperature. The standard view, however, is that this <b>decoherence</b> is [...] overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} {{was originally}} most popular, quantum <b>decoherence</b> has gained popularity. [...] Thus the many-worlds interpretation {{has been gaining}} acceptance. [...] Moreover, the strictly formalist position, shunning interpretation, has been challenged by proposals for falsifiable experiments that might one day distinguish among interpretations, as by measuring an AI consciousness or via quantum computing.|$|E
2500|$|In many-worlds, the {{subjective}} appearance of wavefunction collapse {{is explained by}} the mechanism of quantum <b>decoherence,</b> and {{this is supposed to}} resolve all of the correlation paradoxes of quantum theory, such as the EPR paradox and Schrödinger's cat, since every possible outcome of every event defines or exists in its own [...] "history" [...] or [...] "world".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{simplifications}} {{are used}} in this sequence: no <b>decoherence</b> is included and each spin experiences perfect pulses during which the environment provides no spreading. Six spins are shown above and these are not {{given the chance to}} dephase significantly. The spin echo technique is more useful when the spins have dephased more significantly such as in the animation below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Penrose {{proposed}} that the Schrödinger–Newton equation mathematically describes the basis states involved in a gravitationally induced wavefunction collapse scheme. Penrose suggests that a superposition {{of two or more}} quantum states which have a significant amount of mass displacement ought to be unstable and reduce to one of the states within a finite time. He hypothesises that there exists a [...] "preferred" [...] set of states which could collapse no further, specifically the stationary states of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. A macroscopic system can therefore never be in a spatial superposition since the nonlinear gravitational self-interaction immediately leads to a collapse to a stationary state of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. According to Penrose's idea, when a quantum particle is measured, there is an interplay of this nonlinear collapse and environmental <b>decoherence.</b> The gravitational interaction leads to the reduction of the environment to one distinct state and <b>decoherence</b> leads to the localisation of the particle, e.g. as a dot on a screen.|$|E
2500|$|Another reply is {{that the}} {{interaction}} {{taking place in the}} human body may not be described by [...] "billiard ball" [...] classical mechanics. If a nondeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct then microscopic events are indeterminate, where the degree of determinism increases with the scale of the system (see Quantum <b>decoherence).</b> Philosophers Karl Popper and John Eccles and physicist Henry Stapp have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale.|$|E
2500|$|As with pulsed NMR, the Hahn echo {{is central}} to many pulsed EPR {{experiment}}s. A Hahn echo decay experiment {{can be used to}} measure the dephasing time, as shown in the animation below. The size of the echo is recorded for different spacings of the two pulses. This reveals the <b>decoherence,</b> which is not refocused by the [...] pulse. In simple cases, an exponential decay is measured, which is described by the [...] time.|$|E
2500|$|The act of {{measurement}} can {{interact with the}} system state in peculiar ways, as found in double-slit experiments. [...] The Copenhagen interpretation holds that the myriad probabilities across a quantum field are unreal, yet {{that the act of}} observation/measurement collapses the wavefunction and sets a single possibility to become real. [...] Yet quantum <b>decoherence</b> grants that all the possibilities can be real, and that the act of observation/measurement sets up new subsystems.|$|E
2500|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is {{an interpretation of}} quantum mechanics in which a universal wavefunction obeys the same deterministic, reversible laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and irreversible) wavefunction collapse associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by <b>decoherence,</b> which occurs when states interact with the environment producing entanglement, repeatedly [...] "splitting" [...] the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories—effectively distinct universes within a greater multiverse.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the early}} 20th century on, {{occasional}} {{reports about the}} structure of PANI were published. [...] Subsequent to his investigation of other highly-conductive organic materials, MacDiarmid demonstrated the conductive states of polyaniline which arose upon protonic doping of the emeraldine form of polyaniline. [...] Conductive polymers such as polyaniline remain of widespread interest, providing an opportunity to address fundamental issues of importance to condensed matter physics, including, for example, the metal-insulator transition, the Peierls Instability and quantum <b>decoherence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On a {{somewhat}} more serious level, Ian Stewart's novel Flatterland, (a sequel to Flatland) attempts to explain many concepts in modern mathematics and physics through the device of having a young female Flatlander explore {{other parts of the}} [...] "Mathiverse". [...] Schrödinger's Cat {{is just one of the}} many strange Mathiverse denizens she and her guide meet; the cat is still uncertain whether it is alive or dead, long after it left the box. [...] Her guide, the Space Hopper, reassures the Cat with a modern view of quantum <b>decoherence.</b> Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a story entitled [...] "Schrödinger's Cat" [...] in 1974 (reprinted in The Compass Rose, published in 1982), which also deals with <b>decoherence.</b> Greg Egan's novel Quarantine, billed as [...] "a story of quantum catastrophe", features an alternative solution to the paradox: [...] in Egan's version of quantum mechanics, the wave function does not collapse naturally. [...] Only certain living things—human beings among them—collapse the wave function of things they observe. [...] Humans are therefore highly dangerous to other lifeforms which require the full diversity of uncollapsed wavefunctions to survive.|$|E
2500|$|MWI {{removes the}} observer-dependent {{role in the}} quantum {{measurement}} process by replacing wavefunction collapse with quantum <b>decoherence.</b> Since {{the role of the}} observer {{lies at the heart of}} most if not all [...] "quantum paradoxes," [...] this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, the EPR paradox, von Neumann's [...] "boundary problem" [...] and even wave-particle duality. Quantum cosmology also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.|$|E
2500|$|In general, his {{research}} is primarily focused on investigating circuit QED (cQED) systems and their applications in superconducting quantum computing. These include implementing quantum gates, identifying and eliminating sources of quantum <b>decoherence</b> to extend qubit lifetimes, and creating solid-state architectures in which quantum error correction is possible. In addition, he conducts research into [...] "hybrid quantum systems"; cQED systems interacting with Rydberg atoms and semiconductor quantum dots to combine [...] "the long coherence times available in microscopic quantum systems {{with the strong}} interactions and integration available in solid state systems... for strong interactions with control fields and thus fast manipulation of the quantum state of a system." ...|$|E
