25|$|In {{the key of}} C major {{the first}} degree of the scale, called the tonic, is the note C itself, so a C major chord, a triad built on the note C, may be called the one chord of that key and notated in Roman numerals as I. The same C major chord {{can be found in}} other scales: it forms chord III in the key of A minor (A–B–C) and chord IV in the key of G major (G–A–B–C). This {{numbering}} lets us see the job a chord <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the current key and tonality.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{is neither}} a mere {{gatherer}} of data nor a simple teller of tales – he is both. While Herodotus is certainly concerned with giving accurate accounts of events, this does not preclude for him the insertion of powerful mythological elements into his narrative, elements which will aid him in expressing the truth of matters under his study. Thus to understand what Herodotus <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the Histories, we must not impose strict demarcations between the man as mythologist and the man as historian, or between the work as myth and the work as history. As James Romm has written, Herodotus worked under a common ancient Greek cultural assumption that the way events are remembered and retold (e.g. in myths or legends) produces a valid kind of understanding, even when this retelling is not entirely factual. For Herodotus, then, it takes both myth and history to produce truthful understanding.|$|E

Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his De Telegraaf column, [...] "I don't know what to say about it or what Rafael van der Vaart <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> Hamburg."

2500|$|In mid 2013, {{a mentally}} fragile Sharon began feeling nostalgic {{regarding}} {{her relationship with}} Nick, having been dumped by Adam. In a twist, it is revealed that the original paternity test conducted years earlier to determine whether Summer (now aged to 18 years old) was fathered by Jack or Nick was inconclusive; Nick claimed paternity over Summer, wanting another daughter following Cassie's death. When Summer became involved with Jack's son Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer)—her possible half brother—Nick conducted another paternity DNA test. Sharon learned of this, and switched the results, to make everyone believe Nick wasn't Summer's father, {{so that she could}} comfort and win him back. A fight between Phyllis and Sharon (after Phyllis overheard Sharon confessing to switching the results) ended with Phyllis falling {{down a flight of stairs}} and into a coma. Speaking of these events Case stated: [...] "Sharon really does feel justified in what she <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>In</b> fact, she feels she is doing what needs to be done. [...] She feels that hers and Nick’s destinies, and Cassie’s destiny, and everyone’s life was compromised by Phyllis having this baby, because Nick and Phyllis had an affair, and Nick wanted to get back with Sharon." [...] Sharon then began plotting to win her [...] "high school sweetheart" [...] back from his fiancé, Phyllis's sister Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins), to no avail. It was revealed that Sharon was neglecting her bipolar disorder medication the whole time and eventually got her health back on track, but continued to debate whether or not she should tell Nick about Summer's true paternity.|$|E
