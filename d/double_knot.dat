25|$|T. H. Foley {{made the}} first medals from 1912 until they went out of {{business}} in 1915. The eagle pendant and scroll were of die struck bronze washed with silver. Early versions were made with a short <b>double</b> <b>knot</b> and later ones with a long <b>double</b> <b>knot.</b> Only 338 of these medals were issued, making them the rarest version. Some Foleys were issued with a drop ribbon– the ribbon was extended, folded through the bar mount on the scroll, then dropped behind the eagle pendant and cut in a swallowtail. The first drop ribbon style medal was issued to the fourth Eagle Scout– Sidney Clapp, a 31-year-old Scoutmaster from West Shokan, NY.|$|E
25|$|The late 1st century AD saw the {{introduction}} of the Kraftig Profilierte group of fibula designs. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae have a wide fan-, or bell-shaped head and a long thin pointy foot. They have long bilateral hinges. There are three main variations of the Kraftig Profilierte fibula. The North Pannonian <b>Double</b> <b>Knot</b> type, found in Pannonia has two knobs, or knots, on the bow. The Single Knot type, found in the central Balkans, has a single knob. The Black Sea type, found in the steppes north of the Black Sea, has a thin body, with no flaring near the head, and two knots. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae were found in the late 1st to late 2nd centuries AD and are mostly associated with the Przeworsk proto-Gothic culture.|$|E

500|$|Juliet is in bed after {{sleeping}} with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, {{and when she}} determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses {{to let her go}} home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the current date, September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of [...] "Left Behind". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's [...] "implant" [...] has been [...] "activated" [...] and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the drop point to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. While setting up her shelter, Juliet looks around the camp and ties a final <b>double</b> <b>knot</b> as Jack smiles at her.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{claimed by}} many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost {{perfectly}} intact, {{is considered by}} many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is weaved using the Armenian <b>double</b> <b>knot,</b> and the red filaments color was made from Armenian cochineal. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, [...] "From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship". Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. It {{is interesting to note that}} at the ruins of Persopolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>double</b> {{overhand}} <b>knot</b> {{is simply}} a logical extension of the regular overhand knot, made with one additional pass. The result is slightly larger {{and more difficult to}} untie. It forms {{the first part of the}} surgeon's knot and both sides of a <b>double</b> fisherman's <b>knot.</b> The strangle knot is a rearranged <b>double</b> overhand <b>knot</b> made around an object. It is sometimes used to secure items to posts. According to The Ashley Book of <b>Knots,</b> [...] "A <b>double</b> overhand <b>knot</b> tied in a cat-o'-nine-tails is termed a blood knot."

In fact, the curve is infinitely differentiable everywhere, as it must be if it exactly represents a circle.|$|R

6000|$|It {{was while}} we were busy with these tasks that some news arrived which was unpleasing enough to everyone, except perhaps to Henri Marais. I was engaged on a certain evening {{in trying to make}} sixteen of the Kaffir cattle pull {{together}} in the yoke, instead of tying themselves into a <b>double</b> <b>knot</b> and over-setting the wagon, when Hans, who was helping me, suddenly called out: ...|$|E

[...] "Look here, friend, I have some knowledge of poisons, and I swear to {{you that if you}} attempt it, you shall die within a week, tied in a <b>double</b> <b>knot,</b> and never know whence the dose came. Or I can bewitch you, I, who have not lived a dozen years among the Moors for nothing, so that your head swells and your body wastes, and you utter blasphemies, not knowing what you say, until for very shame's sake they toast you among the faggots also." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, as {{we started}} about ten {{o'clock in the}} morning and the veld was fairly level, I {{expected}} that we should reach this outspan by three or four in the afternoon, which would give me time to walk back before sunset. In fact, however, so many accidents happened of one sort or another, both to the wagon itself, of which the woodwork had shrunk with long standing in the sun, and to the cattle, which, being unused to the yoke, tied themselves in a <b>double</b> <b>knot</b> upon every opportunity, that we only arrived there at the approach of night.|$|E

60|$|There {{were several}} {{padlocked}} dispatch-boxes, and, {{on a shelf}} above, a bundle of folded papers. I took this bundle carefully out {{and laid it on}} the table before me.

6000|$|Oh! it was {{a glorious}} thing to see the fear-nothing, dare-anything fashion in which, when he saw how matters stood, Ben Bolt threw down his stick and bundle, drew his cutlass, and {{attacked}} the two bears at once, single-handed, crying [...] "Come on," [...] in a voice of thunder. And {{it was a}} satisfactory thing, to behold the way, in which he cut and slashed at their heads (the heads having been previously prepared for such treatment), and the agility he displayed in leaping over their backs and under their legs, and holding on by their tails, while they vainly endeavoured to catch him. The applause was frequent and prolonged, and the two Esquimaux prisoners rolled about their burly figures and laughed till the tears ran down their fat cheeks. But when Ben Bolt suddenly caught the two bears by their tails, tied them together in a <b>double</b> <b>knot,</b> and fled behind a hummock, which the Big Bear passed {{on one side and}} the little Bear on the other, and so, as a matter of course, stuck hard and fast, the laughter was excessive; and when the gallant British seaman again rushed forward, massacred the Big Bear with two terrific cuts, slew the Little Bear with one tremendous back-hander, and then sank down on one knee and pressed his hand to his brow as if he were exhausted, a cheer ran from stem to stern of the Dolphin, the like of which had not filled the hull of that good ship, since she was launched upon her ocean home! ...|$|E
60|$|XX. I have, however, {{given enough}} {{instances}} of vitality shown in mere daring, whether wise, as surely {{in this last}} instance, or inexpedient; but, as a single example of the Vitality of Assimilation, the faculty which turns to its purposes all material that is submitted to it, I would refer the reader to the extraordinary columns of the arcade {{on the south side}} of the Cathedral of Ferrara. A single arch of it is given in Plate XIII. on the right. Four such columns forming a group, there are interposed two pairs of columns, as seen on the left of the same plate; and then come another four arches. It is a long arcade of, I suppose, not less than forty arches, perhaps of many more; and in the grace and simplicity of its stilted Byzantine curves I hardly know its equal. Its like, in fancy of column, I certainly do not know; there being hardly two correspondent, and the architect having been ready, as it seems, to adopt ideas and resemblances from any sources whatsoever. The vegetation growing up the two columns is fine, though bizarre; the distorted pillars beside it suggest images of less agreeable character; the serpentine arrangements founded on the usual Byzantine <b>double</b> <b>knot</b> are generally graceful; but I was puzzled to account for the excessively ugly type of the pillar, fig. 3, one of a group of four. It so happened, fortunately for me, that there had been a fair in Ferrara; and, when I had finished my sketch of the pillar, I had to get out of the way of some merchants of miscellaneous wares, who were removing their stall. It had been shaded by an awning supported by poles, which, in order that the covering might be raised or lowered according to the height of the sun, were composed of two separate pieces, fitted to each other by a rack, in which I beheld the prototype of my ugly pillar. It will not be thought, after what I have above said of the inexpedience of imitating anything but natural form, that I advance this architect's practice as altogether exemplary; yet the humility is instructive, which condescended to such sources for motives of thought, the boldness, which could depart so far from all established types of form, and the life and feeling, which out of an assemblage of such quaint and uncouth materials, could produce an harmonious piece of ecclesiastical architecture.|$|E
