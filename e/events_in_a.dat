5|$|The Heritage Classic {{was played}} {{two months after}} the 2011 Winter Classic. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated the Winter Classic is {{designed}} for American television and to promote the game in the United States, but that the league sought to hold another game for its Canadian partners. He said the league delayed on hosting a second outdoor game until it felt it was capable of holding three significant <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-month span, including the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The Viceroy, {{trying to}} calm the criollos, gave {{his own version of}} <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proclamation. He asked for {{allegiance}} to King FerdinandVII, but popular unrest continued to intensify. He was aware of the news, but only said that the situation on the Iberian Peninsula was delicate; he did not confirm the fall of the Junta. His proposal was to make a government body that would rule on behalf of FerdinandVII, together with Viceroy of Peru José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Governor of Potosí Francisco de Paula Sanz and President of the Royal Audiencia of Charcas Vicente Nieto.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew to mutiny. These factors, however, were arguably the final <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men to mutiny but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging <b>events.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> toothache, nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two nations—the {{largest number}} of {{participating}} Winter Olympic countries to that point—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. The Soviet Union made its Winter Olympics debut and won more medals than any nation. Austrian Toni Sailer became {{the first person to}} sweep all three alpine skiing <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered.|$|E

5|$|Alex (Erin Yvette), a teenager, is on {{the last}} ferry heading to the fictional Edwards Island for a weekend party. She is {{accompanied}} by Ren (Aaron Kuban), her stoner friend, and Jonas (Gavin Hammon), her new stepbrother. On the island, Alex and company meet Clarissa (Avital Ash), Alex's late brother Michael's ex-girlfriend, and Nona (Brittani Johnson), Clarissa's best friend and Ren's love interest. Ren notes that the island's only permanent resident, Maggie Adler, has recently died. After camping on the beach, Alex, Ren, and Jonas explore the nearby caves, where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural <b>events.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> small cavern, Alex tunes her radio and unexpectedly forms a rift. A voice answers and the teens experience visions before passing out. Jonas and Alex awake in front of Harden Tower. Ren calls, having passed out in the woods, while Clarissa calls from the decommissioned military fort on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{events leading}} to the {{destruction}} of the royal palace did not cause the destruction of the whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda's successor, Akizzi, was ruling {{in the second half of}} the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten's reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did not mention the <b>events</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe that the author of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.|$|E

McIlroy entered the final round three strokes behind Louis Oosthuizen and defeated him by one stroke. The win also put McIlroy {{at the top of the}} PGA Tour money list. McIlroy's success continued the following week when he won the BMW Championship. He was 40-under par for his two playoff tournament victories.
