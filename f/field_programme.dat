50|$|Until 1995, the long-{{distance}} women's event was over 3000 metres. This was matched to the men's distance of 5000 m {{in line with}} changes in the Olympic programme. Though fewer events were initially on offer in the women's track and <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> for the French championships, this was gradually expanded, with the 1500 m being introduced in 1969, the 3000 m in 1972, the 400 m hurdles in 1976, the triple jump in 1990, the hammer throw in 1994, and the pole vault in 1995. The introduction of a women's 3000 m steeplechase in 2000 finally brought the men's and women's programmes to parity.|$|E

50|$|The {{highlight}} {{of her career}} came in the Chinese Games track and <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> in September. First, she ran a best of 31:10.46 minutes to place fourth in the women's 10,000 metres (won by Wang Junxia in a world record). Ma followed this with a run of 8:19.78 minutes in the heats of the 3000 metres. This time was faster than the world record for the event but left her in third place as Wang led again. In the final, Wang improved further to improve that mark, while Ma placed fourth {{in a time of}} 8:21.26 minutes, which ranked as the seventh fastest time ever and remains the fastest time recorded for such a low finish. Her last outing of the year, and the last major race of her career, came at the 1993 IAAF World Marathon Cup in November. There the Chinese women won with a perfect score by taking the top four spots, with Ma coming fourth in 2:30:44 hours.|$|E
40|$|The Smart <b>Fields</b> <b>programme</b> {{has been}} active in Shell over the last decade and has given large benefits. In order to {{understand}} the value and to underpin strategies for the future implementation programme, a study was carried out to quantify the benefits to date. This focused on actually achieved value, through increased production or lower costs. This provided an estimate of the total value achieved to date. Future benefits such as increased reserves or continued production gain were recorded separately. The paper describes the process followed in the benefits quantification. It identifies the key solutions and technologies and describes the mechanism used to understand the relation between solutions and value. Examples have been given of value from various assets around the world, in both existing fields and in green fields. Finally, the study provided the methodology for tracking of value. This helps Shell to estimate and track the benefits of the Smart <b>Fields</b> <b>programme</b> at company scale. ...|$|R

5000|$|Brian Perry has {{led many}} {{international}} research and development projects seeking {{a better understanding of}} the dynamics, control and impacts of tropical diseases of livestock; he has lived and worked in UK, Ethiopia, Colombia, Zambia, USA and Kenya, and has consulted widely in many countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. He started his international career in Ethiopia on the rinderpest control programme, undertaking surveys of disease of importance to Ethiopia’s livestock sector. He then moved to Colombia, investigating the diseases of impact to the Colombian sheep industry, particularly those affecting smallholder farmers in the Andean region. He then built a veterinary epidemiology <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> in Zambia, investigating the constraints to the traditional livestock sector, before taking up a position at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine in the USA in 1982, where he initiated the epidemiology teaching and research programme at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine in the USA in 1982. He went on to lead the epidemiology and socioeconomics research programmes at the International Laboratory for Research on Livestock Diseases (ILRAD) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) for 20 years, where he specialised in the integration of veterinary epidemiology and agricultural economics to assess the impacts of livestock diseases and their control in developing country settings,. Since leaving ILRI in 2007 he has made several analytical contributions on the role of livestock and disease control in pro-poor growth. He recently reviewed the current demands on global livestock research, and the performance of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in a White Paper. He {{has led many}} independent evaluations of public funding investments in agricultural development and health in different countries and regions of the world, including the Real Time Evaluation of the global programme against highly pathogenic avian influenza, run by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). [...] Brian Perry also contributes to the growth of African-led health research, providing mentorship for younger scientists and support for African capacity-building initiatives; he is chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of Afrique One, an African Research Consortium for Ecosystem and Population Health, funded by the Wellcome Trust.He is an author or co-author of some 250 scientific articles in refereed journals, books and proceedings.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the environmental learning {{of a group of}} senior geography students through a problem-based learning (PBL) <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> to see if the goals of education for the environment could be accomplished. In the PBL <b>field</b> <b>programme,</b> the students were given a problem statement concerning a real-life scenario of an old lady living in a remote village of Hong Kong. During the PBL <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> which also has adopted an action research framework, the students were observed to have identified the problem statement, set hypotheses, constructed the research methods and collected empirical data in an authentic environment all by themselves. This paper reports on the first cycle of this piece of action research. Data were collected both quantitatively and qualitatively via questionnaires, students' reflective journals, field observation notes and group interviews. The initial finding of this PBL <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> reveals that students had acquired more in-depth knowledge and extended their comfort zones in learning. They were able to develop and practice their critical thinking and problem-solving skills while they were working on the problem in the field. Although {{there was no evidence of}} sustained self-directed learning among the students, the PBL <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> offered them a framework for developing self-directed learning. An initial conclusion is that PBL in the field can provide a useful framework and direction for EE to accomplish the goals of education for the environment. ©. 2008 T. Kwan & M.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the environment of}} mainstream residential schools largely {{from the viewpoint of}} the pupils' perception. The nature of the physical environment and in particular the evolution of the built environment is discussed in detail. The temporal element is not forgotten in this context, as major influences, be they personalities or trends are assessed for their impact. The second major element of the environment is then considered, being the social climate. A whole range of factors are assessed for the level of impact in terms of their influence on the atmosphere of a residential school. The role of Government, and in particular the impact of the Children Act. (1989), is covered in detail. The range of areas where the legislation impinges on the form of the physical environment is discussed. Behaviorialism as an approach {{to the study of the}} perception of the environment is developed as a concept. The major trends in developing an approach to perceptual studies are traced and individual contributors are given due recognition. From this a <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> is created, drawing upon ideas employed in the past for the assessment of the environment. The <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> is applied to a variety of residential schools, which declare themselves to have a distinctive ethos. The <b>field</b> <b>programme</b> is completed by the pupils in the schools in order to assess their perception of the effectiveness of the school environment in their educational experience. Fifteen case studies are detailed to illustrate specific points of contrast between schools. The mean school for comparative purposes is calculated and recommendations for the improvement and development of the whole residential school environment are made...|$|E
