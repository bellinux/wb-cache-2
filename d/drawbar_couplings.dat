50|$|A {{trackless}} train — or tram (U.S. English), road train, land train, {{parking lot}} tram, Dotto train or Choo-Choo train — is a road-going articulated vehicle {{used for the}} transport of passengers, comprising a driving vehicle pulling one or more carriages connected by <b>drawbar</b> <b>couplings,</b> {{in the manner of}} a road-going railway train.Similar vehicles may be used for transport of freight or baggage for short distances, such as at a factory or airport.|$|E
50|$|As in {{a regular}} road vehicle, the tractor unit is steered through the front wheels by a {{steering}} wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or double axle. The following carriages are then steered through the <b>drawbar</b> <b>couplings</b> between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less side clearance while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber {{to mitigate the effect}} of acceleration or braking.|$|E
