40|$|Abstract—Some electroactive {{polymers}} show large electric-field-induced strain. However, it {{is difficult}} to characterize the transverse strain response, especially the dynamic response, under high driving electric fields. In this work, a transverse strain measurement system based on a ZYGO laser Doppler interferometer has been developed. This system can measure transverse strain responses of polymer actuators of different sizes over a wide displacement and frequency range. By using this system, we have investigated the electric-field-induced strains of electroactive polymer actuators fabricated from silicone (Dow Corning HSIII RTV) films. The static and dynamic strains of the actuators have been measured under various driving electric fields and mechanical loads. Our results show that the polymers exhibit a non-linear relationship between strain and driving field. Mechanical loads {{have a significant effect on}} transverse strain responses. Transverse strains of 3. 25 % (static) and 2. 08 % (dynamic at 1 Hz) have been obtained under a load-free condition. Our experimental results can be understood on the basis of hyperelastic theory.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to build a model of an <b>electroactive</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>actuator</b> when {{external}} electric field is applied. Materials whose rheological properties can be varied by electric excitation are called electroactive materials. The behavior of these rubberlike media is commonly investigated in two different ways. Brigadnov, Dorfmann, Bustamante, Ogden and others describe the coupled problem of finite deformation of the continua in electromagnetic field by taking into account all the electromagnetic phenomena. Pelrine, Kornbluh, Sommer-Larsen and others present a phenomenological description. Our aim is to form a bridge between these two points of view by neglecting those terms of the governing and transformation equations that are smaller than other contributions by several orders of magnitude. First, those equations are presented that govern the finite deformation and the electromagnetic phenomena inside the material. After that, those estimations will be taken that show the order of magnitude of the different contributions to the so-called effective fields. Finally, the model of the EAP actuator under periodically changing electric field will be presented. Because of the periodically changing finite deformation of the actuator, the electromagnetic phenomena must be investigated in the rest frames fixed to every single point of the material body. The electromagnetic field-variables can be converted into the laboratory frame by the slow speed approximation of the Lorentz transformation. For the special case of thin electroactive polymer actuators, one can find that the velocity dependent contributions are smaller by ten orders of magnitude in the electric field transformation, and by five orders of magnitude in the magnetic field transformation equations. On the other hand, none of the terms of the effective current can be neglected, because they can be of the same order of magnitude as the free current...|$|E

The topology of the mechanism resembles that of bistable mechanisms operating under the buckling effect. However, the mechanism proposed in this paper can have many stable positions depending on the input voltage.
