The simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows <b>ion</b> <b>flow</b> while reducing electrolyte mixing. To further minimize mixing of the electrolytes, a salt bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted U-tube. As the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit, the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|Bungarotoxin is a {{compound}} with known interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which constitute {{a family of}} ion channels whose activity is triggered by neurotransmitter binding. Bungarotoxin is produced {{in a number of}} different forms, though one of the commonly used forms is the long chain alpha form, α-bungarotoxin, which is isolated from the banded krait snake. Though extremely toxic if ingested, α-bungarotoxin has shown extensive usefulness in neuroscience as it is particularly adept at isolating nAChRs due to its high affinity to the receptors. As there are multiple forms of bungarotoxin, there are different forms of nAChRs to which they will bind, and α-bungarotoxin is particularly specific for α7-nAChR. This α7-nAChR functions to allow calcium ion influx into cells, and thus when blocked by ingested bungarotoxin will produce damaging effects, as ACh signaling will be inhibited. Likewise, the use of α-bungarotoxin can be very useful in neuroscience if it is desirable to block calcium flux in order to isolate effects of other channels. Additionally, different forms of bungarotoxin may be useful for studying inhibited nAChRs and their resultant calcium <b>ion</b> <b>flow</b> in different systems of the body. For example, α-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in the musculature and κ-bungarotoxin is specific for nAChRs found in neurons.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of ISEE 1 and 2 {{magnetopause}} crossings previously identified as times of quasi-steady reconnection, flows of medium energy ions in the magnetosheath are identified. The paper then investigates the particle pitch angle distribution immediately before and after each of these events for the signature of quasi-trapped distributions of energetic ions. Several of the <b>ion</b> <b>flows</b> identified were observed simultaneously with previously identified flux transfer events (FTEs). While FTEs identified from the magnetometer tracings typically show evidence of <b>ion</b> <b>flows,</b> the converse is not necessarily true. However, all properties of the magnetosheath <b>ion</b> <b>flows</b> are the same regardless of whether an FTE can be identified from the magnetometer data. Evidence is found for small-scale reconnection processes (FTEs, <b>ion</b> <b>flows)</b> embedded within a larger region of interconnected field, which is traced out by the quasi-trapped particles. Quasi-trapped distributions of medium-energy ions are seen to sandwich reconnection-associated <b>ion</b> <b>flows</b> in the magnetosheath.

Brown made the claim to observers and in the media that his experiments were showing anti-gravity effects. Brown would continue his work and produced a series of high-voltage devices in the following years in attempts to sell his ideas to aircraft companies and the military.

2500|$|Synaptic {{plasticity}} is {{the ability}} of a synapse between two neurons to change in strength over time. [...] Synaptic plasticity is caused by changes in use of the synaptic pathway, namely, the frequency of synaptic potentials and the receptors used to relay chemical signals. [...] Synaptic plasticity plays a large role in learning and memory in the brain. [...] Synaptic plasticity can occur through intrinsic mechanisms, in which changes in synapse strength occur because of its own activity, or through extrinsic mechanisms, in which the changes in synapse strength occur via other neural pathways. [...] Short-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity often occurs because of limited neurotransmitter supply at the synapse, and long-term inhibition can occur through decreased receptor expression in the postsynaptic cell. [...] Short-term complementary synaptic plasticity often occurs because of residual or increased <b>ion</b> <b>flow</b> in either the presynaptic or postsynaptic terminal, while long-term synaptic plasticity can occur through the increased production of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors, among others, in the postsynaptic cell.|$|E

The negative ions created downstream contributes to the upstream equilibrium as well as the upstream positive ions contribute to the downstream equilibrium.

50|$|Repolarization {{depends on}} the charges of <b>ions</b> and their <b>flow</b> across membranes. In {{skeletal}} muscle cells, repolarization is simple.

Once the action potential is over, potassium <b>ions</b> <b>flow</b> out of the cell due to increased cell membrane permeability to those ions.

This repolarization occurs quickly enough that another action potential can cause depolarization, even before the last action potential has dissipated. The cardiac muscle differs in {{that there are more}} calcium channels that counteract the potassium channels. While potassium quickly flows out of the cell, calcium slowly flows into the cell.
