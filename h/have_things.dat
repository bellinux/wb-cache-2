Disraeli did not <b>have</b> <b>things</b> all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the Cyprus Convention ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.|$|E

25|$|Linda Schele noted {{following}} the conference {{that this is}} like saying that the inscriptions of ancient Egypt—or the writings of Greek philosophers or historians—do not reveal anything important about their cultures.

25|$|Chaos erupts {{throughout}} {{the streets and}} Quintana is killed by a bull stampede. At the docks, Miller saves Feck from a bullet wound after handing over the Zephyr in a small pouch. Feck later reveals that the battery is unstable and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald. Miller collapses from the gunshot and is hospitalized in Washington D.C.. George apologizes to Miller about him and Fitzgerald, but tells him {{to let go of}} Havens and return to the C.I.A. Miller is later drugged by a nurse, who turns out to be Havens. After Havens breaks Miller out of the hospital, he wakes up in the rebuilt GTO that belonged to her father. After Miller asks what day it is, Havens kisses him and says it is someday. This is a reference {{from the start of the}} film that they both <b>have</b> <b>things</b> they want to do someday, and Havens begins to drive towards Cape Horn. As the credits begin to roll, Miller's parents unwittingly receive tickets to Cape Horn in the mail and accept to go.|$|E
500|$|I didn't want to {{make the}} movie 3D because when you <b>have</b> <b>things</b> that big… the thing that happens naturally, you're looking at two {{buildings}} lets say at 300 feet , if you move there is no parallax. They're so big that, in 3D, you barely notice anything no matter how fast you move… To force the 3D effects for robots and monsters that are supposed to be big you are making their [...] miniaturized, making them human scale.|$|E

An Iranian police official, citing concerns about possible looting, said all movement {{into and out}} of damaged houses would require prior approval from the governor's office, the police, and the Unexpected Events Committee on the island. UNICEF offered assistance to Iran, and the official in charge of response stated: [...] "we are preparing to respond if needed". They elaborated that the Iranian authorities [...] "appeared to <b>have</b> <b>things</b> under control".|$|E
500|$|Another major {{component}} of Bo’s Chongqing model concerned the city’s economic policies. Just {{as he had done}} in Liaoning province, Bo ambitiously pursued foreign investment in the city, lowered corporate income tax rates (15% compared to the 25% national average), and sought to stimulate rapid urbanization and industrialization. He also carried on with policies initiated by his predecessors which focused on domestic consumption, rather than export-led growth. The Chongqing model also placed emphasis on the importance of state-owned enterprises; in 2010, Bo stressed that China [...] " [...] to <b>have</b> <b>things</b> that are state-owned." ...|$|E
500|$|Assistant Postmaster General Frank H. Hitchcock {{resigned}} {{from his office}} in February 1908 to lead the Taft effort. In April, Taft made a speaking tour, traveling as far west as Omaha before being recalled to go to Panama and straighten out a contested election. At the 1908 Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, there was no serious opposition to him, and he gained a first-ballot victory. Yet Taft did not <b>have</b> <b>things</b> his own way: he had hoped his running mate would be a midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead [...] the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York, a conservative. [...] Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign.|$|E

500|$|The move to Los Angeles {{also meant}} a drastic price {{increase}} for the series. Bruce Harwood, who played Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers noted, [...] "At the time, {{the exchange rate}} between Canadian and U.S. dollars was pretty dramatic. Somebody {{told me that the}} cost per episode doubled, even tripled, once they moved". In addition, the move further reduced the amount of expensive special effects the series was able to produce. Writer Vince Gilligan explained [...] "everything in Los Angeles is more expensive across the board. [...] It became apparent very quickly to me that we were no longer going to <b>have</b> <b>things</b> such as nuclear submarines descending through the ice and trains exploding {{in the middle of the}} woods".|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} started {{performing}} at higher profile gigs {{such as the}} Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, [...] "We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to <b>have</b> <b>things</b> thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed." [...] The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were {{often referred to as}} Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated as SS2K).|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Frank and {{incoming}} House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{were accused}} by Rep. John Hostettler (R-IN) {{of having a}} [...] "radical homosexual agenda"; Frank responded [...] "I do <b>have</b> <b>things</b> I {{would like to see}} adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the right to marry the individual of our choice; the right to serve in the military to defend our country; and the right to a job based solely on our own qualifications. I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting radical in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring revolutionary platform." [...] Frank's stance on outing gay Republicans has been called the [...] "Frank Rule" [...] whereby a closeted person who uses her or his power, position, or notoriety to hurt LGBT people can be outed. The issue became relevant during the Mark Foley scandal of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher: [...] "I think there's a right to privacy. But the right to privacy should not be a right to hypocrisy. And people who want to demonize other people shouldn't then be able to go home and close the door and do it themselves." ...|$|E

500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all <b>have</b> <b>things</b> to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E
500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you <b>have</b> <b>things</b> that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

2500|$|The {{symbol of}} the [...] "anti-Orange protest" [...] was an orange snake strangled in a fist. The motto of the protest was [...] "Нам есть, что терять!"

2500|$|Though genre {{paintings}} provide many {{insights into}} the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted. [...] Many which seemed only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message – the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to <b>have</b> <b>things</b> both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation – the works of Jan Steen, whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.|$|E
