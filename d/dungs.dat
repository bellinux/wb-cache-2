40|$|<b>Dung</b> beetles highly {{depend on}} the ephemeral {{microhabitat}} <b>dung</b> which is food resource and larval habitat at the same time. Environmental conditions surrounding a <b>dung</b> pad, such as vegetation structure, {{have an impact on}} <b>dung</b> beetle assemblages. We investigated the influence of <b>dung</b> conditions and surrounding habitat characteristics on Mediterranean <b>dung</b> beetle assemblages in a permanently grazed landscape in northern Sardinia. We sampled the <b>dung</b> beetle assemblages of donkey and horse <b>dung</b> in three different vegetation types and assessed species richness and abundance of <b>dung</b> beetles. Species richness was determined by <b>dung</b> and surrounding habitat conditions, whereas abundance was solely affected by <b>dung</b> conditions. However, species richness and abundance decreased with increasing <b>dung</b> density. The effect of <b>dung</b> density on species richness varied depending on vegetation type, with dry grassland exhibiting the highest number of <b>dung</b> beetles species at high <b>dung</b> density. Species composition in <b>dung</b> pads was influenced by abiotic factors with dwellers being negatively affected by increasing dung-pad temperature. Our results underline the importance of diverse vegetation, particularly with respect to the complexity of vegetation which interrelates with the microclimate. Furthermore, our findings illustrate the negative effect of high <b>dung</b> densities on <b>dung</b> beetle assemblages, suggesting that the degree of the intensity of use by grazing animals is important when considering measures for the conservation of <b>dung</b> beetles...|$|R

In {{this study we}} provide data on the abundance and richness of <b>dung</b> beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae) {{attracted to}} sheep <b>dung</b> in exotic pastures (Brachiaria spp.). In four areas of exotic pasture pitfall traps were installed and baited with fresh sheep <b>dung</b> for sampling of <b>dung</b> beetles. A total of 2, 290 individuals were captured belonging to 16 species, 10 genera and five tribes of Scarabaeinae beetles. Trichillum externepunctatum Preudhomme de Borre, 1886 and Dichotomius bos (Blanchard, 1843) were dominant. The guild of dwellers was the most abundant in pastures. We demonstrate that <b>dung</b> beetles are attracted to sheep <b>dung.</b> Since the production of both cattle and sheep {{in the same area}} is common in tropical pasturelands, results obtained here highlight the need to investigate the actual role of <b>dung</b> sharing (cattle <b>dung</b> + sheep <b>dung)</b> by <b>dung</b> beetles.

40|$|<b>Dung</b> beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) have a {{significant}} role in regulating the ecosystem services they provide on rangelands. Colonization of <b>dung</b> piles by <b>dung</b> beetles can help facilitate the decomposition of <b>dung,</b> control dung-breeding pests, and cycle important nutrients into the soil to improve pasture quality. Cattle are grazed on pastures at various stocking densities {{depending on the type of}} grazing practice. The influence of grazing practices on <b>dung</b> beetle communities and services remains largely unknown. Our first study investigated <b>dung</b> beetle activity across different cattle grazing practices to determine how grazing might influence <b>dung</b> beetle abundance and diversity. <b>Dung</b> beetle populations were monitored throughout the grazing season on pastures that were grazed under various practices: non-grazed/hay, continuous grazing, low-stocking rotational grazing, and high-stocking (mob) rotational grazing. Results from this study showed significantly higher <b>dung</b> beetle diversity on pastures exposed to rotational grazing practices compared to continuous grazing or no grazing. In some cases, <b>dung</b> beetle abundance and species richness were significantly greater on pastures that were grazed through high-stocking rotational grazing compared to low-stocking rotational or continuous grazing treatments. Based on these data, rotational cattle grazing may favor the colonization of <b>dung</b> beetles on rangeland, regardless of stocking density. Our second study investigated whether <b>dung</b> beetles exhibit preferences for <b>dung</b> from cattle exposed to different grazing practices. <b>Dung</b> from cattle in three separate grazing practices were used to test <b>dung</b> beetle preference: continuous grazing, low-stocking rotational grazing, and high-stocking rotational grazing. <b>Dung</b> beetle abundance was measured as well as the nutrient and physical properties of each <b>dung</b> type. Results of the study revealed no significant differences in <b>dung</b> beetle abundance between <b>dung</b> collected from each grazing practice. Nutritional content, pH, moisture, and dry matter levels also were not significantly different. However, the results indicated varying <b>dung</b> beetle species composition on <b>dung</b> from the continuous versus rotational grazing practices. Overall, cattle grazing practices may not affect <b>dung</b> composition or its influence on <b>dung</b> beetle preferences. Advisors: Jeffrey Bradshaw and Thomas Weisslin...|$|R
40|$|Management {{practice}} can have {{impacts on the}} abundance and frequency of <b>dung</b> beetle populations and nutrient cycling in grazing systems. Also, agriculture and livestock production land use is a considerable source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which {{are known to be}} one of the causes of global climate change. In this study, we evaluated the effect of <b>dung</b> beetle presence on the fluxes of greenhouse gasses (GHG’s) from <b>dung</b> pats in the semi-arid Sandhills region of Nebraska, by using closed chambers to measure the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from <b>dung</b> pats that were exposed and unexposed to <b>dung</b> beetles. We also quantified the effects of <b>dung</b> beetle activity on the timing and magnitude of decomposition of <b>dung,</b> and subsequent fluxes of <b>dung</b> derived C and N into soil. We measured indicators of <b>dung</b> pat decomposition, <b>dung</b> pat C, N, and P variables, and soil C, N, and P variables below <b>dung</b> pats that were either exposed or unexposed to <b>dung</b> beetles. Higher fluxes of GHG’s from <b>dung</b> pats were observed. However, while higher fluxes of CO 2 and N 2 O, and lower fluxes of CH 4 due to <b>dung</b> pat exposure to <b>dung</b> beetles were observed, these effects were only significant in one experiment out of the four seasonal experiments performed. We also found that <b>dung</b> pat exposure to <b>dung</b> beetles can increase rates of mass loss in field moist <b>dung</b> pats, as well as rates of moisture loss. While higher concentrations of nutrients from <b>dung</b> pats in soil were observed, <b>dung</b> beetles had a minimal impact on the soil nutrient concentrations below decomposing <b>dung</b> pats. Environmental factors overall were much more impactful, and <b>dung</b> and soil nutrients, as well as GHG emissions, responded in accordance with temporal fluctuations in the environmental variables that were measured. Our study suggests that management considerations in regards to GHG emissions and nutrient cycling within subirrigated meadows of the Sandhills, might not need to offer as much concern to the effects of <b>dung</b> beetles as perhaps previously believed.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} land use change on {{biodiversity}} and ecosystem functions are variable, particularly in fragmented tropical rainforest systems with high diversity. <b>Dung</b> beetles (Scarabaeinae) are an ideal group to investigate the relationship between land use change, diversity and ecosystem function as they are easily surveyed, sensitive to habitat modification and perform many ecosystem functions. Although this relationship has been investigated for <b>dung</b> beetles in some tropical regions, {{there has been no}} study assessing how native <b>dung</b> beetles in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s tropical rainforests respond to deforestation, and what the corresponding consequences are for <b>dung</b> removal (a key ecosystem function fulfilled by <b>dung</b> beetles). In this study we investigated the relationship between <b>dung</b> beetle community attributes (determined through trapping) and function (using <b>dung</b> removal experiments that allowed different <b>dung</b> beetle functional groups to access the <b>dung)</b> in rainforest and cleared pasture in a tropical landscape in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Wet Tropics. Species richness, abundance and biomass were higher in rainforest compared to adjacent pasture, and species composition between these land use types differed significantly. However, average body size and evenness in body size were higher in pasture than in rainforest. <b>Dung</b> removal was higher in rainforest than in pasture when both functional groups or tunnelers only could access the <b>dung.</b> Increased <b>dung</b> removal in the rainforest was explained by higher biodiversity and dominance of a small number of species with distinct body sizes, as <b>dung</b> removal was best predicted by the evenness in body size of the community. Our findings suggest that functional traits (including body size and <b>dung</b> relocation behaviour) present in a <b>dung</b> beetle community are key drivers of <b>dung</b> removal. Overall, our results show that deforestation has reduced native <b>dung</b> beetle diversity in Australian tropical landscapes, which negatively impacts on the capacity for <b>dung</b> removal by <b>dung</b> beetles in this region...|$|R
