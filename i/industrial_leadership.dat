5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire. The Prussian landed elites, the Junkers, retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state. The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power {{to the absence of}} a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes, or by peasants in combination with the urban workers, in 1848 and again in 1871. Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group. This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> (the latter particularly important in the Rhineland) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire.|$|E
5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E

60|$|The wife of {{this ideal}} home may {{probably}} have a certain distaste for vicarious labour, that {{so far as the}} immediate minimum of duties goes will probably carry her through them. There will be few servants obtainable for the small homes of the future, and that may strengthen her sentiments. Hardly any woman seems to object to a system of things which provides that another woman should be made rough-handed and kept rough-minded for her sake, but with the enormous diffusion of levelling information that is going on, a perfectly valid objection will probably come from the other side in this transaction. The servants of the past and the only good servants of to-day are the children of servants or the children of the old labour base of the social pyramid, until recently a necessary and self-respecting element in the State. Machinery has smashed that base and scattered its fragments; the tradition of self-respecting inferiority is being utterly destroyed in the world. The contingents of the Abyss, even, will not supply daughters for this purpose. In the community of the United States no native-born race of white servants has appeared, and the emancipated young negress degenerates towards the impossible--which {{is one of the many}} stimulants to small ingenuities that may help very powerfully to give that nation the <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership</b> of the world. The servant of the future, if indeed she should still linger in the small household, will be a person alive to a social injustice and the unsuccessful rival of the wife. Such servants as wealth will retain will be about as really loyal and servile as hotel waiters, and on the same terms. For the middling sort of people in the future maintaining a separate ménage there is nothing for it but the practically automatic house or flat, supplemented, perhaps, by the restaurant or the hotel.|$|E
6000|$|As a {{distinctive}} thing British labour does not think. [...] "Class-conscious labour," [...] as the Marxists put it, scarcely exists in Britain. The only convincing case I ever met was a bath-chairman of literary habits Eastbourne. The {{only people who}} are, as a class, class-conscious in the British community are the Anglican gentry and their fringe of the genteel. Everybody else is [...] "respectable." [...] The mass of British workers find their thinking in the ordinary halfpenny papers or in John Bull. The so-called labour papers are perhaps less representative of British Labour than any other section of the press; the Labour Leader, for example, is the organ of such people as Bertrand Russell, Vernon Lee, Morel, academic rentiers who know {{about as much as}} of the labour side of industrialism as they do of cock-fighting. All the British peoples are racially willing and good-tempered people, quite ready to be led by those they imagine to be abler than themselves. They make the most cheerful and generous soldiers in the whole world, without insisting upon that democratic respect which the Frenchman exacts. They do not criticise and they do not trouble themselves much about the general plan of operations, so long as they have confidence in the quality and good will of their leading. But British soldiers will of their loading. But British soldiers will hiss a general when they think he is selfish, unfeeling, or a muff. And the socialist propaganda has imported ideas of public service into private employment. Labour in Britain has been growing increasingly impatient of bad or selfish <b>industrial</b> <b>leadership.</b> Labour trouble in Great Britain turns wholly upon the idea crystallised in the one word [...] "profiteer." [...] Legislation and regulation of hours of labour, high wages, nothing will keep labour quiet in Great Britain if labour thinks it is being exploited for private gain.|$|E

40|$|The modal part of road {{transport}} still accounts in France for approximately 80 % among all available transport modes. Even if {{a shift to}} other modes of transport is wished for, this situation {{is not likely to}} change radically in the next coming years. Indeed, the road network has developed over thousands of years: emerging from the track to the paved road, then to the smooth road and on to the continuous road. However, the environmental cost of current road infrastructures is still too important. As a consequence, the development of road infrastructures is not a priority anymore {{and as a matter of}} fact excluded from ambitious greening politics. There is then a need of strong innovation in this sector to solve these issues. The 5 th Generation Road program (R 5 G for French “Route de 5 ème Génération”) aims at changing the image of road infrastructures by designing, constructing and operating full scale demonstrators, which implement innovative solutions, ready for testing in research centres. To consider all aspects of this issue, the program is elaborated though a systemic approach and is organized around four emblematic conceptual elements: the adaptable road, the automated road, the resilient road and the acceptable road. The potential benefits of such a program are numerous: Maintaining the RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety) of road networks at existing levels, reinforcing <b>industrial</b> <b>leaderships</b> and targeting societal objectives (education, employment, and environment).

40|$|During {{the postwar}} period, {{internal}} tensions plagued the Australian labour movement. Central to these tensions were {{the formation and}} policies of the Industrial Groups. While their original aim was to destroy Communist influence in unions, the Groups rapidly established themselves as a power within the Labor Party. With the goal of consolidating their position, the Groups sought to obtain legislation which would further expand their influence. In New South Wales, this legislation {{took the form of}} general compulsory unionism. The aim was to strengthen those unions with <b>Industrial</b> Group <b>leadership,</b> thereby increasing their influence at Labor Party conferences. Despite strong left-wing opposition, the legislation was introduced in November 1953. This paper traces the New South Wales legislation from the time of its enactment to its ultimate demise.

As a result, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on such things as personality characteristics, traits, styles, and desired leader behaviors. To a lesser extent, there has been some emphasis on skills or competencies that leaders ought to have, principally organizing and facilitating skills. These skills reflect an understanding of leadership as good management, the <b>industrial</b> paradigm of <b>leadership.</b> In contrast, Hoskings and Morley (1988), who take a different, more modern approach to the subject of skills and leadership suggest that decision- and policy-making skills are those that leaders need most.
