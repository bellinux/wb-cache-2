5|$|The band {{were well}} known for their strong stage act, and had privately {{recorded}} several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not {{particularly interested in the}} album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E

25|$|Kritiks: The {{negative}} {{can claim}} that the affirmative is guilty of a certain mindset or assumption that should be grounds for rejection or a different mutually exclusive alternative to the Affirmatives plan. Kritiks are sometimes a reason to reject the entire affirmative advocacy without evaluating its policy; other times, kritiks can be evaluated within the same framework for evaluation as the affirmative case. Examples of some areas of literature for kritiks include biopower, racism, centralized government, and anthropocentrism. Kritiks arose in the early 1990s, with the first kritiks based in deconstructionist philosophy about the intrinsic ambiguity of language and were championed by debaters Shane Stafford and Bill Shanahan. Kritiks today have evolved to sometimes include the affirmative advocacy within their alternatives. These kritiks argue that the ontological or epistemological assumptions behind the affirmative are flawed {{and ought to be}} rejected, but the plan itself is fine. For example, an affirmative could argue that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to reduce our nuclear stockpile to avoid global proliferation out of fear of rogue states acquiring nuclear weapons. The negative could respond with an aff-inclusive kritik that argues that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to reduce our nuclear stockpile because nuclear weapons are unethical, but that we ought not conceptualize other states as fundamentally dangerous.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001, Chara {{released}} {{music as}} the drummer of the twin-drum all-girl rock band, Mean Machine, alongside Yuki, Swallowtail actress Ayumi Ito, 1980s musician Mayumi Chiwaki and former funk/rock band Jagatara dancer Yukarie. The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara {{that she thought}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members {{would have to do}} something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E
25|$|Kommotion was a teen-oriented daily TV {{pop music}} show, which had premiered in December 1964 on ATV-0, later Channel Ten. It {{included}} local performers miming {{to the latest}} overseas hits and artists showcasing their own material. In August 1966 its then-producer, David Joseph, was fired {{and most of the}} cast walked out in support. Al Maricic replaced Joseph and Meldrum reported the change-over for Go-Set. Maricic asked Meldrum to join the show: originally he declined but was convinced otherwise by Frazer, who reasoned that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for their circulation. Episodes of Kommotion were directed by Rob Weekes.|$|E

Although the law would make street hail of livery cabs legal, it was not welcomed by some of the livery cab drivers and politicians due to the fear that the cost would be too expensive as seen in the yellow taxi medallions which are sold through auctions with an average of $700,000 each. The Taxi and Limousine Commission clarified that the boro taxi permit would cost $1,500 and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for three years.|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} of Charles and Ana√Øs Lenglen, Suzanne Lenglen {{was born in}} Paris. During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, {{the owner of a}} carriage company, decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. The young girl enjoyed the game, and her father decided to train her further in the sport. His training methods included an exercise where, the story goes, he would lay down a handkerchief at various places on the court, to which his daughter had to direct the ball.|$|E
25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for princes to be persuaded that their {{people have the right to}} resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E

25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam and look at and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E

He was already working with Robin Herd, Alan Rees and Graham Coaker to establish the racing car manufacturer March Engineering where he handled legal and commercial matters. The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley. Like the other founders, Mosley put in ¬£2,500 of capital.

[...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people."

500|$|After signing to DGC Records, Nirvana began {{recording}} {{its second}} album Nevermind in May 1991. [...] "In Bloom" [...] {{was one of}} the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California; Vig thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to start recording a song previously recorded at Smart Studios. The arrangements for [...] "In Bloom" [...] and the other songs previously recorded with Vig in 1990 were largely unchanged; the recently hired drummer Dave Grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor Chad Channing had recorded, but added more power and precision to the recording. Cobain sang progressively [...] "harder" [...] during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the input level [...] "on the fly" [...] and hoped that Cobain would not [...] "change the phrasing or do something different" [...] while recording.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1934, Hammond filed [...] for an [...] "electrical musical instrument", {{which was}} {{personally}} {{delivered to the}} patent office by Hanert, explaining that they could start production immediately and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> for local employment in Chicago. The invention was unveiled {{to the public in}} April 1935, and the first model, the Model A, was made available in June of that year. Over 1,750 churches purchased a Hammond organ in {{the first three years of}} manufacturing, and by the end of the 1930s, over 200 instruments were being made each month. For all its subsequent success with professional musicians, the original company did not target its products at that market, principally because Hammond did not think [...] enough money was [...] in it. The Hammond Organ Company produced an estimated two million instruments in its lifetime; these have been described as [...] "probably the most successful electronic organs ever made". In 1966, an estimated 50,000 churches had installed a Hammond.|$|E
500|$|After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg {{stayed in}} touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour {{together}} in 1992, the lead singer thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> to have a choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group how to communicate their ideas {{all the way to}} the last rows of a venue. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as [...] "a bit of a joke". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form.|$|E
