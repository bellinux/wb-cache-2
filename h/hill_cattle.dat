50|$|Kalkarindji and {{the nearby}} {{settlement}} of Daguragu are the population centres of the land formerly held under the Wave <b>Hill</b> <b>Cattle</b> Station. In 1966, the indigenous station workers, led by Vincent Lingiari, staged a walk-off in protest against oppressive labour practices; following this, much of the land was returned to the Gurindji people by UK-based station owners The Vestey Group and the Australian Government in 1975.|$|E

5000|$|The Northern Land Council (NLC) {{is in the}} Top End of the Northern Territory of Australia.

50|$|In 1966 Vincent Lingiari led a {{walk off}} of the Gurindji people at the Wave <b>Hill</b> <b>cattle</b> station, 600 km south of Darwin, in protest over wages and {{conditions}} which were then a fraction of their non-indigenous counterparts. Although occupied by the international food company Vestey Brothers, the station was on the traditional land of the Gurindji people. The strikers initially camped on the Victoria River, but the following year moved to Wattie Creek, traditionally called Daguragu by the Gurindji, and changed their demand to one of return of their traditional lands.|$|E

Some time afterwards, he moved from the family farm and bought his own farm at Onslow. <b>Hill</b> raised <b>cattle</b> and horses and was also {{involved}} {{in the sale of}} lumber. In 1911, he was named to the province's Legislative Council.|$|R
5000|$|In about 1830, at or {{shortly before}} the Kingston Enclosures, a farm labourers cottage and barn was built.

5000|$|Vincent Lingiari AM (1919 - 21 January 1988), was an Aboriginal rights activist. Lingiari was {{a member}} of the Gurindji people. In his earlier life he worked as a {{stockman}} at Wave <b>Hill</b> <b>Cattle</b> Station. He also played the didgeridoo. Vincent was elected and became the leader of the Gurindji communities in August 1966. On 7 June 1976, Lingiari was named a Member of the Order of Australia for his services to the Aboriginal people. The story of Vincent Lingiari was celebrated in the song [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow".|$|E
50|$|Indigenous Australians had {{struggled}} for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the strike and walk {{off by the}} Gurindji people at Wave <b>Hill</b> <b>Cattle</b> Station in 1966. The Commonwealth Government of Gough Whitlam set up the Woodward Royal Commission in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. Justice Woodward's first report in July 1973 recommended that a Central Land Council and a Northern Land Council be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to {{the report of the}} Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.|$|E
50|$|Wave <b>Hill</b> <b>Cattle</b> Station {{is located}} {{approximately}} 600 km south of Darwin in the Northern Territory. From {{the late nineteenth}} century it was run by the British pastoral company, Vesteys. Vesteys employed the local Indigenous people, the Gurindji, to work on Wave Hill. But working conditions were extremely poor and wages were very low when compared to those of non Indigenous employees. In 1966, Lingiari, a member of the Gurindji had worked at Wave Hill, and recently returned from a period of hospitalisation in Darwin, led a walk-off of indigenous employees of Wave Hill as a protest against the work and conditions. While there had been complaints from Indigenous employees about conditions on Wave Hill over many years, including an inquiry during the 1930s that was critical of Vestey's employment practices, the walk-off had a focus that was aimed at a wider target than Vestey's. Before 1968 it was illegal to pay an indigenous worker more than a specified amount in goods and money. In many cases, the government benefits for which Indigenous employees were eligible were paid into pastoral companies’ accounts, rather than to the individuals.|$|E
50|$|In 1852, at Jäckel's instigation, Carl Gottlieb Kliemann from Pfaffendorf {{established}} the first, small inn on the <b>hill</b> in a <b>cattle</b> stall. Kliemann also blazed the first trails to various viewing points and notable rock formations.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} with an objective of establishing a relationship between various routine semen evaluation parameters. Work was conducted at Sperm Station Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, on the semen from five Jersey X local <b>hill</b> <b>cattle</b> crossbred breeding bulls.

The results of the study revealed a highly significant (P< 0. 01) correlation between the various semen evaluation parameters except for the gross morphological abnormalities where there was a significant (P< 0. 05) negative correlation between the acrosomal integrity and gross morphological abnormalities...|$|E
