2500|$|To {{support this}} hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the {{disconnect}} between spawning stock biomass and {{the recruitment of}} numerous fish species. One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like phytoplankton or zooplankton, which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing. In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the Peruvian anchovy fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s. [...] Officials and researchers from the Peruvian government and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the fishery. This explanation seemed to explain the diminished population trends of similar species from other regions, including the Pacific and <b>Japanese</b> <b>sardines</b> and the Atlanto-Scandian herring.|$|R

During the 1980s, migratory <b>Japanese</b> <b>sardine</b> {{was one of the}} most abundant fish in the summer and the main pinnipeds were a significant object of harvest for the indigenous populations of the Kuril islands, both for food and materials such as skin and bone. The long term fluctuations in the range and distribution of human settlements along the Kuril island presumably tracked the pinniped ranges. In historical times, fur seals were heavily exploited for their fur in the 19th and early 20th centuries and several of the largest reproductive rookeries, as on Raykoke island, were extirpated. In contrast, commercial harvest of the true seals and Steller sea lions has been relatively insignificant on the Kuril islands proper. Since the 1960s there has been essentially no additional harvest and the pinniped populations in the Kuril islands appear to be fairly healthy and in some cases expanding. The notable exception is the now extinct Japanese sea lion which was known to occasionally haul out on the Kuril islands.|$|E

These synchronous changes in populations seem to be associated with the weakening of the Aleutian Low Pressure in the North Pacific and weakening of the Oyashio Current in winter, and a sea surface temperature (SST) rise in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region in spring. The contrasting responses of the fish populations to the SST rise can be explained by different temperature preference in terms of growth rate in larval and early juvenile stages; cool temperatures are preferred by sardine and warm temperatures are preferred by saury and anchovy...|$|E

Patterns of correlations among trace element concentrations in sardines, such as the alkaline earth elements, period 4 elements, period 6 elements and toxic elements (As, Cd, Hg and Pb) were different between JS and PS. It was reported that the highest consumption of Sr for industries is in Japan. On the other hand, As in the environment is mainly associated with natural sources. Therefore, anthropogenic impacts and/or natural inputs affect trace element concentrations in sardines, in addition to their physicochemical properties such as radius and electron shell of these elements...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify fish with high binding activity to IgE in sera from Japanese fish-hypersensitive individuals. Methods: 38 children with a history of at least one episode of hypersensitivity after ingestion of fish were enrolled and 34 children with no history of reactions and negative IgE results for at least five kinds of fish antigen were included as controls. Using a radioallergosorbent test, we examined IgE-binding to each fish species using sera from fish-hypersensitive subjects. Fish were then graded according to IgE-binding activity. Results: Many fish species, including red salmon, silver salmon, yellowfin tuna, big eyed tuna, Atlantic tuna, saurel, skipper, yellowtail, <b>Japanese</b> <b>sardine,</b> bonita and mackerel had high IgE-binding activity. All of these fish are abundantly consumed in Japan. The hypersensitivity reactions experienced by many subjects occurred after ingestion of species with high IgE-binding activity. Only halibut (Osteichthyes) and sharks (Chondrichthyes) had low IgE-binding activity. Conclusions: A correlation was observed between IgE levels and expression of symptoms after fish ingestion. High consumption of salmon, tuna, scad (including saurel), skipper, yellowtail, sardine, bonita and mackerel in Japan might be the cause of the high IgE-binding activity of these species.

But {{towards the end of the}} season it appeared to increase at an increasing rate. The von Bertalanffy equation was litted to the former part, the growth curve so obtained was extrapolated to the latter part of the season also, and the observed and expected mean lengths were compared. It was seen that the differences in the rate of change of the monthly mean lengths between years were statistically non-significant. The asymptotic maximum lengths of the two sardines, estimated on the basis of the growth data of the first 6 - 7 months of life are considerably less than the modal sizes attained by them at the end of the first year of life, indicating that a change in growth rate has to take place if these modal sizes are to be attained. This expectation is suppo-rted by the observation that the mean lengths towards the end of the Palk Bay season are larger than those expected on the basis of the growth data of the earlier months and indicate the start of an exponential phase of growth. Hence there appears to be a perio-dicity in the growth of these young fishes, comparable to what is observed in temperate water fishes.

The eastern region has only the latter mode. 2 groups in one type can be recognized which have the remarkably different spawning temperatures among the former. This fact means to be a genotype, doesn't it? 3. AP type and AD type appear in April and May as a smaller shape in the southern region. This smaller shape comes up north and becomes larger and appears in July in the eastern region. The resources of A type will be derived from the spawning in the southern region. 4.

40|$|Seafood {{has always}} been a {{significant}} part of the Japanese diet and today accounts for about 40 % of the protein consumed by Japanese people. Domestic marine fisheries are generally divided into coastal fisheries, offshore fisheries, and distant-water fisheries (Table 9). From 1972 to 1988, Japan had the world’s largest fisheries. Catches increased through to 1984 with the maximum production of 12, 820, 000 t. The total catch of all marine species declined from the maximum in 1984 to 3, 734, 209 t in 2000 (Fig. 17). This was a change from 16. 0 % of the world’s catch in 1984, to 5. 1 % in 2000. In recent years, the fishery in China reportedly exceeds Japanese production. At present, Japan is the largest importer of fish products in the world. Approximately one third of the world catch in weight is exported, and Japan imports about 15 % in weight, or one quarter in value, of all exported fish products. The decline in catch in recent years (Fig. 17) is related to the natural decline in <b>Japanese</b> <b>sardine</b> abundance in the 1990 s and the reduced catches in distant-water fisheries (Table 9, Fig. 18). Climate and Ocean Influences A major influence on the production of fish in the Japanese coastal and offshore fisheries is the structure and dynamics of the subarctic current, the Oyashio, the subtropical currents, the Kuroshio and Tsushima, and the transition area between the Oyashio and Kuroshio (Fig. 19). The changes in currents affect vertical mixing, which alters the supply of nutrients to the surface production zone, as well as migration and larvae transportation. Changes in nutrient supply affect primary production which, in turn, changes the abundance and species of zooplankton which are the principal food of fishes. Mechanistic linkages between climate and physical oceanographic changes and stock productivity generally occur through bottom-up scenarios. In the Oyashio area, the major feeding grounds of sardine, chub mackerel, saury, common squid, and many other species, zooplankton density since the 1970 s has been negatively correlated with sardine biomass; other processes controlling the sardine population may be occurring (Taniguchi, 1999).

A negative correlation between the abundance of pelagic fishes(e. g. jack mackerel) in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region and the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region was attributed to the climatic modulation of larval transport and recruitment, which depends on the wintermonsoon-induced drift, current systems, and spawning season and site. The changes in abundance andalternation of dominant fish populations in the two regions in the 1930 s, 1970 s, and late 1980 s mirrored changesin the climate indices (ALPI, AOI and MOI). Oscillations in the decadal climate shifts between the two regionsled to zonal differences in larval transport and recruitment, and hence differences in the abundance of the pelagicfish populations. During deep Aleutian Lows, as in the 1980 s, larval transport from the East China Sea to theKOC region increases {{in association with the}} strong winter Asian monsoon, cool regime and increased volumetransport of the Kuroshio Current systems, whereas during a weak Aleutian Low (as in the 1990 s), larvaltransport to the TWC region increased in association with a weak winter Asian monsoon, a warm regime, andincreased volume transport of the Tsushima current system. We postulate that the increased chub mackerelabundance in the TWC region and the decreased abundance in the KOC region in the 1990 s are partly attributedto changes in recruitment and availability to the fishing fleets under the warm regime in the spawning and nurserygrounds in the East China Sea in association with the quasi-steady state of mild winter monsoon in the 1990 s. The fluctuations in chub mackerel and jack mackerel abundance are under the environment-dependant growthform, although the tropicalization was identified in the TWC region. The density-dependant growth form wasfound in <b>Japanese</b> <b>sardine</b> populations, but no tropicalization by fishing was identified in the long (10 ～ 15 year) periods of abundance despite their short (3 ～ 4 year) generation time, suggesting that the environment-dependantgrowth form drove the changes in abundance.
