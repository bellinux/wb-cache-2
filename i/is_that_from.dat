5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed that Japanese players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} here <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> {{this time}} onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired {{to an even}} tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. There seems to {{be little doubt that}} the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, even if his initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E

25|$|The {{general view}} in the fluid {{mechanics}} community <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the Navier–Stokes equations (which are used to describe viscous flow).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Roman {{paintings}} of Priapus have survived. One {{of the most}} famous images of Priapus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. A fresco depicts the god weighing his phallus against a large bag of coins. In nearby Herculaneum, an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus behind the bar, apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers.|$|E
25|$|A problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> 931 to 935, two ealdormen {{with the}} name Uhtred witness royal {{charters}}. The charters labelled Sawyer numbers 412, 413, 416, 417, 418, 407, and 434 are all subscribed by two Uhtreds. Historian Cyril Hart argued in 1975 that this second Uhtred was an ealdorman of Essex, but by 1987 thought his jurisdiction fell over the shires of North-Western Mercia. Hart believed that this Uhtred's successor in North-Western Mercia was Æthelmund, ruling between 940 and 965.|$|E

25|$|Tarlochan Singh Bedi (1999) {{writes that}} the Gurmukhī script {{developed}} in the 10-14th centuries from the Devasesha stage of the Śāradā script, the intermediate phase being Siddha Matrika, before the final evolution into Gurmukhī. His argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the 10th century, regional differences started to appear between the Śāradā script used in Punjab, the Hill States (partly Himachal Pradesh) and Kashmir. The regional Śāradā script evolved from this stage until the 14th century, when it starts {{to appear in the}} form of Gurmukhī. Indian epigraphists call this stage Devasesha, while Bedi prefers the name Pritham Gurmukhī or Proto-Gurmukhī.|$|E
25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively on his own and our behalf, the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony. In 1911 the word Cubism was born {{in the same way as}} the word 'Impressionism' in 1872.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} {{the rates}} from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively {{lower than the}} rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, or they have been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oil—that is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but the net result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> Maine to California the general arrangement of open rates on petroleum oil is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors.|$|E

25|$|Only 25 of {{the players}} on a Major League Baseball team's 40-man major league reserve list may be active for the major league club, with two {{exception}}s. One minor exception is that when a team is scheduled to play a day-night doubleheader, it is allowed to carry 26 players on the active roster for that day only. The more significant exception <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> September 1 {{to the end of}} the regular season, teams are allowed to expand their game-day rosters to 40 players. The remaining 15 players are generally either on the disabled list or play at some level of the minor leagues (usually at the Triple-A or Double-A level). Players on the 40-man reserve list are eligible for membership in the Major League Baseball Players Association. The minor league players work at the lower end of major league pay scales and are covered by all rules and player agreements {{of the players}} association. Minor league players not on the 40-man reserve list are under contract to their respective parent Major League Baseball clubs but have no union. They generally work for far less pay as they develop their skills and work their way up the ladder toward the major leagues. Many players have signing bonuses and other additional compensation that can run into the millions of dollars, although that is generally reserved for early round draft picks.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> {{around the}} 13th century {{the local area}} was owned by the Colt family, sometimes known as Coats, and their estate generated place-names such as Coatbridge, Coatdyke, Coathill and Coatbank. [...] Drummond and Smith suggest the name derives from the granting of land to Ranulphus le Colt {{around the time of}} the 12th century. However, Early Scots [...] had vocalized to [...] by the 16th century and subsequently diphthongised to [...] in Modern Scots, so that 'Colt' would have become 'Cowt' rather than 'Coat'.

500|$|Since Robert Bartlett's {{pioneering}} work, The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950–1350 (1993), {{reinforced by}} Moore's The First European Revolution, c.970–1215 (2000), {{it has become}} increasingly apparent that better understanding of David's [...] "revolution" [...] can be achieved by recognising the wider [...] "European revolution" [...] taking place during this period. The central idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old Carolingian heartlands in northern France and western Germany were spreading to outlying areas, creating a more recognisable [...] "Europe". Scotland was just one of many [...] "outlying" [...] areas.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1860s the railroads had {{extended}} their rails to Minneapolis/St. Paul {{and they began}} to actively advertise Minnesota as a tourist destination. [...] The 1878 Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railway promotional booklet, A Guide to the Summer Resorts of Minnesota, told of the delights and health benefits of travel to Minnesota: [...] "The scenery is unequaled and the invigorating air is so rich in oxygen and ozone that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world and is sure to offer to the tourist and the invalid a hearty welcome, confident that the one will surely find rest and enjoyment, and the other that much coveted of earthly blessings — health." [...] The booklet describes the coach ride from Minneapolis to Minnehaha Falls: [...] "One of the famous trips that few tourists miss taking <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> Minneapolis to St. Paul by carriage. [...] Starting from the former place {{on the west side of}} the river, a pleasant drive of four miles over a level prairie, brings the traveler to Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and gleam among the oak trees.

500|$|Over 500 {{columns and}} thirty years, Dunne's use of Irish dialect {{remained}} fairly consistent. [...] He avoided stereotypically Irish words like begorrah. Among the vowel shifts Dunne used <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>from</b> ē (as {{in the first}} vowel sound in [...] "easily") to ā (thus, it becomes [...] "aisily"). The word [...] "my" [...] becomes [...] "me" [...] {{in the mouth of}} Dooley, and [...] "by" [...] becomes [...] "be", but these are more grammatical distortions than vowel shifts. The letter [...] "y" [...] is often used to begin constructions beginning with multiple vowels, like [...] "-ious" [...] and [...] "-iate", thus they become [...] "-yus" [...] (gloryus) and [...] "-yate" [...] (humilyate) and when added next to consonants or diphthongs can distort the word in a way confusing to the reader (villain becomes villyan; giant becomes joynt). Some of the puns that Dunne made transcend language barriers, as when Dooley renders Émile Zola's famous admonition in the Dreyfus case, J'accuse (I accuse!), as [...] "jackuse" [...] (jackass). Pronouncing it at Dreyfus's trial gets Zola [...] "thrun ... out" [...] for [...] "a hell of a mane thing to say to anny man".|$|E
