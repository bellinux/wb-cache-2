5|$|Max-Hellmuth Ostermann {{was born}} on 11December 1917 in Hamburg. His father was a civil servant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> <b>department.</b> Ostermann joined the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker (Officer Cadet) in March 1937 after he had {{received}} his Abitur (diploma)—the final exams that pupils take {{at the end of}} their secondary education. His first assignment was with I. Gruppe (1st group) Zerstörergeschwader 1 (ZG1) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and participated in the Invasion of Poland in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Late in the Reagan Administration, Keating {{continued}} to serve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> {{in his role}} as associate attorney general. In 1990, President Bush elevated Keating to general counsel and acting deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that department’s second highest office, under Secretary Jack Kemp. He would serve as deputy secretary until 1993. As {{was the case in the}} Reagan administration, Keating became the highest ranking Oklahoman in the federal government, under Bush.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960 presidential election, White put his {{football}} celebrity {{to use as}} chair of John F. Kennedy's campaign in Colorado. White had first met the candidate when White was a Rhodes scholar and Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy, was Ambassador to the Court of St. James. During the Kennedy administration, White served as United States Deputy Attorney General, the number two man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> under Robert F. Kennedy. He {{took the lead in}} protecting the Freedom Riders in 1961, negotiating with Alabama Governor John Malcolm Patterson.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 1973, after Cox {{refused to}} drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson {{resigned}} in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon’s search for someone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> willing to fire Cox ended with the Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon’s order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being “perceived {{as a man who}} did the President’s bidding to save my job.” Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.|$|E

25|$|After {{the deaths}} of his wife Pauline and infant son Alfred in mid-1876, Mosby decided to move his family to Washington, D.C., but had {{difficulty}} finding enough legal business to support them. He thus spent much time campaigning for the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes. Scandals had rocked the Grant Administration as it ended, but Hayes became the next President, and Mosby hoped for a patronage appointment. He also courted powerful Ohio Congressman James Garfield, telling him his desire for a government position, preferably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> He was instead offered a position as trade representative to Canton, but ultimately confirmed by the Senate as United States consul to Hong Kong (a position he held from 1878 to 1885).|$|E
25|$|When Mosby {{returned}} to Washington in 1901, {{during the second}} term of the McKinley administration (wary during the first term because of McKinley's service in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, {{as well as being}} perceived as just another office-seeker), he again sought a job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> After McKinley's assassination, President Theodore Roosevelt instead sent Mosby west as a special agent of the Department of the Interior. There, Mosby dealt with illegal fencing of range land by cattle barons in Colorado and Nebraska, who often used fake homestead claims by military widows as well as violated the Van Wyck Fence Law of 1885. When witnesses refused to come forward to testify about illegal fencing for fear of retaliation, Mosby upheld the law by first sending notices to the affected landowner. The Pawnee Cattle Company capitulated in Colorado, so Mosby moved on to western Nebraska, where he learned the land agent actually lived in Iowa and failed to supervise the range.|$|E
500|$|President-elect Bill Clinton {{had vowed}} to {{assemble}} {{an administration that}} [...] "looked like America", and it was widely assumed {{that one of the}} major cabinet posts would go to a woman.

[...] No woman had previously served in this post. [...] His choice, whose nomination was announced on December 24, 1992, was Zoë Baird, a 40-year-old senior vice president and general counsel at Aetna Life and Casualty Company who had previously worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> during the Carter administration.|$|E

2500|$|John R. Schmidt, {{associate}} {{attorney general}} (1994–1997) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> under President Bill Clinton, expressed {{a need for}} programmatic approval of technology-enabled surveillance programs. He recalled early arguments made by then-Attorney General Edward Levi to the Church Committee that foreign intelligence surveillance legislation should include provisions for programmatically authorizing surveillance programs because of the particular needs of foreign intelligence where [...] "virtually continuous surveillance, which by its nature does not have specifically predetermined targets" [...] may be required. In these situations, [...] "the efficiency of a warrant requirement would be minimal." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, seven Republican {{members of}} the Senate Judiciary Committee {{sent a letter to}} {{committee}} chairman Senator Patrick Leahy, calling for a hearing on potential [...] "widespread politicization and possible corruption" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> in regard to its decision to narrow the case.

2500|$|Since 1935, as {{an element}} of the United States Department of Justice, the FBI had been {{headquartered}} in the Department of Justice Building. In March 1962, the Kennedy administration proposed spending $60 million to construct a headquarters for the FBI {{on the north side of}} Pennsylvania Avenue NW opposite the Justice Department. The administration argued that the FBI, which had offices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> building as well as 16 other sites in the capital, was too dispersed to function effectively. Initially, prospects for the new building seemed good. [...] A House committee approved the budget request on April 11, and a Senate committee approved it a day later. But the United States House of Representatives deleted the funds when the budget reached the House floor. A budget conference committee then voted in September to restore enough funds for site selection, planning, and preliminary design.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, {{the charges}} against Ball were dropped. The other four went to trial in 2014. The jury found Slatten guilty of first-degree murder, {{and the other three}} guards (Slough, Liberty and Heard) guilty of at least three counts of {{voluntary}} manslaughter and using a machine gun to commit a violent crime. [...] Jurors sided with prosecutors' contention that the shooting was a criminal act, not a battlefield encounter gone wrong. [...] Slatten faced a potential sentence of life in prison. [...] The other three guards faced decades in prison; the weapons charges carried a minimum 30-year sentence under a law enacted during the 1990s cocaine epidemic. [...] The weapons charges were a bone of contention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> which initially opposed including them in the indictment. [...] When it was ultimately added, defense attorneys contended a 30-year sentence would be too severe, since the law was intended to deter gang members from carrying automatic weapons.|$|E
