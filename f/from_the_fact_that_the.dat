5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used {{a special}} away kit when playing at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, {{representing}} the Brazilian colours blue and yellow, a superstition borne <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> club {{found it hard}} to win there.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title arrived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E

30|$|As {{a common}} ground, {{it is argued}} that human-powered search engines suffer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are still just as easy to “game” as more {{traditional}} engines [12] and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they have to persuade their users to provide feedback (implicit or explicit) in order to succeed.|$|R
5|$|With the {{development}} of the rail network, Roskilde became an important hub for traffic with Copenhagen. In the 1870s and 1880s, the harbour was extended attracting industrial firms to the area. By the end of the century, there were tobacco factories, iron foundries and machine shops. At the beginning of the 20th century, Roskilde first prospered as a satellite community for Copenhagen but then, as ships increased in size, suffered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> harbour was too small and Roskilde Fjord too shallow for navigation. Industries began {{to move out of the}} harbour area but were still the largest source of employment, thanks in part to the spirits factory (De Danske Spritfabrikker) and the slaughterhouse (Roskilde Andelssvineslagteri).|$|E
5|$|A minimum term {{of service}} of 25 years was established, {{at the end}} of which the {{retiring}} auxiliary soldier, and all his children, were awarded Roman citizenship. This is deduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first known Roman military diplomas date from the time of Claudius. This was a folding bronze tablet engraved with the details of the soldier's service record, which he could use to prove his citizenship. Claudius also decreed that prefects of auxiliary regiments must all be of equestrian rank, thus excluding centurions from such commands. The fact that auxiliary commanders were now all of the same social rank as most tribuni militum, (military tribunes, a legion's senior staff officers, all of whom only one, the tribunus laticlavius, was of the higher senatorial rank), probably indicates that auxilia now enjoyed greater prestige. Indigenous chiefs continued to command some auxiliary regiments, and were probably granted equestrian rank for the purpose. It is also likely that auxiliary pay was standardised at this time, but we only have estimates for the Julio-Claudian period.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the exact import of the inscription, scholars seem to agree that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) {{at the hands of the}} indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess. The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta. Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On {{the other side of}} the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit {{the trauma of the}} Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|The Jardines de la Galera {{date back}} to the 10th century. They are nestled between the Torre de Espantaperros and the Chemin de ronde, within the Alcazaba. Many Alhambran ruins still exist within the gardens, and have been open to the public since 2007 after the site was {{restored}} after being closed for more than thirty years. The etymology of the gardens stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gardens provided a respite for prisoners sentenced to the gallows in Seville. Plant species extant in the gardens include cinnamomum camphora, dichondra repens, ceiba speciosa, and trees of the myrtle, laurel, orange, lemon, and pomegranate. Other parks and gardens include Castelar, which has a central pond and several monuments dedicated to the romanticist writer Carolina Coronado and to Luis Chamizo Trigueros, la Legión, Rivillas y Calamón, San Fernando, and La Viña.The city also has a water and leisure park, called the Lusiberia.|$|E
