5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{take a long}} tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell {{into a kind of}} somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

60|$|While he {{uttered the}} last words, I felt my self-possession returning. I could not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> speak, as I would fain have spoken--I could only move away, to leave him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll go together,' {{repeated}} Lagnier. 'You {{shall see}} how soon I will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it. It is agreed? Are we one?' ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> mention Van Brandt's name, {{rather than}} hear it pass her lips.|$|E
60|$|From that moment, {{whenever}} I {{felt as if}} it {{was impossible}} to take another step, I looked at Darius, and <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> forget weariness or hunger.|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think she}} has done badly for herself, so far,” I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> say. “I suppose you know that she began life by herding the village goats.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, it's not my fault. I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> believe. If {{there is}} a God after all and he punishes me because I {{honestly}} don't believe in Him I can't help it." ...|$|R
5000|$|On my honor, {{and with}} the grace of God I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> serve {{as best you can}} my church, my country, to help my {{neighbor}} in all circumstances and to fulfill the Law Scout ...|$|R
5000|$|... ("On my honor, {{and with}} the grace of God, I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> serve with the best that I can do, to my church and my homeland, to help my fellow man/woman in any circumstance, and to uphold the Scout Law.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Secretary as {{suddenly}} brightened, and returned: 'Upon my honour I had no thought but for you. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be constrained, lest you might misinterpret my being more natural. There. It's gone.' ...|$|E
60|$|So far I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to}} him. At those last words {{the picture of}} the future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I'm a coward--a {{natural born}} coward--and I {{can have a}} lot of fun <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> face the shell and shrapnel. That's the truth; I'm not a liar. And for a long time I've been wondering--wondering--" [...] His voice died away in a murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> assume {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would {{perhaps have}} been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. I must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write of them at once. Something warns me that if I delay, though only till to-morrow, I shall be {{incapable}} of relating them at all.|$|R
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|E
60|$|Then I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} {{of this or that}} trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bess, {{the fact}} is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a fellow dream. So I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> think. We can't live this way much longer. Soon I'll simply {{have to go to}} Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack train of supplies. I can get--" ...|$|E
60|$|Such moods {{were to come}} to {{me again}} and again, and {{particularly}} during the inactivities of voyages and in large empty spaces and at night when I was weary. At other times I could banish and overcome them by <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be busy and by going to see novel and moving things.|$|R
5000|$|Brown {{had lost}} {{focus on the}} book: [...] "For maybe half a year I'd been <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> work on Underwater {{despite the fact that}} I had lost my way. So when my father died, it made me not want to waste my time with {{projects}} that weren't working out." [...] Chester Brown, 2005 ...|$|R
60|$|Andr. I cannot, for my hand obeys me not; But, as in slumbers, when we fain {{would run}} From our {{imagined}} fears, our idle feet Grow to the ground, our struggling voice dies inward; So now, when I would <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> chear you, My faltering tongue can give no glad presage: Alas, I am no more Andromache.|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} to give up {{pursuing}} the inquiry to that final point, but I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> abandon all idea of continuing it. Seeing her as I saw her now, {{it would have been}} cruel to think of anything but the necessity and the humanity of restoring her composure.|$|E
6000|$|... "One evening {{coming in}} with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} the end of the battle. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> endure it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made frank {{confession}} to that effect, and we retired. We heard afterward that the black cock died in the ring, and fighting to the last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, Aunt Roxy," [...] said Mara, [...] "at any rate, it's {{a relief}} to speak out to some one. It's {{more than two months}} that I have felt every day more and more that there was no hope,--life has hung on me like a weight. I have had <b>to</b> make <b>myself</b> keep up, and make myself do everything, and no one knows how it has tried me. I am so tired all the time, I could cry; and yet when I go to bed nights I can't sleep, I lie in such a hot, restless way; and then before morning I am drenched with cold sweat, and feel so weak and wretched. I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> eat, and I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> talk and laugh, and it's all pretense; and it wears me out,--it would be better if I stopped trying,--it would be better to give up and act as weak as I feel; but how can I let them know?" ...|$|R
60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> back <b>to</b> my own affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Frank, be true with me. I am <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> speak {{truth to}} you. I think that {{between you and}} me, at any rate, {{there should be no}} words spoken that are not true. Frank, you know where my heart is." [...] As she said this, she stood over him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder. [...] "Will you answer me one question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} are kind enough to tell me we have {{understood}} each other, Miss Halcombe," [...] I said, [...] "now {{that you are}} sure of my gratitude for your forbearance and my obedience to your wishes, may I venture to ask who"--(I hesitated--I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> think of him, but it was harder still to speak of him, as her promised husband)--"who the gentleman engaged to Miss Fairlie is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had really}} not {{supposed}} {{it possible that}} she could be more unendurable than ever. When she mentioned her Christian name, she succeeded nevertheless in producing that result. In the whole list of women's names, is there any one to be found so absolutely sickening as [...] "Selina"? I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> pronounce it; I made another neatly-expressed apology; I said English servants were so very peculiar. Selina was more than satisfied; she was quite delighted.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned in}} an instant, and tore the {{hair back from}} her face. For a moment, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look at her; for a moment, I confronted the {{smouldering}} fever in her cheeks; {{the glare of the}} bloodshot eyes; the distortion of the parched lips; the hideous clutching of the outstretched fingers at the empty air--but the agony of that sight was more than I could endure: I turned away my head, and hid my face in horror.|$|E
5000|$|... "Because I don't do stand-up, radio {{has always}} been my equivalent, {{a place to stay}} in {{connection}} with the public and <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write every week and come up with new characters. Plus it's a medium that - having grown up with it and putting <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> sleep with a radio under my pillow a kid- I love. No matter what picture you want to create in the listener's mind, a few minutes of work gets it done." [...] —Harry Shearer ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Teddy Bear, {{you know}} I couldn't. But I could run away, I could hide from you, I could lock <b>myself</b> up and <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> not <b>to</b> come to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|She {{was offered}} many {{roles in the}} 1940s and {{throughout}} her retirement years but she rejected {{all but a few}} of them. In the few instances when she accepted, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused to talk to friends throughout her life about her reasons for retiring, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman four years before her death [...] "I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> go to the studio… I really wanted to live another life." ...|$|R
