5|$|On 10 January 1964, a B-52H {{flown by}} Boeing test pilots lost its {{vertical}} stabilizer to turbulence near East Spanish Peak. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> land at Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closure}} of Dunston Staithes in 1980, the Swing Bridge {{downstream}} of the stations seldom had to be opened. (Because Bessie Surtees was low lying, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pass underneath the bridge at low tide.) However, on 15 December 1975, Bessie Surtees collided with the Swing Bridge, forcing it to close {{for the rest of}} that weekend.|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> walk {{on either}} two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased {{the height of}} the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5000|$|The Roboquad's legs all swivel {{around and}} so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> walk forward, {{backwards}} and sideways {{at about the}} same rate and mobility. <b>Its</b> head <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> swivel around completely, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> scan its surroundings without turning its body.|$|R

5|$|The barge {{was used}} to {{transport}} materials between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and after the diesel engines were added, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> push another barge. It was in service between 1941 and 1972, and afterwards was moored in Bridgeport Harbor together with the Berkshire No. 7 and Priscilla Dailey, two other barges.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} to various Caribbean islands to counter a number of pests infesting local crops. While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> establish itself on some islands, such as Barbados, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, other introductions, such as in Cuba before 1900 and in 1946, and on the islands of Dominica and Grand Cayman, were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} was {{formally}} announced on 2 April after an LM convention. As the LM {{had already begun}} establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pick up momentum readily, presenting itself as a centrist moderate party, {{but it was never}} able to shed its reliance on Hall.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> invade a {{range of}} habitats, from pine flatwoods to {{mangrove}} marshes. It grows {{in a wide range}} of soil types, including salty coastal soil, but is sensitive to heavy salt spray. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> fire-adapted, meaning <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> resprout prolifically after fire.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> a nocturnal fish {{like many}} catfish. It feeds on living, {{as well as}} dead, animal matter. Because of its wide mouth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> swallow {{relatively}} large prey whole. <b>It</b> has <b>been</b> known to take large waterbirds such as the common moorhen. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> crawl on dry ground to escape drying pools. Further, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> survive in shallow mud {{for long periods of}} time, between rainy seasons.|$|R
25|$|Also novel bio-assays like DR CALUX are {{nowadays}} used in {{identification of}} dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The advantage {{in respect to}} HRGC/HRMS <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> scan many samples at lower costs. Also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detect all compounds that interact with the Ah-receptor {{which is responsible for}} carcinogenic effects.|$|R
5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On {{the eve of the}} Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{short period}} of abandonment, Park Hall was {{purchased}} from the council by Mike Harris with a view to redevelopment and The New Saints moving back to the ground. The New Saints started to use Park Hall as their regular home ground again in 2007 and the ground was further improved so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> host matches in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. It has since been used to host youth international fixtures for both England and Wales while also hosting Non-League football for community teams in Oswestry.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By the autumn of 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from one bit to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E

5|$|HTC One {{variants}} were unveiled {{for release}} in China in late-April 2013 with HTC TD101 802w for China Unicom, HTC TD101 802d for China Telecom, and HTC TD101 802t for China Mobile. Unlike the international version, the Chinese models feature a removable back cover, exposing a microSD slot for storage expansion and dual SIM card slots. Complementing this feature, {{a special edition}} with a Wang Leehom-autographed back cover was also released. HTC stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> include an SD card slot in the Chinese model because its radio hardware did not take up as much internal space {{as that of the}} international models.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Marshall asked Groves to {{nominate}} specific targets for bombing for final approval {{by himself and}} Stimson. Groves formed a Target Committee, chaired by himself, that included Farrell, Major John A. Derry, Colonel William P. Fisher, Joyce C. Stearns and David M. Dennison from the USAAF; and scientists John von Neumann, Robert R. Wilson and William Penney from the Manhattan Project. The Target Committee met in Washington on April 27; at Los Alamos on May 10, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> talk to the scientists and technicians there; and finally in Washington on May 28, where it was briefed by Tibbets and Commander Frederick Ashworth from Project Alberta, and the Manhattan Project's scientific advisor, Richard C. Tolman.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{with the}} {{original}} release of the song on June 2, 1984, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reach a peak of only 56. However, upon re-releasing the song on January 1, 1986, it reached a new peak of two on the chart and was present {{for a total of}} nine weeks. The song was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on February 1986, for shipment of 500,000 copies of the single. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold 310,000 copies there. Across Europe the song topped the chart in Ireland and entered the top ten of Belgium and Netherlands. It also peaked at number 23 in Switzerland and number 12 in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{circulation}} was exposed from the convection, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> intensify into Tropical Storm Pongsona at 1200UTC on December 3 while located 375km (230mi) northeast of Pohnpei. It {{turned to the}} west on December4, due to a ridge to the north. It slowly intensified, developing an eye feature on December5. That day, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Pongsona to a typhoon about 1150km (715mi) southeast of Guam.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball is {{a sports}} video game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is notable for {{being one of}} the first video games licensed by Major League Baseball, although it was not endorsed by the Major League Baseball Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official Major League Baseball licensing and lineups.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 2010, an {{incident}} occurred in Queen Mary 2s aft harmonic filter room. This {{resulted in the}} shutdown of all four propulsion motors {{and a loss of}} electrical power throughout the ship. Within an hour, the ship's main generators were restarted and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> resume passage. The later investigations finding revealed that an explosion was caused by electrical arcing within the aft harmonic filter igniting leaked dielectric fluid vapour.|$|E
5000|$|The flightlessness of B. {{antarctica}} may be {{an adaptation}} to prevent wind from blowing it into inhospitable areas. [...] It can survive the freezing of its body fluids and has a lifespan of two years; with the two growing seasons, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> accumulate the energy needed to reproduce. With its deep purplish black coloration <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> absorb heat <b>to</b> survive. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tolerate large changes in salinity and pH and can survive without oxygen for 2 - 4 weeks.|$|R

5|$|Simultaneously {{with their}} {{appearance}} on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it was confronted with a North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> disengage.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2007, SvalSat was {{expanded}} with 12 antennas. Five {{are used for}} Galileo, while the remaining are used for a large array of customers. In 2007 and 2008, both Terra and Landsat 7 were hacked twice. The hackers were able to achieve all steps {{which would have been}} necessary to take control over the satellites, but did not actually take control. The operation commanded the satellites via SvalSat, which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hack via the Internet connection.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado was {{developed}} and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy. It first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multirole design, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado {{in addition to the}} three original partner nations. A tri-nation training and evaluation unit operating from RAF Cottesmore, the Tri-National Tornado Training Establishment, maintained a level of international co-operation beyond the production stage.|$|E
