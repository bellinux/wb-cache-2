40|$|CD-Rom included; A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the MSc in Computer ScienceABSTRACT International telecommunication has become a very important sector in the present day communication. IDD traffic {{is one of the}} main sources of revenue for national telecommunication service providers (Telcos). Hence, it has to be managed properly and driven effectively to gain maximum profit. / Telco’s usually deal with multiple international operators (carriers) e. g. SingTel, Telstra, in order to use latter's networks for international traffic. These carriers offer different charging structures which vary with the time, volume and the destination. Most Telcos incur high costs due to lack of a proper system to analyse and forecast an optimized IDD <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> / Therefore, a system which is capable of producing a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> by analyzing the current IDD usage pattern and the traffic cost would be much beneficial for all Telco’s. The objective of this research work is to find a suitable methodology for Telcos to produce a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> for the IDD traffic in near real time. In our approach, the main tasks are, • Forecasting the IDD traffic pattern to each destination • Determining the optimized <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Forecasting the future traffic was based on past traffic, current IDD traffic trend and the subscriber growth rate of Telcos. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to obtain the optimized <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Dynamic behavior of the problem domain was successfully addressed in the GA structure. / The GA parameters, population size, number of generations and the GA operations (crossover, mutation and reproduction) ratio were determined experimentally. Experimental results show that our solution is capable of producing a cost-effective <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> in near-real-time which reduces the cost by 30 % to 50 % against the manual <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> Our solution could be used by national Telco’s to save significant costs in the international traffic and to pass some of that cost savings to their customers...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficient}} routing and in-network {{data processing}} emerge as two central topics in the sensor network design. On the routing part, most existing works {{focus on how}} to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network constrained by batteries and communication cost. On the in-network data processing part, one will consider issues such as dynamic suppression, data clustering and ranking based on data properties. However, in some sense, these two topics are not independent with each other. A possible scheme is to design an adaptive <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> respecting the data correlation among sensors without sacrificing too much of its lifetime, which will then facilitate the high-level in-network application such as suppression and data clustering. In this paper, we emphasize {{that in addition to}} maximizing the lifetime of a sensor network based solely on network topology and communication cost, a <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> should also take into consideration the higher-level preferences on transmissions or data correlations. Therefore, we propose the concept of bilateral routing to find such a balance and use the algebraic structure ”filtration ” to characterize such a trade-off. We then present a general framework to find the optimal <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> under bilateral sense. We discuss how to adapt our framework to various innetwork applications including suppression, clustering and aggregations.

Spreading the trains well in time and space in these areas has a big impact on the passenger robustness, i. e. the total travel time in practice of all passengers in the railway network in case of frequently occurring small delays. We focus on improving the performance in the bottleneck of the network in order to improve the performance of the whole railway network. This paper proposes a method that builds from scratch a <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> and a cyclic timetable that optimizes the infrastructure occupation and the passenger robustness. An integer linear routing model assigns, without considering a timetable, every train to a route such that the maximal node usage is minimized and that the number of times that each node is used, is quadratically penalized. Thereafter, a mixed integer linear timetabling model assigns to each train the blocking times at which the nodes on its route, assigned by the routing model, are reserved and released. Different from other approaches is that we focus on the occupation of the railway infrastructure before constructing the timetable. The approach is validated on the complex railway station area of Brussels (Belgium).

The regions which experience snow and ice storms require special attention to keep the roads safe for driving and reduce damage to property and personal loss. Any improvement made in the planning o f snow removal can save money to tax payers and the local government. In this research, a generic framework is proposed for the dynamic planning o f the snow removal process. The framework contains a heuristic, a continuous simulation model, and an interface for integrating these two. The framework accommodates both salt spraying and snow plowing operations o f the snow removal process. The framework also considers changes in the snow-fall rate and dynamically determines new <b>routing</b> <b>plans</b> for the snow removal trucks to follow, whenever changes in the snow-fall rate require a new <b>routing</b> <b>plan.</b> The heuristic developed for the framework treats snow removal routes as an undirected, hierarchical network and determines the <b>routing</b> <b>plans</b> for the snow removal trucks. The developed heuristic {{has been found to}} give a better solution compared to an existing heuristic, when the subnetwork induced by each hierarchy level is disconnected. The heuristic has also been modified to obtain a lower bound for the Hierarchical Postman Problem applied to the snow removal process. The heuristic has been implemented in Turbo C and validated using thirty-one sample networks. The simulation model developed for the framework is a continuous one, and it considers the changes in the snow-fall rate for dynamically planning the snow removal / process. When executed, the simulation model obtains a <b>routing</b> <b>plan</b> by calling the developed heuristic and simulates the salt spraying and snow plowing operations. When the snow-fall rate changes, the simulation model dynamically revises the snow removal process by calling the heuristic and obtaining a new plan.

The implemented framework has been validated using an actual snow removal problem from the city of DeKalb, Illinois. The simulation results have been found to compare favorably with manual computations, thus validating the framework.

And the optimization is from two viewpoints including cost and time. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to optimize the multi-modal transportation <b>routing</b> <b>planning</b> problem. Minimizing the total transportation cost and the total transportation time are set as the optimization objectives of the model. In order to balance the benefit between the two objectives, Pareto optimality is utilized to solve the model by gaining its Pareto frontier. The Pareto frontier of the model can provide the multi-modal transportation operator (MTO) and customers with better decision support and it is gained by the normalized normal constraint method. Then, an experimental case study is designed to verify the feasibility of the model and Pareto optimality by using the mathematical programming software Lingo. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the demand and supply in the multi-modal transportation organization is performed based on the designed case. Findings: The calculation {{results indicate that the}} proposed model and Pareto optimality have good performance in dealing with the bi-objective optimization. The sensitivity analysis also shows the influence of the variation of the demand and supply on the multi-modal transportation organization clearly.

This approach decomposes the problem into smaller sub-problems, {{taking advantage of the}} geographical distribution of clients into clusters (neighbourhoods and/or suburbs). The available vehicle time is distributed to each cluster by solving a non-linear optimisation problem. Within each cluster, an established OP heuristic is used to determine the clients to be served and the vehicle route. The proposed approach has been applied to large test cases, as well as to problem instances from actual distribution networks. The results indicate that in terms of solution quality the proposed method outperforms the methods used to solve the monolithic problem. Furthermore, the method is, in general, more efficient, especially in cases involving a large number of clients.
