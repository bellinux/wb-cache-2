Welding methods were GTAW (308 L, Ar environment) and GTAWN (316 L, Ar + N 2 environment). Yield strength of weld joint {{was higher than}} that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> but elongation <b>of</b> weld joint was lower than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> UTS <b>of</b> weld joint was slightly lower than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> Yield strength and elongation with welding method were almost same. Fatigue life of weld joint was lower than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> but fatigue strength of weld joint was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> Ferrite content was increased with welding. Fatigue life welded by GTAWN was better than that of GTAW at RT and 600 ℃. This fatigue life behavior {{was consistent with the}} behavior of ferrite content...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present three {{papers on the}} Economics <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The thesis studies production, trading, and {{investment}} in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry, and thus explains some phenomena of the industry in an international context. Using the features <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry such as the practices in production and trading, physical properties, geology of the deposits and so on, we build theoretical models to simulate {{the behavior of the}} industry. In Chapter One, we study the determinants and the trend <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices over time by an equilibrium model of supply and demand. Because the different types of natural resources exhibit different patterns of price changes in history, we particularly simulate the long run equilibrium to study the impacts of the determinants for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices. The Cobb-Douglass production function on the supply side allows substitution among production factors. The demand function for <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> from the economy is also derived. In the long run, equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand determines the systematic price trend. We show how trends <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices depend on technological progress, resource scarcity, natural resource tax, and the interest rate. Assuming constant returns to scale in <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> production, the price elasticity of the supply <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> is relatively small. Interestingly, a high natural resource tax leads to a high price but low rate of price change over time. On the supply side, the decline <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> relative prices can thus be explained by the inverse supply functions. On the demand side, the relative price is also declining over time as we see the implications of the inverse demand functions and our numerical illustrations. By solving the equilibrium condition, we show that the economic rent <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> minerals in reserve may decline over time, or even not be valuable in future. The price elasticities of supply and demand are calculated and decomposed into specific effects. These are systematic components <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> price changes in the world market. Chapter Two deals with the fluctuations in the prices <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> We consider the price in the short run as an equilibrium of trade. If the long run equilibrium regulates the prices and sets them in a stabilization, then the fluctuations in price are caused by the trade and speculative activities. By simulating speculative activities and optimizing the utility of agents in international exchanges, we show that the price fluctuations are the response to risk preferences of agents and the scale of international exchanges. We find out the critical point of production investment, which depends on the market demand, profitability of the metal industry, and the distribution <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> minerals in nature. In the specific case of the industry versus the market condition when the uncertain production is above the critical point, the price <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> fluctuates more or less according to the number of producer offers in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges, the speculative activities, and risk preferences of agents. In contrast, if the investment level <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in uncertain production is below the critical point, the effects <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> exchanges scale to the price are in the reverse direction. The comparative statics inequalities are derived to clarify the responses of the price to the risk preferences of agents and scale of the international exchanges. Hence, the non-systematic changes <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices in international exchanges are explained. Chapter Three studies the impact of the industrial and commercial processes on investment decisions in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The investment decisions of investors in the primary capital market and the stock price in the secondary capital market reflect properties <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry in capital markets. We present a model of investments, which is a two stage game that incorporates Hall-Jorgenson neoclassical investment analysis and properties <b>of</b> the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. The paper presents a set of explanatory parameters for the properties <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks and analyzes the investment decisions. We define the industry factor and explain the empirical observations on the beta coefficient <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stocks. The relationships between stock prices and <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> prices are clarified using the geology <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> deposits. The results show that there is a strong impact of the industry factor on the volatility <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> stock prices. Economies of scale in the mining industry lead to different effects of tax policy and output prices on investment decisions. We support conclusions of the model by evidence in the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> industry. There are policy implications that are derived from the equations of the optimal investment.

The {{effects of}} weld nugget size, <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> strength, mode <b>of</b> loading and pre-strain <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> on the load bearing {{capacity}} of spot-welds have been investigated using two varieties of interstitial free steel sheets. The effect of bake hardening treatment after spot-welding of pre-strained sheets has also been examined using an ultra low carbon bake hardening grade steel. The major results infer that: (i) the {{load bearing capacity}} of spot-welds increases with increasing nugget size and <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> strength, (ii) the load bearing capacity of spot-welds increases with increasing pre-strain <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> (iii) the remnant dislocation density around the spot-weld increases with increasing pre-strain, (iv) the strength of spot-welds on pre-strained sheets does not alter significantly after the baking treatment, but baking treatment increases the strength <b>of</b> pre-strained <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> and (v) the location of failure is commonly at the interface of HAZ/base metal for tensile-shear specimens and at the HAZ for cross-tension specimens...|$|R

In case of as welds condition, fracture occurred in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> unrelated to the laser source. It could be explained that tensile strength of fusion zone composed of martensite and bainite is higher than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> that contains a lot of ferrite despite dilution of Al and Si from coating layer to fusion zone. In case of hot-stamping condition, the fracture occurred in fusion zone irrelevant to laser source and the tensile strength was lower than hot stamped <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> In the CO 2 laser welds, Fe 3 (Al,Si) formed near the bond line was transformed into ferrite during hot-stamping. Therefore tensile strength of bond line is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> and center <b>of</b> fusion zone and the fracture occurred in the bond line. On the other hand, in the Nd:YAG laser welds, the higher concentration of Al formed the ferrite in the fusion zone during hot-stamping treatment.
