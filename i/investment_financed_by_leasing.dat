40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{explain why the}} current UK {{corporation}} tax discourages investment, consider how large this effect is likely to be, and discuss how this tax bias against corporate investment can best be eliminated. The present corporation tax does not raise the cost of capital {{for all types of}} investment, but does raise it for <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> retained profits. We propose a new corporate to allowance for <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> equity (the Allowance for Corporate Equity). This approach not only eliminates the discouragement to investment, hut also reduces or eliminates most other distortions to company behavior that result from the current corporation tax. The new allowance can be partly <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> eliminating the present tax advantages of dividend income for tax-exempt investors, and this may have an additional benefit for investment by removing one source of pressure for high dividend pay-out ratios in the UK...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{monetary}} theory of business cycles as presented by the so called Austrian school of economics. It analyzes the different economic effects of <b>investments</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> saving as opposed to <b>investments</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> credit expansion. It shows that {{in the latter case}} an unsustainable situation results in which economic actors try both to invest and to consume more at the same time, which is physically impossible. The result is recession and liquidation of malinvestments made during the boom. The thesis also provides an answer to critiques of the Austrian business cycle theory by proponents of the rational expectations hypothesis. Furthermore, a critique of traditional national income accounting measures, namely GDP, is put forward. These measures fail to adequately show the described cyclical changes in the economy's productive structure, e. g. the artificial boom and subsequent correction. Gross domestic revenue (GDR) is proposed as an alternative measure that adds the expenditure on intermediate products back to GDP.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of tax laws on foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) and direct investment abroad (DIA), distinguishing in each case between <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> retained earnings and <b>investment</b> <b>financed</b> <b>by</b> transfers from abroad. We find that tax policy, through its effect on the rate-of-return available in the U. S., has an important effect on the international location of investment. FDI in the U. S. is very sensitive to after-tax rates-of-return available here. U. S. direct investment abroad is also affected, although to a lesser extent. We use these estimates to examine {{the effects of}} the 1981 - 82 tax changes on the international location of investment. We estimate that the tax changes lowered annual DIA by $ 0. 5 billion to $ 1. 0 billion (2 % to 4 % of its 1980 value), and raised annual FDI by $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion (11 % of 20 % of its 1980 value). We also discuss the welfare effects of tax policy toward international investment. Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international location of investment are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS andthe ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment without losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate domestic fixed investment, but also attract additional investment from abroad. The additional investment supplements the domestic investment impact on productivity and raises corporate tax revenue. However, our results should be taken as preliminary estimates, not as definitive statements about the long-run impacts of tax policy. ...|$|R

Across a wide array of estimators our principal finding is remarkably robust; the average aggregate gross return on “aid investments ” falls in a 20 - 30 percent range, roughly the same as the return on investments funded by other sources than aid. This finding is well in accord with micro estimates of the economic return to aid...|$|R

He notes that there are three possible channels through which an ITC can act on investment: price, income, and multiplier effects.

Based on these findings, Karier concludes that alternatives to tax investment credit programs must be found and pursued.
