50|$|The systems marketed in North America as the 1A, 6A, 1A1 and the 1A2 Key System {{are typical}} {{examples}} and sold for many decades. The 1A family of Western Electric Company (WECo) key telephone units (KTUs) {{were introduced in}} the late 1930s and remained in use to the 1950s. 1A equipment was primitive and required at least two KTUs per line; one for line termination and one for station (telephone instrument) termination. The telephone instrument commonly used by 1A systems was the WECo 300-series telephone. Introduced in 1953, 1A1 key systems simplified wiring with a single KTU for both line and station termination, and increased the features available. As the 1A1 systems became commonplace, requirements for intercom features grew. The original intercom KTUs, WECo Model 207, were wired for a single talk link, that is, a single conversation on the intercom at a time. The WECo 6A <b>dial</b> <b>intercom</b> system provided two talk links and was often installed as the <b>dial</b> <b>intercom</b> in a 1A1 or 1A2 key system. The 6A systems were complex, troublesome and expensive, and never became popular. The advent of 1A2 technology in the 1964 simplified key system set up and maintenance. These continued to be used throughout the 1980s, when the arrival of electronic key systems with their easier installation and greater features signaled the end of electromechanical key systems.|$|E
50|$|The 1A2 {{system used}} a modular plug-in {{construction}} concept that permitted many configurations {{using the same}} basic components. A typical system consisted of a basic metal mounting frame, the Key Service Unit (KSU), also called a panel, with card-edge connectors and mounting brackets for components and punch-down blocks for interconnecting cabling. The principal switching and control modules were constructed on printed circuit boards, called Key Telephone Units (KTU). KTUs provided many system features, such as various types of line interfaces, <b>dial</b> <b>intercom,</b> music-on-hold, and alarms. Each central office telephone line connected to the system required at least one KTU.|$|E
50|$|On July 28, 2006, Haq {{is alleged}} to have gained access to the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle {{building}} by holding a 13-year-old girl hostage with a gun to her back and ordering her to <b>dial</b> the <b>intercom</b> and request to be buzzed into the building. After entering, he then began shooting. Pamela Waechter was killed. Layla Bush, Christina Rexroad and Cheryl Stumbo were critically wounded. Dayna Klein and Carol Goldman were wounded.|$|R
