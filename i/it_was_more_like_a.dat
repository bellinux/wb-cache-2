5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, {{a summary of the}} comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Joneses were {{assisted}} by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad {{including more than}} 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> holiday camp than an archaeological dig. In {{the final stages of}} the dig, volunteers were supplemented by local unemployed people, funded by a government job creation scheme. Without this extra assistance, the excavation might not have been completed.|$|E

[...] He {{joined the}} Pathological Society of London (which eventually merged into the Royal Society of Medicine) {{when it was}} formed in 1846. [...] He also belonged to the London Electrical Society founded by William Sturgeon and others. [...] This body was very unlike the elite scholarly institutions; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> craft guild {{with a penchant for}} spectacular demonstrations. [...] Nevertheless, it had some notable members, and new machines and apparatus were regularly discussed and demonstrated. [...] Bird was also a Freemason from 1841 and was the Worshipful Master of the St Paul's lodge in 1850. [...] He left the Freemasons in 1853.Payne and McConnell ...|$|E
5|$|Some recent genetic {{evidence}} suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose {{belongs in the}} genus Stenella, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common bottlenose.|$|R
5000|$|He {{did not see}} {{his work}} as {{particularly}} complex. As he puts <b>it,</b> “it <b>was</b> not high tech, or very scientific. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> something you’d do in your garage.” ...|$|R
25|$|According to Tim Brooke-Taylor twenty {{per cent}} {{of the show is}} ad-libbed. According to Willie Rushton, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> fifty per cent, but he didn't think that a bad thing.|$|R
2500|$|His {{statement}} was precipitated by a [...] "strike" [...] conducted by several pro-Clinton diarists, even {{though none of}} these posters was paid or in any way officially linked to the site. Moulitsas responded directly to the [...] "strike" [...] by saying that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "boycott", noting that [...] "It's a big Internet, so I hope they find what they're looking for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Portman's co-star in the film, Mila Kunis, {{also gave}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly in which she said, [...] "Natalie danced her ass off" [...] and that [...] " [...] tell you , no, she was not on pointe when she did a fouetté [...] No one's going to deny that. But she did do every ounce of every one of her dances .... wasn't used for everything. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> safety net. If Nat wasn't able to do something, you'd have a safety net. The same thing that I had — I had a double as a safety net. We all did. No one ever denied it".|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. Then I saw {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘No, sir, indeed, my lord,’ said he, with a {{burst of}} confidence. ‘No, indeed, Mr. Anne, and it do not surely. I should say now, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Pole.’ ...|$|R

5000|$|Potjevleesch is a {{traditional}} French Flemish dish, which can be translated into English as [...] "potted meat", although in appearance <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a terrine or head cheese than a pâté.|$|R
2500|$|Plesiosaurus {{was one of}} {{the first}} of the [...] "antediluvian reptiles" [...] to be {{discovered}} and excited great interest in Victorian England. It was so-named ("near lizard") by William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche, to indicate that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal reptile than Ichthyosaurus, which had been found in the same rock strata just a few years earlier. Plesiosaurus is the archetypical genus of Plesiosauria and the first to be described, hence lending its name to the order. Conybeare and De la Beche coined the name for scattered finds from the Bristol region, Dorset, and Lyme Regis in 1821. The type species of Plesiosaurus, P. dolichodeirus, was named and described by Conybeare in 1824 on the basis of Anning's original finds.|$|E
2500|$|Casualties for the Battle of Lookout Mountain were {{relatively}} light {{by the standards}} of the Civil War: 408 Union, 1,251 Confederate (including 1,064 captured or missing). Sylvanus Cadwallader, a war reporter accompanying Grant's army, wrote that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "magnificent skirmish", than a major battle. General Grant, whose focus was on the northern end of Missionary Ridgeand who was usually partial to the achievements of his key subordinates in the Western armieslater denigrated Hooker's achievement, writing in his memoirs, [...] "The battle of Lookout Mountain is one of the romances of the war. There was no such battle and no action even worthy to be called the battle on Lookout Mountain. It is all poetry." [...] Nevertheless, the action was important in assuring control of the Tennessee River and the railroad into Chattanooga and endangering the entire Confederate line on Missionary Ridge. Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, quartermaster general of the Union Army, observing the fog-shrouded action from Orchard Knob, was the first writer to name it the [...] "Battle Above the Clouds".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the saving}} {{of the ship}} {{is a great thing}} for us. We can hardly call this a shipwreck, Mr. Mark, though we have <b>been</b> ashore once; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> being docked, than {{anything}} else!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may be that}} a boat awaits him at Rye or Hythe; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that he has {{all ready}} to depart from here. Ah, see yonder! I'll warrant that the Red Ferret is on board!" ...|$|R
60|$|Ruthven's {{study was}} like himself, overdressed and rather futile. It ran to little china {{ornaments}} {{in a good}} deal of profusion. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> drawing-room than a school study.|$|E
6000|$|... "... You don't {{know the}} half of it, dearie, you don't know {{the half of}} it! A {{one-piece}} bathing suit! Well, {{you could call it}} that, but the cop of the beach said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby's sock. And when...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] he answered, {{and that}} {{satisfied}} her better than {{if he had}} entered into those subtleties which {{she had tried to}} express: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man. He had his arm about her again, and she put down her hand on his to press it closer against her heart.|$|E
60|$|And in the meantime, {{except for}} the tenseness of it, and for the incessant watchfulness which Margaret and I alone maintain, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a mild adventure, <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a page out of some book of romance which ends happily.|$|R
5000|$|Zocchihedron is the {{trademark}} of a 100-sided [...] die invented by Lou Zocchi, which debuted in 1985. Rather {{than being a}} polyhedron, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a ball with 100 flattened planes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called [...] "Zocchi's Golfball".|$|R
5000|$|Cicero's {{description}} of the ideal state, in De re publica, does not equate to a modern-day [...] "republic"; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> enlightened absolutism. His philosophical works were influential when Enlightenment philosophers such as Voltaire developed their political concepts.|$|R
60|$|There was {{one other}} {{memory of the}} past, dim and faded, but stamped into his soul {{everlasting}} by the savage feet of his father. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nightmare than a remembered vision of a concrete thing--more like the race-memory of man that makes him fall in his sleep and {{that goes back to}} his arboreal ancestry.|$|E
6000|$|... de Cartienne's rooms, {{especially}} his study, were furnished far more luxuriously than mine and in excellent taste. The walls and chimney-piece {{were covered with}} charming little sketches, a few foreign prints, photographs, and dainty little trifles of bric-a-brac. Except for the photographs, {{some of which were}} a little risque, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lady's boudoir than a man's sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|The fight lasted {{one round}} {{of an hour}} and ten minutes. It was {{lengthened}} until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> war or a family feud than a fight. Haywood had learned some of the science of boxing and wrestling from his tutors, but these he discarded for the more instinctive methods of battle handed down by the cave-dwelling Van Plushvelts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Valentina!" [...] he cried, as he sprang after her, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the growl of a beast {{than the}} cry of a lover. He caught her, and with scant {{ceremony}} he dragged {{her back into the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... 11. Here, for instance, is {{the head}} of a soldier by Dürer,--a mere {{gridiron}} of black lines. Would this be better or worse engraving if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a photograph or lithograph, and no lines seen?--suppose, <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the head of Mr. Santley, now in all the music-shops, and really quite deceptive in light and shade, when seen from over the way? Do you think Dürer's work would <b>be</b> better if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that? And would you have me, therefore, leaving the question of technical method of production altogether to the craftsman, consider pictorial engraving simply as the production of a light-and-shade drawing, by some method permitting its multiplication for the public? ...|$|R
60|$|For {{every two}} guests {{there was a}} {{decanter}} of wine. At least <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what they called wine, though in taste <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> sour cider. The people generally used it by pouring a little of it into their water.|$|R
60|$|The machine plunged {{directly}} {{down the}} bank through a cut {{so deep that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> chute, struck the gangplank with a terrific bump, and seemed fairly to leap on board. The ferry was scarcely longer than the machine, and Drexel, visibly shaken by {{the closeness of the}} shave, managed to stop only when six inches remained between the front wheels and overboard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir Guy {{was a very}} {{striking}} person,' said Philip; 'I {{shall not}} easily forget my visit to Redclyffe four years ago. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scene in a romance than anything real--the fine old red sandstone house crumbling away in the exposed parts, the arched gateway covered with ivy; the great quadrangle where the sun never shone, and full of echoes; the large hall and black wainscoted rooms, which the candles never would light up. It is a fit place to be haunted.' ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{hotel was}} by no means like to a hotel in this country. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> private residence. There were no hired waiters. Her amiable daughters waited; and they did not look upon you as a customer, or conduct {{themselves}} like servants. No, they treated you as a visitor, and conducted themselves with the agreeable familiarity of friends! Of course they presented their bill when you were about to leave them, but in all other respects the idea of a hotel was banished from the mind.|$|E
50|$|In {{previous}} elections, {{voter turnout}} has run {{at less than}} 10 percent. Voter turnout in the May 2005 referendum that allowed the presidential election was officially reported as 54%, but judges monitoring the elections said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> 3%.|$|R
5000|$|And {{about her}} novel:"Mourning Ruby {{is not a}} flat landscape: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a box with {{pictures}} painted on every face. And each face is also a door which opens, I hope, to take the reader deep into the book." ...|$|R
25|$|He began {{creating}} songs {{when he was}} 17. In {{the beginning}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> putting music to his poetry and performing it with a guitar. At the age of 19 {{he made his first}} solo concert, which included 22 author songs.|$|R
