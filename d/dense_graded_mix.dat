HMA can be <b>Dense</b> <b>Graded</b> <b>mixes</b> (DGM) known as Bituminous Concrete (BC) or gap graded known as Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA).

In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the effects of use of a naturally and locally available fibre called SISAL fibre is used as stabilizer in SMA and as an additive in BC. For preparation of the mixes aggregate gradation has been taken as per MORTH specification, binder content has been varied regularly from 4 % to 7 % and fibre content varied from 0 % to maximum 0. 5 % of total mix. As a part of preliminary study, fly ash has been found to result satisfactory Marshall Properties and hence has been used for mixes in subsequent works. Using Marshall Procedure Optimum Fibre Content (OFC) for both BC and SMA mixes was found to be 0. 3 %. Similarly Optimum Binder Content (OBC) for BC and SMA were found to be 5 % and 5. 2 % respectively.

For this purpose, laboratory tests were carried out to determine the main properties to be used in numerical analyses of a structure of flexible pavement executed with that type of asphalt mixture. The mechanical properties of asphalt hot mixes used in the numerical analysis were determined by laboratory tests (stiffness modulus and fatigue life). The studied asphalt hot mixes were produced with a crumb rubber obtained by the milling process at ambient temperature and a straight binder AC 50 / 70 (classification by penetration). The incorporated rubber content varied from 2 % up to 3, 6 % in relation to the mineral aggregate mixture. For the sake of comparison, a conventional asphalt mixture produced with straight binder AC 50 / 70 and an asphalt-rubber hot mix produced by wet process were also studied.

40|$|Abstract. Coal-based {{thermal power}} {{plants have been}} a major source of power {{generation}} in India. The prime waste products of a coal thermal power plant are fly ash and bottom ash. Heavy dumping of these waste products causes fatal environment pollution to air, water, and land, besides impairing human health. This research work is done to explore the optimum use of ash, namely bottom ash (as fine aggregate) and fly ash (as mineral filler) along with natural fiber (such as sisal fiber) used to improvise the engineering properties of bituminous paving mixes. For national interest, these waste products that are available easily and abundantly can be used economically for bituminous paving applications which ultimately help in saving the natural aggregate resources of the nation. In the present study, <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> bituminous <b>mix</b> specimens were prepared using natural aggregates as coarse aggregates, bottom ash as fine aggregates, fly ash as filler and sisal fiber as additive.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) {{device was}} used to {{characterize}} the impact of various mix factors {{on the development of}} permanent deformation in dense-graded mixes given a standard compactive effort. Factors included two aggregate sizes, three VMA levels, two fines contents, three binder contents and four binder types. All specimens received the same compactive effort (100 gyrations) using the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC). For some tests, testing temperatures followed the standard APA test protocol (64 C) and for some others, the test temperature was set at the high temperature of standard performance asphalt binder grade (e. g. 70 C for a PG 70 - 22 asphalt binder). Statistical results showed that increased binder content increased permanent deformation in the 19. 0 mm <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> <b>mixes</b> prepared with the PG 64 - 22 binder irrespective of the other mix parameters. These effects were not noted in the mixes prepared with PG 70 - 22 and PG 76 - 22 binders, when tested at 64 C. However, the same effect was noted when mixes prepared with PG 70 - 22, PG 70 - 22 Modified and PG 76 - 22 binders were tested at the high temperature of standard performance asphalt binder <b>grade.</b> All <b>mixes</b> prepared with the stiffer binders showed very low permanent deformation when tested at the standard 64 C regardless {{of the value of the}} other mix parameters. The statistical analysis of permanent deformation provides evidence that the mixes prepared with the PG 76 - 22 and PG 70 - 22 Modified binders perform better than mixes prepared with the PG 70 - 22 and the PG 64 - 22 binders. The effect of VMA on permanent deformation depends on the maximum aggregate size used, test temperature, binder type and the fines content. It was not possible to separate these interaction effects. The results of this study suggest that the APA is relatively insensitive to changes in mix properties within the range of variables studied, when using the standard APA test temperature (64 C). However, the APA device is sensitive when the test temperature matches the high temperature of the standard performance binder grade (e. g. 70 C for a PG 70 - 22 binder). Based on the results of this study, it appears that the APA can be used to indicate the rut resistance of a mixture. Although some of the mix factors have an interactive effect in the mixes, the APA has a potential to predict the relative rutting of the hot mix asphalt mixes even when polymer modified mixes are used, provided that testing is conducted at the appropriate test temperature...|$|R
50|$|The {{deformation}} resistant {{capacity of}} SMA {{stems from a}} coarse stone skeleton providing more stone-on-stone contact than with conventional <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt (DGA) <b>mixes</b> (see above picture).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the initial {{findings}} of an experimental program to design and assess the properties of recycled hot <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> asphalt <b>mixes.</b> The mixes include Size 14 -mm wearing course mix with and without recycled asphalt pavement (RAP). The RAP contents in the recycled mixes were 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %. Laboratory designs of the recycled mixes were conducted according to current Australian practice, which requires the use of a gyratory compactor to compact the mixes at 120 cycles and the use of lower-grade binder in mixes with > 15 % RAP content. The mixes, virgin and recycled, were designed to have similar blend gradations and acceptable film indices. The virgin and RAP aggregates were sourced from one supplier to ensure consistency throughout the project. Binder Grade C 320 was used for the virgin mix and for the mix with 10 % RAP. For the other two recycled <b>mixes,</b> a binder <b>grade</b> C 170 (lower viscosity) was used. Results from the limited laboratory design and testing program indicate that despite having similar blend gradations and acceptable design film index values, the mixes vary in most volumetric properties and in stiffness. However, this design approach proved to be successful in producing recycled mixes with up to 20 % RAP that meet specification requirements. Results also indicate that the addition of RAP leads to reduction in required binder content to achieve 4 % air voids content, also a reduction in the value of voids in mineral aggregate, voids filled with binder, and film index. Further, the addition of RAP results in a stiffer mix, and this effect increases with increasing RAP content...|$|R
40|$|Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SDHT) rely on dense-graded {{hot mix asphalt}} {{concrete}} mixes for construction and rehabilitation of asphalt pavement surfaced highways. As a result of increased commercial truck traffic on the provincial road network, {{over the last two}} decades, some of Saskatchewan’s recently placed <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> hot <b>mix</b> {{asphalt concrete}} (HMAC) pavements have been observed to show a susceptibility to premature permanent deformation in the asphalt mix. One of the aggregate properties thought to have significant influence on mix performance under traffic loading is the shape of the aggregate. Specifically, the physical properties of the fine aggregate (smaller than 5 mm in diameter) are of particular importance in <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> <b>mixes.</b> Although empirical evidence suggests that there are performance benefits associated with using angular fine aggregate, the relationship of this parameter on mechanistic mix performance and resistance to permanent deformation has not yet been clearly defined. The primary objective of this research was to conduct laboratory analysis to determine the physical, empirical, and mechanistic behaviour sensitivity to the proportion of manufactured and natural fine aggregate in SDHT Type 72 hot mix asphalt concrete. The second objective of this research was to compare the mechanistic behaviour of the Type 72 mixes considered in this research to conventional SDHT Type 70 structural hot mix asphalt concrete. Physical and mechanistic properties of a SDHT Type 72 mix at levels of 20, 40, and 60 percent manufactured fines as a portion of total fines (smaller than 5 mm), and for a SDHT Type 70 mix (which contained 38 percent manufactured fines) were evaluated. Ten repeat samples were compacted for each mix using 75 -blow Marshall compaction, and ten samples for each mix were compacted using the Superpave™ gyratory compaction protocols. Marshall stability and flow testing was conducted on the Marshall-compacted samples. Triaxial frequency sweep testing was conducted on the gyratory-compacted samples using the Rapid Triaxial Tester (RaTT) at 20 °C. The testing was conducted at axial loading frequencies of 10 and 0. 5 Hz, and at deviatoric stress states of 370, 425, and 500 kPa, respectively. The resulting dynamic modulus, axial and radial microstrains, Poisson’s ratio, and phase angle were evaluated. The research hypothesis stated that the increased amount of manufactured fines improves mechanistic properties of the Type 72 mix under typical field state conditions, and Type 72 mix with increased manufactured fines can exhibit mechanistic properties equivalent to or exceeding those of a typical type 70 mix. Based on the improved densification properties, increased Marshall stability, increased dynamic modulus, and reduced radial and axial strains, it was demonstrated that increasing manufactured fines content in the SDHT Type 72 mix does improve the mechanistic properties of this dense-graded asphalt mix. It should be noted that {{there appears to be a}} minimum level of manufactured fines content that is required to affect mix response to loading, and that this threshold lies somewhere between 40 and 60 percent manufactured fines content for the Type 72 mix tested as part of this research. Further, the Type 72 mix exhibited comparable or improved mechanistic properties relative to the Type 70 mix, which SDHT consider a structural mix. This is illustrated by the Type 72 mix with 60 percent manufactured fines resulting in higher Marshall stability and dynamic modulus, and lower axial microstrains than the Type 70 mix evaluated in this study. It is recommended that other Type 72 and Type 70 mixes are evaluated using similar testing protocols. In addition, field test sections should be used to further verify the research hypothesis investigated here. Economic analysis indicates that substantial savings in life cycle costs of SHDT asphalt concrete surfaced roadways can be realized by engineering well-performing, rut-resistant mixes. The life cycle costs can be reduced annually by approximately $ 7. 4 million, which translates into $ 102. 5 million savings over 18 years, during which the entire pavement network would be resurfaced with well-performing asphalt concrete mixes. Further, enhanced crushing of smaller aggregate top size decreases the amount of rejected material, and increases manufactured fines to coarse aggregate ratio, resulting not only in better engineering properties, but also in the optimized use of the province’s diminishing gravel resources. Pressures on aggregate sources are also reduced by improving life cycle performance of Saskatchewan asphalt concrete pavements. The total potential aggregate savings that can be realized by implementing well-performing Type 72 HMAC mixes amount to 4. 3 million metric tonnes of aggregate in the next 42 years. These aggregate savings can help decrease the predicted shortage of aggregate between 2007 and 2049 by approximately 6 percent. The total potential cost savings after 18 years of paving 500 km per year with rut-resistant, well-performing HMAC mixes amount to $ 112. 4 million in present value dollars. The 42 year savings amount to $ 193. 7 million in present day dollars. It is recommended that a more detailed economic analysis be carried out...|$|R

To address a number of perceived performance issues, {{since the start of the}} 21 st century, airport asphalt in Australia has often included premium binders. There is a perception of a reduction in performance of binders in Australia and overseas. Aircraft and their operation at major airports have also become ever more severe with continued growth in wheel loads and tyre pressures. The field performance of airport asphalt has been questioned with a number of failures being well documented. Binder comprises only 5 - 6 % of the mass of airport-quality asphalt. However, its influence on the performance of the mixture cannot be disputed. This critical element of this mix is, however, one of the least transparently monitored elements. Aggregates are subject to an array of independent testing and petrographic analysis, quarry faces are inspected and source rock approved ahead of time. Bitumen, by contrast, is required only to pass through empirical ‘gates’ for viscosity and other parameters, which vary for different grades and binder types. In an effort to improve airport asphalt’s field performance a new proprietary binder was developed called JetBind. JetBind was developed to meet the specific demands of airport pavements in Australia’s generally hot climate. The high temperature/high shear performance of the JetBind was compared to that of commonly specified products. Comparisons were made using the USA’s Performance Grading test known as the Multiple Stress Creep Recovery protocol for the Dynamic Shear Rheometer.

Attempting to “coarsen” the mix to allow for more asphalt or to make the mix more rut resistant often has an adverse effect.

Modified Class D HMA was found to perform better than <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> HMA at resisting fatigue cracking but is susceptible to failure by raveling or stripping. When compared to <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> HMA in eastern Washington Modified Class D HMA was found to have a shorter service life. Much of the reduction in service life was due to two early failing Modified Class D HMA projects on I- 90.

40|$|Abstract — Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) is a gap <b>graded</b> <b>mix,</b> {{characterized}} by high coarse aggregates, high asphalt contents and polymer or fiber additives as stabilizers. In comparison to <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures SMA has {{higher proportion of}} coarse aggregate, lower proportion of middle size aggregate and higher proportion of mineral filler. It resists permanent deformation and {{has the potential for}} long term performance and durability. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the resilient properties of mixtures of stone matrix asphalt made with two types of conventional binders namely bitumen 80 / 100 and 60 / 70, with 0. 3 % by weight of a non – conventional natural fiber, namely coconut fiber. The mixes are subjected to both static and repeated load indirect tensile strength tests. It is observed that the natural fibres have propounding effect on the resilient properties of the mixes.

40|$|Coal-based {{thermal power}} {{plants have been}} a key source of power {{generation}} in India. The prime waste product of a coal thermal power plant are fly ash and bottom ash. Heavy dumping of these waste products causes fatal environment pollution to air, water, and land, besides impairing human health. This research work is done to deliver the optimum use of ash, namely bottom ash as fine aggregate and fly ash as mineral filler with natural fiber (such as sisal fiber) used to improvise the engineering properties of bituminous paving mixes. For national interest these waste products, which are available easily and abundantly cane be used economically for bituminous paving purpose, which ultimately helps in saving the natural aggregate resources of the nation. In the present study, <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> bituminous <b>mix</b> specimens are prepared using natural aggregate as coarse aggregates, bottom ash as fine aggregates, fly ash as filler and sisal fiber as additive. Proportion of aggregate for <b>dense</b> <b>graded</b> bituminous macadam (DBM) grading has been considered as per MORTH (2013) having nominal maximum aggregates size (NMAS) 26. 5 mm. To strengthen the mix, slow setting emulsion (SS 1) coated sisal fiber is added in varying percentage of 0, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 %, and 1 % by weight of the mix, with different length variations such as 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm. At the initial stage of the research, specimens were prepared with two types of paving bitumen i. e. VG 30 and VG 10, out of which the initial trials resulted better Marshall characteristics with VG 30 bitumen and hence was considered for subsequent study. Detailed study with Marshall test results {{were used to determine}} the marshal characteristics, optimum binder content and also optimum fiber content including the optimum length of fiber. Marshall stability as high as 15 kN was obtained with optimum bitumen content of 5. 57 %, with optimum fiber content of 0. 5 % with optimum fiber length of 10 mm. Further, for delivering the performances of the pavement, various performance tests were also conducted such as moisture susceptibility test, indirect tensile strength (ITS), creep test and tensile strength ratio of bitumen mixes. It is finally observed that not only satisfactory, but also much improved engineering properties result with coal ash as fine aggregate and filler, stabilized with natural sisal fiber duly coated with SS- 1 emulsion in advance. Utilization of non-conventional aggregate like coal ash and natural fiber together thus may help to find a new way of bituminous pavement construction. The coal ash dumping which is a serious concern to everyone in respect of its disposal and environmental pollution, can find one way for its reuse in an economical way by substituting natural resources of sand and stone dust...|$|R
