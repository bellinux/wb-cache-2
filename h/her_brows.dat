2500|$|The {{impact of}} Garbo's acting and screen {{presence}} quickly established her {{reputation as one}} of Hollywood's greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She [...] "lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips," [...] he says. [...] "Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> or a drooping of her lids. Worlds turned on her movements." ...|$|E
60|$|Frances Freeland raised <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> quizzically. She almost looked arch.|$|E
60|$|Helena {{looked at}} him, {{knitting}} <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> with misgiving and perplexity.|$|E
60|$|She {{paused and}} wiped <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> I sat still, and listened eagerly.|$|R
60|$|Then he saw {{the bandage}} about <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> and was very penitent.|$|R
60|$|To {{that prayer}} she offered no response. She sat bemused, <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> wrinkled.|$|R
60|$|At this Sylvia knit <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> a little, {{and looked}} disturbed.|$|E
60|$|She {{wrinkled}} <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> in {{a puzzled}} frown, and her colour deepened.|$|E
60|$|She paused {{with her}} lips pressed together, <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> a little knit.|$|E
60|$|The scarlet fired <b>her</b> temples, <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> darkening {{the skin}} under her bright hair.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} close to mine. I stooped forward and kissed <b>her</b> on <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|R
60|$|Widow {{passed her}} hand over <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> It was a space before she {{answered}} him.|$|R
60|$|Sadie {{was silent}} for a minute, {{knitting}} <b>her</b> <b>brows,</b> and then looked up.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun {{looked at}} Ursula with a masklike, expressionless face. Ursula knitted <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|E
60|$|Still {{she did not}} understand. A deep frown of puzzlement {{appeared}} between <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|E
60|$|A cloud {{came over}} <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> It annoyed <b>her</b> {{that he should}} thus parry her thrust.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>brow</b> {{was still}} bleeding. Presently Morel {{got up and}} came craning his neck towards her.|$|R
60|$|Her {{expression}} altered a trifle. A slight frown contracted <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> The {{expression of}} apprehension deepened.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} eyes to his, now deliciously wet. <b>Her</b> <b>brows</b> were delicately uplifted.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>brows</b> were knit. She {{seemed to}} be {{listening}} {{for the sound of}} the unlocking gate.|$|E
60|$|Again {{the girl}} {{glanced at him}} sharply, with a faint but {{perceptible}} arching of <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{passed her}} hand over <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> {{to get rid of}} a feeling of unreality.|$|R
60|$|She {{gazed at}} me in a long, {{lingering}} sort of way, <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> wrinkled as if in thought.|$|R
60|$|He {{carefully}} {{stretched out}} his hand to feel, as he spoke, and laid a finger on <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|R
60|$|She faced him fully, a frown of perplexity {{bringing}} <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> together {{above her}} troubled eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him keenly, inquiringly, a deep line of doubt, even of fear now {{settling}} between <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|E
60|$|Carrie Denham flushed crimson, and <b>her</b> <b>brows</b> {{straightened}} ominously, but she restrained herself, and laughed, {{a little}} bitter laugh.|$|E
60|$|Alick's {{response}} was to bend over her, and kiss <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> She {{had never seen him}} so much gratified.|$|R
60|$|Maggy at {{the range}} rammed down a greyish mass beneath {{bubbling}} suds twice with her potstick and wiped <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{that you}} say, Tommy?" [...] {{interrupted}} old Martha, putting {{her hand to}} her ear and wrinkling <b>her</b> <b>brow</b> interrogatively.|$|R
60|$|She knit <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b> The wily Spaniard fenced {{so closely}} {{that there was}} no {{alternative}} but to come to grips.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} suddenly. <b>Her</b> <b>brows</b> {{met in a}} frown of bewilderment. Clearly this {{interested}} her. Again was she drawn.|$|E
60|$|Dame Charter turned {{upon the}} girl {{a look of}} kind compassion, {{but at the same}} time she knit <b>her</b> <b>brows.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My gracious lady ... my {{beautiful}} Sue ..." [...] he murmured whilst he covered <b>her</b> hands, <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> <b>her</b> hair with ardent kisses, [...] "you have come so late--and I {{have been so}} weary of waiting ... waiting for you." ...|$|R
60|$|Albinia slowly rose, and put {{her hand}} to <b>her</b> <b>brow,</b> as though {{confused}} with the tissue of deceit and double dealing.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Stanhope {{passed her}} hand over <b>her</b> <b>brow.</b> Tom's blunt words did much to {{counteract}} Josiah Crabtree's strange influence over her.|$|R
