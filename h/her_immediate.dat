As {{the only member of}} <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> family with United States citizenship, she {{remained}} in the U.S. when her parents and older brother were deported back to Colombia when she was 14. Her parents had pursued legal citizenship, but their representation failed them.|$|E
5|$|As Sovereign, Victoria {{used the}} royal {{coat of arms}} of the United Kingdom. Before her accession, she {{received}} no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} went by with further childlessness, Ernest became more distant to his wife, and was {{continually}} unfaithful. Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted, choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of, her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> family. By 1859, after seventeen years of childlessness, Ernest took no further interest in his wife.|$|E

5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy to an abrupt end. Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred {{the distinction between the}} idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E

5|$|The monarch {{and his or}} <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> family {{undertake}} various official, ceremonial, {{diplomatic and}} representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over {{the government of the}} United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E
5|$|A visibly {{pregnant}} McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and {{claiming to have}} abdominal pains.

Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> reinstatement.

5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint, which begins with popular devotion {{and is only}} later recognized by the Church, support for Richard began outside <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
5|$|When the Latter Day Saints {{began to}} migrate west in 1846, James {{prepared}} {{to move as}} well. Although many of <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> family members, including her mother, three brothers, and two sisters, had joined the church, {{she was the only}} one who chose to move West with the main body of saints from Nauvoo. At the time of the James family's departure, she was pregnant with a second son, Silas James, who was born at Hogg Creek, Iowa in June 1846. James, her husband Isaac, and Sylvester were part of the original group of Latter Day Saints to spend the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. They were also part of the Ira Eldredge company, the first Mormon pioneer company to enter the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. At the time of their settlement in the Salt Lake Valley, they made up a third of the 12 African Americans living in Utah, and were the only ones who were free.|$|E

25|$|When completed, the Deanery {{had been}} {{transformed}} from its origins as a simple Victorian cottage into a sprawling, 46-room mansion. It was an elegant residence where M.

5|$|Olga was {{genuinely}} popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> patronages included the Amalieion orphanage {{founded by the}} previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support {{and the support of}} wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors, including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.|$|E

25|$|The new Empress cared {{more for}} Saint Petersburg than <b>her</b> <b>immediate</b> predecessors; she re-established the Imperial court at the Winter Palace and, in 1732, Saint Petersburg again officially {{replaced}} Moscow as Russia's capital, a position {{it was to}} hold until 1918.|$|E
60|$|With all her good-nature the Duchess was a stern disciplinarian, taking {{herself and}} her duties very seriously.
