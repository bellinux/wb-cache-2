[...] "In Bloom" [...] {{was one of}} the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California; Vig thought it would be good to start recording a song previously recorded at Smart Studios. The arrangements for [...] "In Bloom" [...] and the other songs previously recorded with Vig in 1990 were largely unchanged; the recently hired drummer Dave Grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor Chad Channing had recorded, but added more power and precision to the recording. Cobain sang progressively [...] "harder" [...] during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the <b>input</b> <b>level</b> [...] "on the fly" [...] and hoped that Cobain would not [...] "change the phrasing or do something different" [...] while recording.|$|E

Economic researchers {{to date have}} analyzed these two decisions separately, either finding the best land use, given crop technologies, or solving for optimal <b>input</b> <b>levels,</b> ignoring the allocation of land. We show that both these approaches lead to suboptimal decision rules under risk aversion. An empirical example demonstrates that a risk-averse farmer who makes these decisions sequentially-first choosing <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> then allocating land-rather than simultaneously, may significantly understates the value of farming.

40|$|Current {{estimates}} of soil C storage potential {{are based on}} models or factors that assume linearity between C <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> and C stocks at steady-state, implying that SOC stocks could increase without limit as C <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> increase. However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing C <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} {{for determining the}} optimal levels of multilevel perturbation signals for nonlinear system identification, using condition numbers of submatrices of the Vandermonde matrix of the <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> vector. It is applicable when the perturbation signal is applied directly to a static nonlinearity. Optimal levels can be obtained for every order of nonlinearity less {{than the number of}} levels, and in most cases the optimal levels are not all distinct. The results show that there is no advantage in using signals with more than the minimum necessary number of distinct levels, although it may be advantageous if some of the distinct levels appear more than once in the <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> vector. The optimal levels are unchanged by multiple occurrences of every <b>level</b> of the <b>input</b> <b>levels</b> vector during a measurement period, and they are shown to be the global optima for pseudorandom perturbation signals derived from maximum-length sequences, in which the occurrence of the zero level is one less than the occurrences of the other levels during a period...|$|R
