5|$|A {{week later}} the whale was found dead, {{floating}} out at sea. It was towed to Stonehaven and dragged onto the beach. John Struthers, the Regius professor of Anatomy at Aberdeen, quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale {{and had it}} transported to <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone in <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} December 1883, a {{humpback}} whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers {{was not able to}} start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been told and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> in Washington.|$|E
5|$|The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston moved <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 {{when the}} yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug propulsion systems. The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than the lock could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in the lock, resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E
5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> on a summer day.|$|E
50|$|Sharing {{the field}} in 1963 with such players as Johnny Unitas, and now coached by Don Shula, Harris {{returned}} 8 kicks for 198 yards, including a 41-yard run. <b>His</b> <b>yards</b> per return, 24.8, were eclipsed only by John Mackey's.

50|$|The {{first half}} of the season saw Cobourne leading the league in rushing with 715 yards and, when {{combined}} with <b>his</b> 463 <b>yards</b> receiving, put him on a record pace to become the first player in league history to register 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season. However, due to injury, Cobourne finished the regular season with 145 carries for 950 yards with six touchdowns and 64 receptions for 607 yards for two touchdowns. Cobourne was named an East Division All-Star at running back while <b>his</b> rushing <b>yards</b> was third in the CFL, <b>his</b> receiving <b>yards</b> were 24th in the CFL, and <b>his</b> 1,557 <b>yards</b> from scrimmage was third in the CFL.|$|R

25|$|The last ship {{built by}} William H. Webb was the {{steamship}} Charles H. Marshall, fittingly named after Webb's most longstanding customer, who had awarded Webb his first subcontract {{as an apprentice}} {{more than thirty years}} earlier. Webb, who by this time had concluded that iron-hulled ships were the industry's future, closed <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> permanently in 1869. The yard had built 133 ships between 1840 and 1865—more than any other American shipyard over the same period—135 ships in total.|$|E
25|$|In September 1810, Eckford took on 16-year-old Isaac Webb as an {{apprentice}} at <b>his</b> <b>yard.</b> In the following years, Eckford would take on many other apprentices who would become important naval architects and shipbuilders in their own right, including Jacob Bell, William Bennett, David Brown, Andrew Craft, John Dimon, John Englis, Thomas Megson, Stephen Smith, and Sidney Wright. In thus spreading naval architecture and shipbuilding expertise, Eckford made {{a significant contribution to}} the growth of American shipbuilding.|$|E

25|$|By 1855, {{the gold}} rush was over and Westervelt, like other shipbuilders, began looking for new markets to keep <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> busy, as the {{shipping}} lines that had carried almost 2.7million emigrants across the Atlantic by sailing vessels between 1846–1855,were ordering fewer ships than before. The declining trend continued because of {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War in 1861. Between 1855 {{and the end of the}} war in 1865, only 1.4million emigrants were conveyed from Europe to the United States.|$|E
25|$|By 1855, {{the gold}} rush was over, and Webb began looking for new markets to keep <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> busy. In 1859, he {{completed}} the steam frigate General Admiral for the Imperial Russian government—the fastest steam frigate then afloat. In 1860 he contracted with the Italian government {{for the construction of}} two ironclads, Re d'Italia and Re Don Luigi di Portogallo, but because of the outbreak of the American Civil War, these vessels were not completed until 1863 and 1864 respectively. Both vessels were to participate in the Battle of Lissa between Italy and Austria in 1866.|$|E
25|$|A 1935 {{article in}} Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed {{interest}} in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not have money to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903 Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} to New York City, Eckford quickly {{became involved in}} naval design and construction at <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> there. The market for such ships was depressed after the war, however, so {{he took a job}} with the Navy as chief naval constructor at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1817, which he probably viewed as a temporary position until the market improved for privately built ships. While there, he and his apprentice Isaac Webb oversaw construction of the schooner , launched in 1821 and considered one of the fastest schooners of the day until she capsized and sank in a storm with the loss of all hands off Charleston, South Carolina, in 1843.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Gacy and an {{employee}} of PDM Contractors traveled to Florida to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night the two were alone in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room. As a result, this youth refused {{to stay in the}} same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy's house as he was in <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and beat him. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the youth from further attacking Gacy and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality work.|$|E
