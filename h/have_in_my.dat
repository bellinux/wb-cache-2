[...] "I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being will ever know of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E

I'll be very pleased if the vision I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head becomes a reality." [...] Although she told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have [...] "darker elements" [...] in Prism {{following the end of}} her marriage, Perry revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented [...] "I felt very prismatic", which inspired the album's name. [...] "Roar" [...] was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013. It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Unconditionally" [...] was released as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013, and peaked at number 14 in the United States.|$|E

[...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in London, Huxley {{consulted}} with every {{expert on the}} brain that he knew, and that included Flower. His conclusions were made public in 1860 in lectures and publications, {{but most of the}} demonstrations were done by Flower using monkey brains rather than the scarce ape brains. Over the years, Flower published papers on the brains of four species of monkey, and acted as Huxley's partner in demonstrations at subsequent BA meetings. At the 1862 meeting in Cambridge when Owen read a paper maintaining his claims, Flower stood up and said [...] "I happen to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket a monkey's brain"– and produced the object in question!

2500|$|There are, however, {{important}} {{cases where}} Webern {{may have even}} more profoundly influenced Schoenberg. Haimo marks the swift, radical influence in 1909 of Webern's novel and arresting Five Pieces for String Quartet, op. 5, on Schoenberg's subsequent piano piece op. 11 no. 3; Five Pieces for Orchestra, op. 16; and monodrama Erwartung, op. 17. This shift is distinctly pronounced in a letter Schoenberg wrote to Busoni, which describes a rather Webernian aesthetic: [...] "Harmony is expression and nothing else. [...] Away with Pathos! Away with protracted ten-ton scores [...] My music must be brief. Concise! In two notes: not built, but [...] "expressed"!! And the results I wish for: no stylized and sterile protracted emotion. People are not like that: {{it is impossible for}} a person to have only one sensation at a time. One has thousands simultaneously. [...] And this variegation, this multifariousness, this illogicality which our senses demonstrate, the illogicality presented by their interactions, set forth by some mounting rush of blood, by some reaction of the senses or the nerves, this I should like to <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music." [...] In 1949 Schoenberg still remembered being [...] "intoxicated by the enthusiasm of having freed music from the shackles of tonality" [...] and believing with his pupils [...] "that now music could renounce motivic features and remain coherent and comprehensible nonetheless".|$|E

2500|$|Fronto {{never became}} Marcus' {{full-time}} teacher, and continued {{his career as}} an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes. Fronto had been retained as defense counsel by Tiberius Claudius Demostratus, a prominent Athenian. Herodes Atticus was chief prosecutor. Because of Herodes' fraught relationship {{with the city of}} Athens, the defense's strategy would probably include attacks on his character. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with [...] "advice", then as a [...] "favor", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), but allowed that Marcus might be correct, and agreed that the case should not be made into a spectacle. He nonetheless affirmed his intent {{to make use of the}} material available: [...] "I warn you that I won't even use in a disproportionate way the opportunity that I <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> case, for the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If I happen to call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death." [...] Marcus was satisfied with Fronto's response.|$|E
