40|$|Background: Vertebral {{compression}} fractures {{occur in}} the thoracolumbar junction, causing {{the collapse of the}} vertebral body. For their treatment, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are used, but it is still unknown which technique is to be preferred. Methods: Finite element models of the thoracic spine were developed to evaluate the outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. A mild and severe collapse of T 10 treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty was studied. Stresses on the endplates and <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> were extrapolated to determine the stress distribution in the adjacent structures. Results: The validation ensured a correct stiffness and a proper kinematic of each functional spinal unit.

40|$|Background: Approximately 40 % of {{low back}} pain cases are {{attributed}} to internal disc disruption. Since mechanical loading directly affects <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and the stresses that the inner annulus fibrosus experiences, the mechanism that leads to disruption of the inner annulus fibrosus {{may be linked to}} changes in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> Hence, {{there is a need to}} examine how <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> changes over time during a flexion extension cyclic (FEC) loading protocol known to induce internal disc disruption. Purpose: 1) To determine whether a bore-screw pressure sensor system could be used as an alternative sensor for measuring <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> and 2) to characterize changes in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> moments, and axial deformation using a FEC loading protocol. Study 1 summary: Technical specifications of the bore-screw pressure sensor system were compared to the needle pressure sensor. The error projected at a static compressive load of 1500 N was approximately eight percent and the bore-screw pressure sensor had an excellent dynamic response compared to the needle pressure sensor. Study 2 methods: The bore-screw pressure sensor system was successfully instrumented in 14 porcine specimens. The FEC loading protocol consisted of 3600 cycles of 1 Hz flexion-extension movement while applying a 1500 N compressive load. The four dependent variables collected were <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> moment, axial deformation, and angular displacement. Study 2 results: <b>Intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and specimen height decreased by 45 % and 62 %, respectively, and the peak moment increased by 102 % following the FEC loading protocol. There were strong correlations between average <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and both peak moment and average axial deformation. The angle where maximum pressure occurred demonstrated a significant difference after 2700 cycles. There were no sequential changes in pressure difference after 2100 cycles. Twelve out of 14 specimens showed partial herniation (85. 7 %); however, the injury type was not correlated to the pressure change. Conclusions: Changes in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> were successfully characterized over time using a new pressure sensor system. Although the change in pressure difference was not predictive of an injury type, its increasing trend over time suggested that the inner annulus fibrosus failure mechanism may be related to fatigue. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Loading of the {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) alters biomechanical properties by modifying fluid {{distribution in the}} nucleus pulposus –changing hydrostatic pressure and tissue response – during force transmission along the spine. This study combines pressure, vertical displacement, and radial bulge measurements to assess biomechanical function during healthy and adverse loading of ovine lumbar motion segments. High compressive loads and simultaneous transient exertions, representative of obesity or other high-load lifestyles, are expected to limit fluid recovery and inhibit IVD biomechanical function compared to low compressive load controls with similar transient exertions. Specifically, the adverse group will (1) lose the ability to generate <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> equivalent to control discs at equal loads and (2) exhibit {{a greater degree of}} deformation and bulge during comparable loading.

40|$|A new {{decompression}} table system applying fifteen 60 second tractions of {{just over}} one half body weight in twenty one-half hour sessions was reported to give good or excellent relief of sciatic and back pain in 86 % of 14 patients with herniated discs and 75 % of patients with facet joint arthrosis. (Shealy, C. N.,Borgmeyer, V., AMJ. Pain Management 1997, 7 : 63 - 65). Herniated and degenerated discs can be shown at discography-discomanometry to have elevated <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> made even worse by sitting and standing, thus preventing proper disc nutrition. Therefore decompressing the over pressurized disc should allow for healing and repair of disc prolapse, herniation and annulus tears.

After fracture vertebroplasty was performed, {{four times in the}} same frac-tured vertebra. The injected cement volume was 5 % of the fractured vertebral volume to reach 5, 10, 15 and 20 % of cement fill. Biomechanical testing was performed before the fracture, after the fracture and after each cement injection.

40|$|The {{immature}} disc {{nucleus pulposus}} (NP) consists of notochordal cells (NCs). With maturation NCs disappear in humans, {{to be replaced}} by chondrocyte-like mature NP cells (MNPCs); this change in cell phenotype coincidences with early signs of disc degeneration. The reasons for NC disappearance are important to understand disc degeneration, but remain unknown, yet. This study investigated, whether loading induced a change from a notochordal nucleus phenotype to a chondrocyte-like one. An in vivo disc compression model with fixateur externe was used in 36 mature rabbits. Discs were compressed for different time periods (1, 28, 56  days), and compared with uncompressed control discs (56  days without treatment), and discs with sham compression (28  days). Nucleus cell phenotype was determined by histology and immunohistochemistry. NCs, but not MNPCs highly expressed bone-morphogenetic-protein 2 and cytokeratin 8, thus NC and MNPC numbers could be determined. A histologic score was used to detect structural endplate changes after compression (28  days). Control and sham compressed discs contained around 70 % NCs and 30 % MNPCs, to be decreased to 50 % after 28 – 56  days of compression (P <  0. 05 vs. controls). Signs of decreased endplate cellularity and increased endplate sclerosis and fibrosis were found after loading. These experiments show that NCs were less resistant to mechanical stress than MNPCs suggesting that increased <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> after loading, and limited nutrition through structurally altered endplates could instigate the disappearance of NCs...|$|R
30|$|Acute herniations {{occur in}} the early stage of {{degenerative}} disease when <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> is still relatively high. Acute increases in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> {{in the setting of}} trauma or lifting heavy weights lead to the displacement of the nucleous pulposus through the compromised fibres of the annulus fibrosus, causing the annulus fibrosus fibres to rupture. Injured tissues show increased levels of catabolic cytokines and an acute focal inflammatory reaction [29]. Every episode of acute disc displacement leads to further migration of the nucleous pulposus posteriorly and worsening of the annulus fibrosus tear. Herniation without disc degeneration is rarely seen and typically occurs secondary to an acute traumatic event (Fig.  15 a).|$|E
40|$|Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are routine {{treatments}} for compression fractures of vertebral bodies. A wedge-shaped compression fracture shifts {{the centre of}} gravity of the upper body anteriorly and generally, this shift can be compensated in the spine and in the hips. However, it is still unclear how a wedge-shaped compression fracture of a vertebra increases forces in the trunk muscle and the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> in the adjacent discs. A nonlinear finite element model of the lumbar spine was used to estimate the force in the trunk muscle, the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and the stresses in the endplates in the intact spine, and after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty treatment. In this study, kyphoplasty represents a treatment with nearly full fracture reduction and vertebroplasty one without restoration of kyphotic angle although in reality kyphoplasty does not guarantee fracture reduction. If no compensation of upper body shift is assumed, the force in the erector spine increases by about 200 % for the vertebroplasty but by only 55 % for the kyphoplasty compared to the intact spine. <b>Intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> increases by about 60 and 20 % for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. In contrast, with shift compensation of the upper body, the increase in muscle force is much lower and increase in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> is only about 20 and 7. 5 % for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. Augmentation of the vertebral body with bone cement has a much smaller effect on <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> The increase in that case is only about 2. 4 % for the intact {{as well as for}} the fractured vertebra. Moreover, the effect of upper body shift after a wedge-shaped vertebral body fracture on <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and thus on spinal load is much more pronounced than that of stiffness increase due to cement infiltration. Maximum von Mises stress in the endplates of all lumbar vertebrae is also higher after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. Cement augmentation has only a minor effect on endplate stresses in the unfractured vertebrae. The advantages of kyphoplasty found in this study will be apparent only if nearly full fracture reduction is achieved. Otherwise, differences between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty become small or vanish. Our results suggest that vertebral body fractures in the adjacent vertebrae after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are not induced by the elevated stiffness of the treated vertebra, but instead the anterior shift of the upper body is the dominating factor...|$|E
40|$|Interspinous {{implants}} {{are used}} to treat lumbar spinal stenosis or facet joint arthritis. The aims of implanting interspinous devices are to unload the facet joints, restore foraminal height and provide stability especially in extension but still allow motion. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare four different interspinous implants––Colfex, Wallis, Diam and X-Stop––in terms of their three-dimensional flexibility and the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> Twenty-four human lumbar spine specimens were divided into four equal groups and tested with pure moments in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation: (1) intact, (2) defect, (3) after implantation. Range of motion and the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> were determined. In each implant-group the defect caused an increase in range of motion by about 8 % in lateral bending to 18 % in axial rotation. Implantation had similar effects with all four implants. In extension, Coflex, Wallis, Diam, and X-Stop all overcompensated the instability caused by the defect and allowed about 50 % {{of the range of}} motion of the intact state. In contrast, in flexion, lateral bending and axial rotation the values of the range of motion stayed about the values of the defect state.

40|$|Intervertebral disc {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} wide ranges of <b>intradiscal</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> during different loading excercises and are at their minimum during lying or relaxed sitting and at maximum during lifting weights with a round back. We hypothesize that these different loading magnitudes influence the intervertebral disc (IVD) by alteration of disc matrix turnover depending on their magnitudes. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to assess changes in gene expression of human nucleus cells after the application of low hydrostatic pressure (0. 25  MPa) and high hydrostatic pressure (2. 5  MPa). IVD cells isolated from the nucleus of human (n =  18) and bovine (n =  24 from four animals) disc biopsies were seeded into three-dimensional collagen type-I matrices and exposed to the different loading magnitudes by specially developed pressure chambers. The lower pressure range (0. 25  MPa, 30  min, 0. 1  Hz) was applied with a recently published device by using an external compression cylinder. For the application of higher loads (2. 5  MPa, 30  min, 0. 1  Hz) the cell-loaded collagen gels were sealed into sterile bags with culture medium and stimulated in a newly developed water-filled compression cylinder by using a loading frame. These methods allowed the comparison of loading regimes in a wide physiological range under an equal three-dimensional culture conditions. Cells were harvested 24  h after the end of stimulation and changes in the expression of genes known to influence IVD matrix turnover (collagen-I, collagen-II, aggrecan, MMP 1, MMP 2, MMP 3, MMP 13) were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test 1 and a Wilcoxon 2 -sample test 2 were performed to detect differences between the stimulated and control samples 1 and differences between low and high hydrostatic pressure 2. Multiple testing was considered by adjusting the p value appropriately. Both regimes of hydrostatic pressure influenced gene expression in nucleus cells with opposite tendencies for the matrix forming proteins aggrecan and collagen type-I in response to the two different pressure magnitudes: Low hydrostatic-pressure (0. 25  MPa) tended to increase collagen-I and aggrecan expression of human nucleus cells (P <  0. 05) but only to a small degree. High hydrostatic pressure (2. 5  MPa) tended to decrease gene expression of all anabolic proteins with significant effects on aggrecan expression of nucleus cells (P =  0. 004). Low hydrostatic pressure had no influence on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP 1, MMP 2, MMP 3 and MMP 13). In contrast, high hydrostatic pressure tended to increase the expression of MMP 1, MMP 3 and MMP 13 of human nucleus cells with high individual-individual variations. The decreased expression of aggrecan (P =  0. 008) and collagen type II (P =  0. 023) and the increased MMP 3 expression (P =  0. 008) in response to high hydrostatic pressure could be confirmed in additional experiments with bovine nucleus cells. These results suggest that hydrostatic pressure as one of the physiological stimuli of the IVD may influence matrix turnover in a magnitude dependent way. Low hydrostatic pressure (0. 25  MPa) has quite small influences with a tendency to anabolic effects, whereas high hydrostatic pressure (2. 5  MPa) tends to decrease the matrix protein expression with a tendency to increase some matrix-turnover enzymes. Therefore, hydrostatic pressure may regulate disc matrix turnover in a dose-dependent way...|$|R
40|$|A {{bilateral}} {{dynamic stabilization}} device {{is assumed to}} alter favorable the movement and load transmission of a spinal segment without the intention of fusion of that segment. Little {{is known about the}} effect of a posterior dynamic fixation device on the mechanical behavior of the lumbar spine. Muscle forces were disregarded in the few biomechanical studies published. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how the spinal loads are affected by a bilateral posterior dynamic implant compared to a rigid fixator which does not claim to maintain mobility. A paired monosegmental posterior dynamic implant was inserted at level L 3 /L 4 in a validated finite element model of the lumbar spine. Both a healthy and a slightly degenerated disc were assumed at implant level. Distraction of the bridged segment was also simulated. For comparison, a monosegmental rigid fixation device as well as the effect of implant stiffness on intersegmental rotation were studied. The model was loaded with the upper body weight and muscle forces to simulate the four loading cases standing, 30 ° flexion, 20 ° extension, and 10 ° axial rotation. Intersegmental rotations, <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and facet joint forces were calculated at implant level and at the adjacent level above the implant. Implant forces were also determined. Compared to an intact spine, a dynamic implant reduces intersegmental rotation at implant level, decreases <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> in a healthy disc for extension and standing, and decreases facet joint forces at implant level. With a rigid implant, these effects are more pronounced. With a slightly degenerated disc intersegmental rotation at implant level is mildly increased for extension and axial rotation and <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> is strongly reduced for extension. After distraction, <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> values are markedly reduced only for the rigid implant. At the adjacent level L 2 /L 3, a posterior implant has only a minor effect on <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, it increases facet joint forces at this level for axial rotation and extension. Posterior implants are mostly loaded in compression. Forces in the implant are generally higher in a rigid fixator than in a dynamic implant. Distraction strongly increases both axial and shear forces in the implant. A stiffness of the implant greater than 1, 000  N/mm has only a minor effect on intersegmental rotation. The mechanical effects of a dynamic implant are similar to those of a rigid fixation device, except after distraction, when <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> is considerably lower for rigid than for dynamic implants. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that a dynamic implant does not necessarily reduce axial spinal loads compared to an un-instrumented spine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{stabilization}} of the lumbar spine has gained increasingly popularity. These nonfusion systems are alleged to maintain or restore the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> to magnitudes of the intact spine and have little {{negative effect on}} the adjacent segments to the stabilized one. Compliant Nitinol alloy (Ni-Ti) has been used in the manufacture of the rods of the dynamic stabilization systems. In this study, we investigated a dynamic stabilization system with its coiled rods made of Nitinol alloy. Four porcine lumbar spines (T 12 -L 6) were prepared: intact, fixed by a conventional rigid fixation system, fixed by a dynamic stabilization system with 2 -coiled rods, fixed by a dynamic stabilization system with 3 -coiled rods. Intradiscal pressures were measured at all levels before and after insertion of the implant. Our results show that the rigid stabilization system resulted in great changes of disc pressure in flexion and extension regardless of spinal levels. However, Intradiscal pressures (IDPs) remained relatively unchanged in models fixed by the dynamic stabilization systems. Changes in <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> can lead to altered metabolism within the disc, with potential long-term disc degeneration. These results suggest that the dynamic stabilization systems are superior over traditional fusion implants in maintaining the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> to the intact level at surgical level and adjacent level and can therefore be considered as an alternative method to fusion surgery in these indications while the intradical pressure is preserved...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{low back}} pain {{resulted}} from cyclic loadings is greater than that resulted from prolonged static postures. Disc degeneration results in degradation of disc solid structures and decrease of water contents, which is caused by activation of matrix digestive enzymes. The mechanical responses resulted from internal solid-fluid interactions of degenerative discs to cyclic loadings are not well studied yet. The fluid-solid interactions in discs can be evaluated by mathematical models, especially the poroelastic finite element models. We developed a robust disc poroelastic FE model to analyze the effect of degeneration on solid-fluid interactions within disc subjected to cyclic loadings at different loading frequencies. A backward analysis combined with in-vitro experiments were used to find the elastic modulus and hydraulic permeability of intact and enzyme-induced degenerated porcine discs. The {{results showed that the}} averaged peak-to-peak disc deformations during the in-vitro cyclic tests were well fitted with limited FE simulations and a quadratic response surface regression for both disc groups. The results showed that higher loading frequency increased the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> decreased the total fluid loss, and slightly increased the maximum axial stress within solid matrix. Enzyme-induced degeneration decreased the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and total fluid loss, and barely changed the maximum axial stress within solid matrix. The increase of <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and total fluid loss with loading frequency was less sensitive after the frequency elevated to 0. 1 Hz for the enzyme-induced degenerated disc. Based on this study, it is found that enzyme-induced degeneration decreases energy attenuation capability of disc, but less change the strength of disc...|$|E

40|$|Different {{strategies}} {{exist to}} treat intervertebral disc degeneration. Biological attempts to regenerate the disc are promising. However, degeneration of the disc is always accompanied by alterations of disc height, <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> load distribution, and motion patterns, respectively. Since those preconditions are independent factors for disc degeneration, {{it is unlikely}} that regeneration may occur without firstly restoring the physiological status of the affected spinal segment. In vitro and in vivo animal studies demonstrate that disc distraction normalizes intradiscal height and pressure. Furthermore, histological and radiological examinations provided some evidence for regenerative processes in the disc. Only dynamic stabilization systems currently offer the potential of a mechanical approach to intervertebral disc regeneration. Dynamic stabilization systems either using pedicle screws or with an interspinous device, demonstrate restabilization of spinal segments and reduction of <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> Clinical reports of patients with degenerative disc disease who underwent dynamic stabilization are promising. However, {{there is no evidence that}} those implants will lead to disc regeneration. Future treatment concepts should combine intradiscal cell based therapy together with dynamic restoration of the affected spinal segment...|$|E
40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a major}} problem in the industrialized world. The {{aetiology}} of LBP is multicausal: heavy physical workload, sedentary work, whole body vibration, smoking, as well as minimal influence over work conditions, poor social relations and psychological factors all play a dominant role (Thorbjornsson et al. 2000). Heavy physical workload is often cited as a primary factor, and is mostly related to an overload and high <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> of the intervertebral discs. After Nachemson measured intervertebral disc pressure in vivo in 1964 and found higher disc pressure in sitting, lifting and bending than in standing and lying down, most physicians concluded that high <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> e. g. from heavy workload, should be avoided. Because of low <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> during lying down, bed rest was the first choice in case of LBP, and recommendations for activities were restrictive. It is now evident that bed rest for longer than two days is ineffective in case of LBP (Deyo et al. 1986) and even leads to chronicity and disuse (Waddell 1993; Bortz 1984); there is now worldwide consensus about the value of maintaining or resuming normal activities and doing exercises of any kind (Koes et al. 2001). However, even today, it is common in routine medical practice, that physicians still tend to restrict rather than encourage physical activity and work for patients with LBP (Rainville et al. 2000). It is also remarkable that in daily practice it is not the extent of spinal load that may be most painful, but the lack of spinal motion. Most LBP patients say that: "I can easily do sports, cycling and walking, but sauntering, sitting and even lying down is painful". The controversy between the "spinal load" axiom and this clinical information from patients was the main incentive for the work presented in this thesis...|$|E
30|$|To prevent failure after {{intervertebral}} cage implantation in patients, {{knowledge about}} the minimum required load is warranted. The failure load of the MAC cages proved to be 2043 [*]N for the NiTi-l cage, and 1866 [*]N for the NiTi-s cage. The study of Wilke et al. (2001) measured <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> in a non-degenerated L 4 – 5 disc of a 45 [*]year old male volunteer and discovered that <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> depended {{on the kind of}} preceding activity, posture, external loads, and muscle activity (Wilke et al., 2001). Kandziora et al. (2002) reported that the L 4 -L 5 motion segment of a 80 [*]kg weighing patient could experience peak loads on the order of 2.24 kN (Kandziora et al., 2002). Regarding the results of failure load from our study, this suggests that a risk of failure under physiological loads is present. However, considering the use of only small size devices in this study and the additional biomechanical strength obtained from the bone graft and posterior stabilization with pedicle screws, the MAC cages might therefore still meet the threshold for short-term as well as long-term clinical stability. Future studies should be performed to prove this statement.|$|E
40|$|Discogenic pain is {{a leading}} cause of chronic low back pain. The authors {{investigated}} the efficacy of pressure-controlled discography to determine its role in clinical decision-making for the management of patients with discogenic pain. Pressure-controlled discography was performed in 21 patients (51 discs) with pain-provocation, followed by post-discography computerized tomography scans. Pain response was classified as positive response and negative response, and measured with visual analog scale scores. Discographic findings were graded by the modified Dallas discogram scale. Elastance, pain provocation on <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> pressure and volume of initial pain response, and pain response intensity were statistically analyzed. Elastance showed significant differences between Grade 0 and Grade 4 & 5. Decreased elastance with positive pain response group was a good indicator to imply that disc degeneration presumably is a pain generator. Results of pain response were well correlated with <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> but not with the amount of injected volume. Among 31 discs of Grade 4 and 5, 74 % showed negative pain response and 26 % showed positive response. It was concluded that pressure-controlled discography was useful to diagnose discogenic pain and excellent guide in decision-making for spinal operations...|$|E
40|$|Pre-clinical {{in vitro}} tests {{are needed to}} {{evaluate}} the biomechanical performance of new spinal implants. For such experiments large animal models are frequently used. Whether these models allow any conclusions concerning the implant’s performance in humans is difficult to answer. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether calf, pig or sheep spine specimens may be used to replace human specimens in in vitro flexibility and cyclic loading tests with two different implant types. First, a dynamic and a rigid fixator were tested using six human, six calf, six pig and six sheep thoracolumbar spine specimens. Standard flexibility tests were carried out in a spine tester in flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation in the intact state, after nucleotomy and after implantation. Then, the Coflex interspinous implant was tested for flexibility and <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> using another six human and six calf lumbar spine segments. Loading was carried out as described above in the intact condition, after creation of a defect and after implantation. The fixators were most easily implantable into the calf. Qualitatively, they had similar effects on ROM in all species, however, the degree of stability achieved differed. Especially in axial rotation, the ROM of sheep, pig and calf was partially less than half the human ROM. Similarly, implantation of the Coflex interspinous implant caused the ROM to either increase in both species or to decrease in both of them, however, quantitatively, differences were observed. This was also the case for the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> In conclusion, animal species, especially the calf, may be used to get a first idea of how a new pedicle screw system or an interspinous implant behaves in in vitro flexibility tests. However, the effects on ROM and <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> have to be expected to differ in magnitude between animal and human. Therefore, the last step in pre-clinical implant testing should always be an experiment with human specimens...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} body weight on <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> (IDP) and annulus stress of intervertebral discs at lumbar spine. Three-dimensional finite element model of osseoligamentous lumbar spine was developed subjected to follower load of 500 [*]N, 800 [*]N, and 1200 [*]N which represent the loads for individuals who are normal and overweight with the pure moments at 7. 5 [*]Nm in flexion and extension motions. It was observed that the maximum IDP was 1. 26 [*]MPa at L 1 -L 2 vertebral segment. However, the highest increment of IDP was found at L 4 -L 5 segment where the IDP was increased to 30 % in flexion and it was more severe at extension motion reaching to 80 %. Furthermore, the maximum annulus stress also occurred at the L 1 -L 2 segment with 3. 9 [*]MPa in extension motion. However, the highest increment was also found at L 4 -L 5 where the annulus stress increased to 17 % in extension motion. Based on these results, the increase of physiological loading could be an important factor to the increment of <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and annulus fibrosis stress at all intervertebral discs at the lumbar spine which may lead to early intervertebral disc damage...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLow {{back pain}} {{is a major}} public health problem in European Countries. In France, about 50 % of {{population}} is suffering of this pathology every year (Fassier 2011). Because of health care cost and sick leave (Fassier 2011; Leclerc et al. 2009), low back pain has both societal and economic adverse consequences. Many treatments are proposed. However no guideline is provided to physician. Treatment depends on patient, on low back pain type and evolution and also on physician knowledge and believes. Medical devices, as lumbar belt might be proposed to treat low back pain. Several clinical trials have shown their efficacy (Calmels et al. 2009). Nevertheless, both mechanical and physiological effects of lumbar belts remain unclear. In this study, {{the application of a}} lumbar belt on the trunk is simulated by a finite element model. It is often assumed that the pain comes from the toe of the intervertebral discs and is related only to the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and the thoracolumbar posture. Beside, abdominal pressure is used by belt manufacturers as a marker of the lumbar belt efficiency, because a change in the abdominal pressure could bring a change in the thoracolumbar posture and consequently on the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure.</b> That's why the goal {{of this study is to}} determine the mechanical effect of wearing lumbar belt: i) on abdominal pressure; ii) on thoracolumbar posture; iii) on intervertebral disc pressure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Finite element {{analysis}} results will show significant differences if the model used is performed under various material properties, geometries, loading modes or other conditions. This study adopted an FE model, {{taking into account}} the possible asymmetry inherently existing in the spine with respect to the sagittal plane, with a more geometrically realistic outline to analyze and compare the biomechanical behaviour of the lumbar spine with regard to the facet force and <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure,</b> which are associated with low back pain symptoms and other spinal disorders. Dealing carefully with the contact surfaces of the facet joints at various levels of the lumbar spine can potentially help us further ascertain physiological behaviour concerning the frictional effects of facet joints under separate loadings or the responses to the compressive loads in the discs. Methods A lumbar spine model was constructed from processes including smoothing the bony outline of each scan image, stacking the boundary lines into a smooth surface model, and subsequent further processing in order to conform with the purpose of effective finite element analysis performance. For simplicity, most spinal components were modelled as isotropic and linear materials with the exception of spinal ligaments (bilinear). The contact behaviour of the facet joints and changes of the <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> with different postures were analyzed. Results The results revealed that asymmetric responses of the facet joint forces exist in various postures and that such effect is amplified with larger loadings. In axial rotation, the facet joint forces were relatively larger in the contralateral facet joints than in the ipsilateral ones at the same level. Although the effect of the preloads on facet joint forces was not apparent, <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> did increase with preload, and its magnitude increased more markedly in flexion than in extension and axial rotation. Conclusions Disc pressures showed a significant increase with preload and changed more noticeably in flexion than in extension or in axial rotation. Compared with the applied preloads, the postures played a more important role, especially in axial rotation; the facet joint forces were increased in the contralateral facet joints as compared to the ipsilateral ones at the same level of the lumbar spine. </p...|$|E

However, only treatment of spinal stenosis is backed by acceptable clinical evidence. There are some in vitro biomechanical studies suggesting that interspinous implants can decrease <b>intradiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> and enlarge foramen size.
