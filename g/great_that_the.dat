5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship snaps in two.|$|E

An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed {{large amounts of money}} to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|The gas {{chambers}} {{worked to}} their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during {{the massacre of}} Hungary's Jews. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March. A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, {{at a rate of}} 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period. The incoming volume was so <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits {{as well as in the}} crematoria. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} modern period, {{successor}} states of the Adal and Ajuran empires began to flourish in Somalia, continuing the tradition of seaborne trade established by previous Somali empires.

During this period, the Somali agricultural output to Arabian markets was so <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coast of Somalia {{came to be known}} as the Grain Coast of Yemen and Oman.

He also taught in the yeshiva, and officiated as cantor, especially on the Day of Atonement. As he had a thorough knowledge of the Talmud, his decisions were often sought in halakic cases.|$|E

25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in arid zones, known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so <b>great</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E
