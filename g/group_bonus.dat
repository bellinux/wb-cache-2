40|$|Gainsharing is {{reported}} to greatly enhance organizational performance, {{but there is little}} empirical research that explains how gainsharing works and why companies adopt it. We employ a human resource control framework to examine the role gainsharing plays within the organization. Our analysis of 802 organizations suggests that gain-sharing plans are used to enhance employee participation in organizations that employ market-based control methods. Organizations that use bureaucratic or clan controls are not likely to adopt gainsharing; {{they are more likely to}} use participation initiatives that do not involve a <b>group</b> <b>bonus.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In primary care, {{financial}} incentives have usually been directed to physicians {{because they are}} thought to make the key decisions in order to change the functions of a medical organization. There are no studies regarding the impact that directing these incentives to all disciplines of the care team (e. g. <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> for both nurses and doctors) may have, despite the low frequency with which diagnoses were being recorded for primary care visits to doctors. This study tested the effect of offering <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> to the care teams. Methods This was a retrospective quasi-experimental study with before-and-after settings and two control groups. In the intervention group, the mean percentage of visits to a doctor for which a diagnosis was recorded by each individual care team (mean team-based percentage of monthly visits to a doctor with recorded diagnoses) and simultaneously the same data was gathered from two different primary care settings where no team bonuses were applied. To study the sustainability of changes obtained with the <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> the respective data were derived from the electronic health record system for 2  years after the cessation of the intervention. The differences {{in the rate of}} marking diagnoses was analyzed with ANOVA and RM-ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests, and the differences in the rate of change in marking diagnoses was analyzed with linear regression followed by t-test. Results The proportion of doctor visits having recorded diagnoses in the teams was about 55  % before starting to use <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> and 90  % after this intervention. There was no such increase in control units. The effect of the intervention weakened slightly after cessation of the <b>group</b> <b>bonuses.</b> Conclusion <b>Group</b> <b>bonuses</b> may provide a method to alter clinical practices in primary care. However, sustainability of these interventions may diminish after ceasing this type of financial incentive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective To {{improve the}} {{recording}} of diagnoses in visits to general practitioners, an observational retrospective study based on a before-after design was performed by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient chart system, reinforced in feedback delivered in superior-subordinate or development discussions with the general practitioners. The monthly rate of recording diagnoses was observed {{before and after the}} intervention. The effect of this intervention on recording of diagnoses was compared with the effects of financial <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> on the same parameter in a neighbouring city. Results Before intervention, the level of recording diagnoses was about 45 % in the primary care units. Nine months after this intervention there was not yet any statistically significant increase in recording of diagnoses but after 21  months it yielded a recording rate of 90 % (P <  0. 001). In three years, this percentage reached level over 95 %. <b>Group</b> <b>bonuses,</b> a financial incentive serving as a control intervention, increased this parameter from 50 to 80 % (P <  0. 001) in nine months, and in 21  months the level of recording diagnoses was 90 %. The both methods increased the level of recording diagnoses at the same level. <b>Group</b> <b>bonuses</b> acted faster but were also more expensive...|$|R
40|$|We use {{an online}} real-effort {{experiment}} to investigate how bonus-based pay and worker productivity interact with workplace cheating. Firms often use bonus-based compensation plans, such as <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> and firm-wide profit sharing, that induce considerable uncertainty {{in how much}} workers are paid. Exposing workers to a compensation scheme based on random bonuses makes them cheat more but {{has no effect on}} their productivity. We also find that more productive workers behave more dishonestly. These results are consistent with workers’ cheating behavior responding to the perceived fairness of their employer’s compensation scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{compare the}} {{feasibility}} and {{the profitability of}} group vs. individual performance pay when workers are envious and when verifiable signals on the workers’ performances are not available. The <b>group</b> <b>bonus</b> contract is superior {{as long as the}} principal faces no credibility problem. This {{is due to the fact}} that group performance pay avoids the occurrence of inequity. However, the relational individual bonus contract may become dominant although it introduces the prospect of unequal pay. The reason is that precisely the worker’s distaste for wage inequity may actually soften the principal’s credibility constraint...|$|E
40|$|Worker {{incentive}} schemes are invariably {{assumed to be}} administered by an owner-entrepreneur who has an incentive to understate worker performance after the event. While tournaments can overcome this problem, they discourage cooperation between workers. The authors show that a professional manager concerned with equality between workers and with avoiding bankruptcy rather than maximizing shareholder wealth will conduct a tournament that preserves individual effort incentives while promoting cooperation between workers. The theory predicts lower debt levels and more compressed pay scales as cooperation becomes more important. In the limit, this becomes a <b>group</b> <b>bonus</b> scheme supported by "blue-chip" debt. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} of Kleer Windows, a firm which {{manufactures}} doors and windows for the recreational vehicles industry argues that {{the influence of the}} work group can under certain conditions be harnessed by management in their attempts to control workers. Peer control exists when co- workers seek to monitor and influence each others level of productivity. Data were collected during three summers of ethnographic research. A comparison of the control systems utilized in the production, shipping, and receiving departments at Kleer Windows reveals that peer control is likely to stimulate, rather than inhibit, productivity when two conditions exist. First, when workers are motivated to monitor one another through an interdependence of reward - making the rewards of each worker dependent upon the effort and productivity of all co-workers as we 11 as the effort of the individual worker (i. e., {{through the use of a}} <b>group</b> <b>bonus</b> system) - peer control that stimulates productiuity is increasingly likely to develop. The second condition necessary for peer control is that workers be able to monitor each other through an interdependence of task - organizing work such that each worker is dependent upon co-workers for the successful completion of their work tasks (i. e., serial production) contributes to the establishment of peer control...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a concept of}} emotions that emerge when workers compare their own performance with a given standard or with the performances of co-workers. Assuming heterogeneity among the workers the interplay of emotions and incentives is analysed by focusing on three incentive schemes that are frequently used in practice: tournaments, bonuses and piece rates. We identify certain conditions under which emotions lead to additional incentives and under which the employer benefits from emotional workers. Furthermore, the concept of emotions is used to explain puzzling results from laboratory and field experiments. Finally, the results provide some insights on an employer's possible preferences in favor of heterogeneous instead of homogeneous work <b>groups.</b> <b>bonuses,</b> emotions, incentives, piece rates, tournaments...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} worker {{wellbeing}} is determined {{not only by}} the amount of compensation workers receive but also by how compensation is determined. While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, <b>group</b> <b>bonuses</b> and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the “gift”; we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as “bad” aspects of job quality...|$|R
30|$|In {{another study}} {{of the effects of}} work organisation, we have {{emphasised}} the importance of the broader concept of “employee involvement” for skills and skills development (Felstead et al. 2010). We focused on the idea of a “high-involvement” work organisation (e.g. Wood and Bryson 2009), incorporating in principle four aspects of involvement: employee involvement in decision-making about work tasks; appraisal feedback; systems designed to reward performance and improve motivation; and mechanisms for sharing information and knowledge through the organization. While other writers had focused on the impact of high involvement on firm performance and on wages, we were interested specifically in their effect on skill formation. Using Latent Class Analysis we categorised jobs by the extent of group and individual involvement in the organisation. High group involvement jobs were ones where there was a high probability of having a great deal of team or individual influence over work tasks, of there being good communication channels (suggestion schemes, quality circles, expressive meetings etc.), and of there being an individual or <b>group</b> <b>bonus</b> scheme. We developed indicators of the quality of training, according to workers’ reports of whether the training they received raised their work skills a lot, improved working practices, led to increased pay or more enjoyable work. We found that the quality of training was significantly greater in organisations that had high group involvement. We similarly found that high group involvement was robustly associated with the quality of the learning environment—as measured by the propensity to learn new things individually or in teams, and to help others learn.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} teamworking {{is the product}} of two {{distinct}} developments. One: a neo- Tayloristic form of organization of work, of which Toyota has shown that it can be very profitable, was packaged and reframed to make it acceptable to the Western public. Two: anti-Tayloristic ways of organizing work, inspired by ideals of organizational democracy, were relabeled to make these acceptable to profit-oriented managers. Drawing on empirical research in Scandinavia, Germany, The Netherlands and the UK, as well as on published case studies of Japanese companies, the paper develops a neo-Tayloristic and an anti-Tayloristic model of teamworking. Key concerns in the teamworking literature are intensification of work and the use of shop floor autonomy as a cosmetic or manipulative device. Indeed, all the features of neo-Tayloristic teamworking are geared towards the intensification of work. However, one of the intensification mechanisms, the removal of Tayloristic rigidities in the division of labor, applies to anti-Tayloristic teamworking as well. This poses a dilemma for employee representatives. In terms of autonomy, on the other hand, the difference between neo-Tayloristic and anti-Tayloristic teamworking is real. In anti-Tayloristic teamworking, there is no supervisor inside the team. The function of spokesperson rotates. All team members can participate in decision-making. Standardization is not relentlessly pursued; management accepts some measure of worker control. There is a tendency to alleviate technical discipline, e. g. to find alternatives for the assembly line. Buffers are used. Remuneration is based on proven skill level; there are no <b>group</b> <b>bonuses.</b> In contrast, in neo-Tayloristic teamworking, a permanent supervisor is present in the team as team leader. At most, only the team leader can participate in decision-making. Standardization is relentlessly pursued. Management prerogatives are nearly unlimited. Job designers treat technical discipline, e. g. short-cycled work on the assembly line, as unproblematic. There are no buffers. A substantial part of wages consists of individual bonuses based on assessments by supervisors on how deeply workers cooperate in the system. <b>Group</b> <b>bonuses</b> are also given. The instability and vulnerability of anti-Tayloristic teamworking imply that it can only develop and flourish when managers and employee representatives put determined effort into it. The opportunity structure for this contains both economic and political elements. In mass production, the economic success of Toyota, through skillful mediation by management gurus, makes the opportunity structure for anti-Tayloristic teamworking relatively unfavorable...|$|R
40|$|Teacher {{compensation}} schemes {{are often}} criticized for lacking a performance-based component. Proponents of merit pay argue that linking teacher salaries to student achievement will incentivize teachers {{to focus on}} raising student achievement and stimulate innovation across the school system as a whole. In this paper, we utilize a policy experiment conducted in the New York City public school system to explore the effects of one performance-based bonus scheme. We investigate potential impacts of group-based incentive pay over two academic years (2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009) {{on a range of}} outcomes including: teacher effort, student performance in math and reading, and classroom activities, measured through environmental surveys of teachers and students. We also explore impacts on the market for teachers by examining teacher turnover and the qualifications of newly hired teachers. Overall, we find the bonus program had little impact on any of these outcomes. We argue that the lack of bonus program impacts {{can be explained by the}} structure of the <b>bonus</b> program. <b>Group</b> <b>bonuses</b> led to free-riding, which significantly reduced the program’s incentives. Once we account for free-riding, we find evidence that the program led teachers to increase their effort through a significant reduction i...|$|R

40|$|We follow 822 {{applicants}} {{through the}} process of obtaining a driver%u 2019 s license in New Delhi, India. To understand how the bureaucracy responds to individual and social needs, participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups: bonus, lesson, and comparison groups. Participants in the <b>bonus</b> <b>group</b> were offered a financial reward if they could obtain their license fast; participants in the lesson group were offered free driving lessons. To gauge driving skills, we performed a surprise driving test after participants had obtained their licenses. Several interesting facts regarding corruption emerge. First, the bureaucracy responds to individual needs. Those who want their license faster (e. g. the <b>bonus</b> <b>group),</b> get it 40 % faster and at a 20 % higher rate. Second, the bureaucracy is insensitive to social needs. The <b>bonus</b> <b>group</b> does not learn to drive safely in order to obtain their license: in fact, 69 % of them were rated as %u 201 Cfailures%u 201 D on the independent driving test. Those in the lesson group, despite superior driving skills, are only slightly more likely to obtain a license than the comparison group and far less likely (by 29 percentage points) than the <b>bonus</b> <b>group.</b> Detailed surveys allow us to document the mechanisms of corruption. We find that bureaucrats arbitrarily fail drivers at a high rate during the driving exam, irrespective of their ability to drive. To overcome this, individuals pay informal %u 201 Cagents%u 201 D to bribe the bureaucrat and avoid taking the exam altogether. An audit study of agents further highlights the insensitivity of agents%u 2019 pricing to driving skills. Together, these results suggest that bureaucrats raise red tape to extract bribes and that this corruption undermines the very purpose of regulation. ...|$|R

Project 2 : Observation We propose a behavioural model of effort provision under a fixed wage payment scheme that accounts for competitive social preferences such as non-competitive self-esteem, competitive self-esteem and status-seeking. We designed and ran a sequence of controlled laboratory experiments that allow for the separation of these effects using four distinct combinations of relative performance feedback (explicit rank in a peer group) of three forms - none, computerised and personal, and either a private or a public information condition. All the data is collected using a real-effort task. Preliminary analysis reveals an important role for relative performance feedback in driving performance, despite the lack of tangible benefits.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects on {{immunization}} coverage of 3 incentives for physicians [...] a cash bonus for practice [...] wide increases, enhanced fee for service, and feedback. METHODS: Incentives were applied at 4 -month intervals over 1 year among 60 inner-city office-based pediatricians. At each interval, charts of 50 randomly selected children between 3 and 35 months of age were reviewed per physician. RESULTS: The percentage of children who were up to date for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b; polio; and measles-mumps-rubella immunization in the study's <b>bonus</b> <b>group</b> improved by 25. 3 percentage points (P <. 01). No significant changes occurred in the other groups. However, percentage of immunizations received outside the participating practice also increased significantly in the <b>bonus</b> <b>group</b> (P <. 01). Levels of missed opportunities to immunize were high in all groups and did not change over time. Physicians' knowledge of contraindications was low. CONCLUSIONS: Bonuses sharply and rapidly increased immunization cover-age in medical records. However, much of the increase was the result of better documentation. A bonus is a powerful incentive, but more structure or education may be necessary to achieve the desired results...|$|R
