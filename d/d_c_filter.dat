The influence of smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> and pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> discharge power on films thickness, crystallinity, surface morphology, photocatalytic activity (methylene blue degradation) and hydrophilic activity were studied. At pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> sputtering, plasma generator has been used to provide the asymmetric pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> bias of the target at 100 kHz and pulsed off-time 4016 ns. The structures of the films at 100 nm and 300 nm thick showed nano-grain size structure. The pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode deposition exhibited a considerably lower surface roughness, but higher grain size compared to the films deposited with the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode. At film thickness about 300 nm, the XRD peaks indicated that the dominant structure was anatase for which the preferred orientation was in (101) plane.

For the photocatalytic activity, it was clearly seen that the films deposited by smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode showed a higher photocatalytic activity. The hydrophilic activity test, after the films had been irradiated by an ultraviolet light source for 30 min., the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode films (thickness 300 nm) showed that a water contact angle can be less than 10 °.

40|$|Abstract. On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions. Moreover, it is well-known, and not difficult to show, that it is even an algebra and a lattice (see, e. g., [2, III. 2]). While an everywhere defined quotient g/f of two <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on a finite-dimensional Banach space is always <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> (cf.
