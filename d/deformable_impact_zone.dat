40|$|The New York Police Department (NYPD) under Operation Impact {{deployed}} extra {{police officers}} to high crime areas designated as <b>impact</b> <b>zones.</b> Officers were encouraged to conduct investigative stops in these areas. City officials credited the program {{as one of the}} leading causes of New York City's low crime rate. We tested the effects of Operation Impact on reported crimes and arrests from 2004 to 2012 using a difference-in-differences approach. We used Poisson regression models to compare differences in crime and arrest counts before and after census block groups were designated as <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> compared to census block groups in the same NYPD precincts but outside <b>impact</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were significantly associated with reductions in total reported crimes, assaults, burglaries, drug violations, misdemeanor crimes, felony property crimes, robberies, and felony violent crimes. <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were significantly associated with increases in total reported arrests, arrests for burglary, arrests for weapons, arrests for misdemeanor crimes, and arrests for property felony crimes. <b>Impact</b> <b>zones</b> were also significantly associated with increases in investigative stops for suspected crimes, but only the increase in stops made based on probable cause indicators of criminal behaviors were associated with crime reductions. The largest increase in investigative stops in <b>impact</b> <b>zones</b> was based on indicators of suspicious behavior that had no measurable effect on crime. The findings suggest that saturating high crime blocks with police helped reduce crime in New York City, but that the bulk of the investigative stops did not {{play an important role in}} the crime reductions. The findings indicate that crime reduction can be achieved with more focused investigative stops...|$|R

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 The Green <b>Impact</b> <b>Zone</b> of Missouri operated in Kansas City, Missouri from 2009 until 2014 {{as a national}} model for place-based investment. Missouri Congressman Emanuel Cleaver II is credited with pioneering the initiative, which was overseen for five years by the Kansas City metropolitan-area regional planning organization, the Mid-America Regional Council. During those five years, the Green <b>Impact</b> <b>Zone</b> directed about $ 166 million dollars into a 150 -square block area from 39 th Street to 51 st Street, including Troost and Prospect avenues as well as Emanuel Cleaver II Boulevard. The money came largely from federal funding made available {{in response to the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and went towards neighborhood infrastructure and investments in human capital, with an emphasis on environmental sustainability. The Green <b>Impact</b> <b>Zone</b> was designed to be highly visible, and it benefited to this end from public support from then-President Barack Obama and other White House personnel. When the initiative ultimately shut down in 2014 {{due to a lack of}} funding, it did so quietly, receiving much less fanfare in its final days than it did in its early days. The reputation of the Green <b>Impact</b> <b>Zone</b> is unclear at the present moment; although it was successful in raising significant investment in an area that badly needed it, it missed out on major sources of funding. Revitalization of these neighborhoods is a gradual process, and it remains to be seen how much the areas will change in the years following the Green <b>Impact</b> <b>Zone’s</b> efforts.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{occurred}} {{in spring and}} summer 2010 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Research cruises in 2010 (approximately 2 - 3 months after the well had been capped), 2011, and 2014 were conducted to determine the initial and subsequent effects of the oil spill on deep-sea soft-bottom infauna. A total of 34 stations were sampled from two zones: 20 stations in the "impact" zone versus 14 stations in the "non-impact" zone. Chemical contaminants were significantly different between the two zones. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons averaged 218 ppb in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> compared to 14 ppb in the non-impact zone. Total petroleum hydrocarbons averaged 1166 ppm in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> compared to 102 ppm in the non-impact zone. While {{there was no difference}} between zones for meiofauna and macrofauna abundance, community diversity was significantly lower in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone.</b> Meiofauna taxa richness over the three sampling periods averaged 8 taxa/sample in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone,</b> compared to 10 taxa/sample in the non-impact zone; and macrofauna richness averaged 25 taxa/sample in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> compared to 30 taxa/sample in the non-impact zone.

Case studies that had recent multifamily developments built near transit nodes or town centers were chosen. For each town, a conservative <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> around the multifamily development was established, and sales prices in this area were compared {{to those in the}} rest of the town. Using data on the sales of single-family homes from 1987 until 2005, regression analyses were used to construct hedonic price models for the impact and control areas. This model was used to create a sales price index over time. The trend in the index of the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> and the control area was compared in the years immediately preceding the permitting of the multifamily development and the years following completion of the development in order to determine if the multifamily development affected sales prices in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone.</b> In the four cases for which there was appropriate data, no negative effects in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> were found. by Arah Schuur.

40|$|This hydrogeophysical field {{experiment}} evaluated {{the ability of}} high frequency (450 & 900 MHz) ground penetrating radar (GPR) to characterize the release of gasoline over an annual cycle of in situ conditions. In August 2008, 200 liters of E 10 gasoline were released into the unconfined sand aquifer at CFB Borden. The 900 MHz profiling clearly shows the development of shallow (i. e., above 10 ns) high reflectivity {{in the vicinity of}} the trench immediately after the release. Additional lateral extension of high reflectivity zone was observed over the following 20 days until the seasonal water table low stand occurred, after which no further lateral movement was observed. Throughout the remainder of the monitoring, the 900 MHz profiling observed a long-term dimming of reflectivity at the periphery of the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> While direct imaging of the shallow <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> by the 450 MHz antennas was significantly obscured by the superposition with the direct air-ground wave arrival; its improved depth of penetration allowed the measurement of a velocity “pull-up” of an underlying stratigraphic interface resulting from the displacement of low velocity water by high velocity gasoline. The maximum pull-up was observed during the water table low stand. The ongoing changes in the pull-up magnitude during the remainder of the observation period suggest the continued redistribution of fluids in the <b>impacted</b> <b>zone.</b> Because of the shallow depth of the gasoline <b>impacted</b> <b>zone,</b> the effects of freezing during the winter period were observed in the GPR imaging. The presence of the gasoline <b>impacted</b> <b>zone</b> appears to have affected the depth of freezing, causing a depression of the frozen soil base. The dimming of the direct air-ground wave complex indicates that the contaminant phase brought to the surface by the water table fluctuations have impacted the nature of the near-surface freezing...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} for {{simulating}} dynamic fracture in impact-loaded solids is presented. This model {{is based upon}} the traditional molecular dynamics procedure, but accounts for the irreversible nature of the fracture process by deleting the attractive part of the particle interaction potential when the bond between two particles is stretched beyond a critical length. This critical length is determined by comparison with Griffith theory. In the present paper, the model is applied to a two-dimensional homogeneous solid in the absence of microstructure (microstructural effects are treated in a subsequent publication). When the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> is much smaller man the size of the sample, or the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> is wide and the impact amplitude is large, the first crack forms a finite distance ahead of the <b>impact</b> <b>zone.</b> Static continuum elasticity theory shows that the position of this first crack occurs at the position of the maximum tensile stress. This crack then propagates back to the edges of the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> and forward into the sample, thereby creating an X-shaped crack pattern. The tips of the X-shaped crack propagate more slowly than the stress wave and hence strong deviations from this pattern are observed when the stress wave passes the crack tips. When the predominantly compressive stress wave reflects off the back free surface, a tensile wave propagates back into the sample creating even more damage. This damage occurs in bands parallel to and set back from the back surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a global model for oxygen steelmaking and its validation against industrial data {{has been reported in}} Part 1 of this paper. Part 2 of this paper explained the model {{development of}} decarburization reaction of emulsified droplets and discussed the effects of bloating behaviour of metal droplets on the overall kinetics of the process. Part 3 of this paper focussed on the development of one sub-model on the decarburization reaction in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> and critically evaluates the important process variables affecting the decarburization kinetics. Decarburization rates in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone</b> were calculated using the semi-empirical relationships developed from experimental results. Based on previous experimental studies, both diffusion through the gas phase and surface control were considered in the rate calculations. The model was validated against experimental data from Belton and Sain, and against plant data from Cicutti et al. The model developed was consistent with the experimental and plant data, and provided a reasonable basis for predicting the decarburization of iron in the impact region of oxygen steelmaking. The model predicted that the decarburization rate is sensitive to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the <b>impact</b> <b>zone.</b> As the partial pressure of oxygen decreased from 26. 4 to 16. 2 kPa, the model predicted that that the reaction rate of decarburization via oxygen decreased from 202 to 134 kg/min.
