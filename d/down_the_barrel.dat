25|$|Browning's basic M1911 {{design has}} seen very little change {{throughout}} its production life. The basic {{principle of the}} pistol is recoil operation. As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during {{this portion of the}} firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.|$|E
25|$|The next Test was at {{his home}} ground, Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad. In good batting {{conditions}} the Australians had put on 576 runs in their first innings and the West Indies, having lost opener Devon Smith for a duck were staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> when Ganga came to the crease. In an innings which took 326 minutes, Ganga scored 117 and completed his second Test century in two innings against the Australians.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turned}} out, it was. Brett Lee, opening the bowling for Australia, {{started off with}} a maiden over to Trescothick, and England {{struggled}} {{to get off the}} mark, being four for no wicket after three overs. Another maiden from Glenn McGrath followed, and then Andrew Strauss departed with an inside edge off Lee. In the next over, Trescothick was gone for a 15-ball duck, to an away-swinger from McGrath, and two balls later Paul Collingwood gave a massive inside-edge onto his stumps – England were six for three, and staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
60|$|But that {{official}} {{was nowhere to}} be found. He had slipped away, as soon as the men began to take <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> Some soldiers were at once sent off in search of him.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no single}} {{manufacturer}} {{for the traditional}} messenger's gun, {{as it was a}} generic term describing a class of shotguns offered in a variety of barrel lengths from 18 to 24 in, either by the factory or from owners and gunsmiths cutting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R

25|$|Spring-loaded flex hinge temples: These flex hinges are {{equipped}} with a small spring that affords the arms a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90 degree angle. Repairs {{can be made by}} using Self Aligning Spring Hinge Screws. Use screw insertion pliers to push the tip beyond the first barrel of a spring hinge at a 45 degree angle and use a standard screwdriver to tighten. As the screw moves <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> it will move to a 90 degree angle. When finished, use a plier to break off the excess.|$|E
25|$|It started {{well for}} Australia, too. Including Michael Kasprowicz in the squad and {{gambling}} on winning the toss and subbing {{one of their}} bowlers off, they won it – and Kasprowicz got immediate reward. After the English openers had survived the opening overs of McGrath and Lee to be 25 for 0 after eight overs, Kasprowicz was brought on, and Strauss chopped an inside edge onto his own stumps. Nine balls and three runs later, captain Michael Vaughan was hit on the pads by an inswinging delivery from Glenn McGrath and was out for 1. Marcus Trescothick and Kevin Pietersen soon followed to the pavilion, and England were – yet again – staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> at 45 for 4.|$|E
25|$|This {{match was}} played {{two days after}} the other five {{placement}} matches. Scotland batted Ireland out of the match, their returning county professionals taking full advantage. Ryan Watson top-scored for the Scots with 94, but Dougie Brown (59 off 44 balls) and Fraser Watts (55) also made big contributions, as the Irish bowling conceded their highest total in this tournament – 324 for 8. Paul Hoffmann ripped out two Irish wickets quickly, but Ed Joyce and wicketkeeper Jeremy Bray rebuilt to 148 for 2. However, a flurry of wickets – Craig Wright taking three for 48 as the most – sent the Irish staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> first at 188 for 6, and then at 222 for 9. Not even 34 not out from the number 11, Gordon Cooke could help Ireland, as they lost by 47 runs.|$|E
6000|$|As the {{discharge}} rang out, {{mingled with the}} roar of the guns, Hector shouted, [...] "Fix bayonets, and charge!" [...] The wooden shafts of the bayonets were thrust <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of <b>the</b> firelocks, and with a cheer the seventy-five men rushed upon the shattered head of the column. The charge was irresistible, and the enemy at once fled at full speed along the rampart or leapt from the wall into the lane below.|$|R
6000|$|Then he took Jacob's gun, {{and blew}} <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of it. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "you are as {{skillful}} a huntsman as you asked to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Codfish {{made one}} {{leap into the}} air and came <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> top successfully. Then he tried a second leap, but, as Randy well knew, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> top was weak, and, with a crash, poor Codfish went <b>down</b> {{straight}} into <b>the</b> big <b>barrel</b> up to his armpits.|$|R
25|$|The {{investigation}} into the illegal agents' payments was concluded in the summer, and the club was handed a ten-point deduction for the 2008–09 season on 3 June 2008, along with a £50,000 fine. The club's recent history of administrations meant that the Football League only offered to return the Football League Share to Luton {{on the condition that}} they play with a further twenty-point deduction. Staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of a gun, Luton were forced to start the season with a 30-point penalty, the biggest points deduction ever handed to a club in the top four tiers of English football. Luton beat Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the Football League Trophy final in front of 40,000 of their own supporters at Wembley Stadium, but lost their League status eight days later. On 13 April 2009, Luton Town were finally relegated from the Football League after a spell of 89 years, as Chesterfield held Luton to a draw. Coupled with a victory for Mike Newell's Grimsby Town, this meant Luton's survival in the league became mathematically impossible to achieve.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December, Parma hosted Lecce in a {{match that}} was set {{to be the last}} before Christmas break, but the re-organised Matchday 1 game was now to be played during the week that followed. Jonathan Biabiany's 18th minute run into the box was halted unfairly by the Lecce defence, leading to a chance from the spot for Sergio Floccari who duly {{converted}} to bag his first goal for the club. Just before the hour mark, David Di Michele scored from short range to level the scores, before scoring a magnificent second with a spectacular bicycle kick {{from the edge of the}} penalty area three minutes later. Juan Cuadrado then scored Lecce's third with 13 minutes left in the game with a fine left-footed effort blasted past Antonio Mirante, who was making his 200th professional appearance, as Parma looked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> at another game without a win. A goalkeeping error three minutes from full-time allowed Graziano Pellè to reduce the deficit, his first goal for the club. Deep into injury time, the ball fell to Daniele Galloppa following a poorly cleared corner and he rifled it him to salvage a third consecutive draw for the Ducali.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E
5000|$|Control: Focuses on {{hitting a}} {{specific}} target. They {{need to have}} a bit more power than other types to travel <b>down</b> <b>the</b> directed <b>barrel,</b> since normally <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is longer than most.

6000|$|... 'They aim like yokels at a Wappenschaw,' said Saxon, seating {{himself on}} the side of the waggon. 'Like all young {{soldiers}} they fire too high. When I was an adjutant it was my custom to press <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of <b>the</b> muskets until my eye told me that they were level. These rogues think that they have done their part if they do but let the gun off, though they are as like to hit the plovers above us as ourselves.' ...|$|R
25|$|Both Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa {{were thus}} hemmed in and looking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> of <b>the</b> British guns when Bam Shah’s letter arrived, announcing {{the fall of}} Almora. Although the old {{commander}} was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West were {{turned over to the}} British on 15 May 1815.|$|R
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
500|$|Once on site, {{they would}} be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some {{protection}} to the artillery crew. Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation. The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although {{there was still no}} effort to standardise calibres. The usual loading equipment consisted of a copper loading scoop, a ramrod, and a felt brush or [...] "sponge". A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon. Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> while acids could also be added to the water to clean out the inside of the barrel. Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going.|$|E
500|$|The {{ability to}} compare {{ammunition}} {{is a direct}} result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century. [...] By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of the weapon the bullet's accuracy greatly increases. [...] At the same time, the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel. [...] Prior to mass production of firearms, each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique. [...] The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect's home confirming that he made the bullet. [...] Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted. [...] As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools, the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company. [...] However, experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process. These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear, each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company. [...] Also, each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks, allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet.|$|E

5000|$|Round shot has the {{disadvantage}} of not being tightly fitted into the bore (to do so would cause jamming). This causes the shot to [...] "rattle" [...] <b>down</b> <b>the</b> gun <b>barrel</b> and leave <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> at an angle unless wadding or a discarding sabot is used. This is known as 'windage.' ...|$|R

500|$|At 02.30 on 26 March, the {{regiment}} {{set out in}} thick fog for {{the assault on the}} town of Gaza. By 08:00 they had crossed the Wadi Ghuzze and reached Sheikh Abbas, confronted only by enemy aircraft and some Turkish camel patrols. Two hours later they were about [...] to the east of Gaza, providing a guard force against any reinforcements that might approach from Hareira. The British assault did not go according to plan, and at 14:00 the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to attack the town from the north. The regiment galloped forward together {{with the rest of the}} New Zealand brigade, and occupied Meshahera Ridge north-east of Gaza at 16:00. Dismounting, {{the regiment}} moved into Gaza, with the 6th Squadron leading, followed by the 2nd Squadron, and the 9th Squadron bringing up the rear. At 16:25 they captured a Turkish field ambulance; four officers, 125 other ranks and twenty vehicles. Continuing the assault through artillery and small arms fire, the 2nd and 9th Squadrons reached a cactus hedge. Cutting through it with their bayonets, they engaged the Turkish defenders behind it in hand-to-hand fighting. Two troops then charged across a lagoon, about [...] deep, to capture a Turkish trench. To their right they sighted a Turkish artillery emplacement, and Meldrum ordered the position taken without delay. Two troops from the 2nd and one from the 9th Squadron carried out a bayonet charge and captured the guns intact. Back in the regiment's centre they were held up by a strong Turkish defensive position at a cemetery. Instead of trying to attack the position, they held their line while the captured guns were recovered. The regiment was now some distance in front of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left, and in danger of a flanking counter-attack. To assist the defence of their position, they turned one of the captured guns onto the Turkish strong points, the inexperienced gun crew sighting by peering <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> until they could see their target.|$|E
2500|$|British {{military}} drills of {{the time}} required soldiers to bite open the cartridge, pour the gunpowder contained within <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> ram the cartridge (which included the bullet) <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> remove the ram-rod, bring the rifle to the ready, set the sights, add a percussion cap, present the rifle, and fire. The musketry books also recommended that, [...] "Whenever the grease around the bullet appears to be melted away, or otherwise removed from the cartridge, {{the sides of the}} bullet should be made wet in the mouth before putting it into the barrel; the saliva will serve the purpose of grease for the time being".|$|E
2500|$|Son of Sam {{has been}} popularly (and mistakenly) {{associated}} with the contemporaneous song [...] "Psycho Killer" [...] (1977) by Talking Heads; compositions more directly inspired by the events include [...] "Son of Sam" [...] (1978) by The Dead Boys, and [...] "Looking <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Barrel</b> of a Gun" [...] (1989) by the Beastie Boys. Guitarist Scott Putesky used the stage name [...] "Daisy Berkowitz" [...] while playing with Marilyn Manson in the 1990s. The 1981 Theatre of Hate song 'My Own Invention' explicitly refers to Son of Sam in the lyric 'Son of Sam, the American lamb, Upon whose alter, you'll slaughter'. Additionally, Manson's song [...] "Sam, son of man" [...] quite conspicuously describes Berkowitz; several other rock musicians established a full ensemble named Son of Sam during 2000.|$|E
50|$|A later {{addition}} to the gun was <b>the</b> rifled <b>barrel.</b> This made <b>the</b> gun much more accurate at longer distances but did have drawbacks, the main one being that it took much longer to reload because the bullet had to be pounded <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
60|$|Another {{four days}} passed and--as the ex-officer of Engineers could suggest no certain plan, for the {{destruction}} of the tunnel, which could be carried out in the time which a surprise of the sentries at its mouth would give them--Major Tempe resolved upon delaying no longer; but on sending four men into the tunnel, under Lieutenant Ribouville, with instructions to go as far as they could in a quarter of an hour, to set <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> against <b>the</b> rock, to light a fuse cut to burn a quarter of an hour, and then to return at full speed to the mouth of the tunnel.|$|R

2500|$|The hosts Sri Lanka were {{yet again}} {{stunned by the}} West Indies' {{accurate}} and fierce pace bowling, as they chose to bowl first at Kandy. In the third over, they got immediate reward, having Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind off Daren Powell for 2 – however, TV replays indicated that the decision was unjustified. To the West Indians, that mattered little, as it gave them a much needed confidence boost. Ten overs later, Tino Best and Powell had dug out a further three wickets, and Sri Lanka were staring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> at 42 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan paired up for 56 for the fifth wicket before Best ran out Dilshan, but {{this time there was}} little wagging from the tail, only Muttiah Muralitharan making an unbeaten 18, as Powell took the last three wickets – both Rangana Herath and Lasith Malinga ending up caught behind – and Sri Lanka subsided for 150.|$|E
2500|$|Because the dry {{powdered}} ingredients must {{be mixed}} and bonded together for extrusion and cutting into grains {{to maintain the}} blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. After 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp mill-cake was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming press-cake. The pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity. [...] The hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. Inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> due to the high initial spike in pressure. Mammoth powder with large grains, made for Rodman's 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.|$|E
2500|$|Type-72Z - At the International Arms Exhibition, {{which took}} place in Baghdad between 28 April - 2 May 1989, a T-55 {{equipped}} with the 2A46 125mm gun with fume extractor one third of the way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> from the T-72 tank was displayed. This modernized vehicle was designated as T-72Z, which at first mislead foreign experts since it was believed that the project was based on the T-72 tank. In fact, the number [...] "72" [...] originated from the year of modernization - 1372 according to the Muslim calendar. The loading mechanism of this vehicle was also taken from T-72. The fitting of the loading mechanism required increasing the aft section of the turret. A stub case ejection port on rear of turret. The tank's armour protection was also reinforced through the use of add-on armour on the tank's front glacis. The vehicle also mounted the EFCS-3 fire control system developed by the Slovenian firm 'Fotona' and a new transmission. A set of explosive reactive armour is an optional extra. It is believed that around 200 T-54/T-55 tanks and 150 Chinese Type-59 tanks were brought up to the T-72Z standard.|$|E
50|$|It was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} light anti-aircraft gun {{during the war in}} the Pacific. It is essentially a smaller, lighter version of the 7.7x58mm Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun. It employs the same principles of operation, simply with scaled <b>down</b> components. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> is designed to be rapidly changed in the field, as a result <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> cooling rings have been reduced in size. It was fed from 30-round brass feed strips.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to fire a wad slug through rifled slug barrels, and, unlike with the Foster slug where lead fouling is often a problem, a wad slug typically causes no significant leading, being nested inside a traditional shotshell wad functioning as a sabot as it travels <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shotgun <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
