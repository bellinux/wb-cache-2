25|$|<b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> plays a {{large part}} in several of Oxenham’s books {{published}} between 1917 and 1940. Oxenham was a <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> Guardian when she lived in Ealing, but the attempt to form a group in Sussex failed. The <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> ideals of Work, Health and Love–'Wohelo'–and the training for young girls in household tasks and cookery it provided, were integral to Oxenham's own philosophy, and underlie the plots of several books. From the <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> {{as an integral part}} of a school in A School <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> (1917) and The Crisis in Camp Keema (1928) to the lone <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> Girl, Barbara Holt, in The Junior Captain (1923) and Maidlin becoming a Torchbearer in Maidlin Bears the Torch (1937), <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire</b> is always shown as a way of developing character. As Oxenham became less involved with the organisation, and came more into contact with the Girl Guides, the contrast between the two organisations and their aims are shown, and eventually the reality of the changed situation in England at the time meant that Guides were more often mentioned in her books than <b>Camp</b> <b>Fire.</b>|$|R
