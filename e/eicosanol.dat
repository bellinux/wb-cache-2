40|$|To be {{suitable}} for reducing water evaporation, monolayers need {{to be easy to}} apply and also spread quickly across the surface of water. However, the choice of monolayer often involves a compromise between spreading rate and evaporation resistance. Because emulsions of the monolayer material have been suggested as a way to improve spreading, emulsions were made with the long-chain alcohols hexadecanol, octadecanol and <b>eicosanol</b> using the non-ionic surfactants Brij 78 and Tween 60 as emulsifying agents. The emulsions of octadecanol and <b>eicosanol</b> spread faster than the corresponding powder. However there was no improvement in the spreading of hexadecanol emulsion due to a significant amount of the material dispersing into the bulk water instead of spreading at the interface. The choice of emulsifier to stabilise the emulsions is critical for effective evaporation resistance. Whereas the octadecanol emulsion made with Brij 78 showed improved evaporation resistance, the emulsion with Tween 60 had an appreciably lower evaporation resistance than powdered octadecanol. One limitation of the emulsion application method is the poor spreading on surfaces with an already high surface pressure...|$|E
40|$|The hydrophobation of rosmarinic acid with {{saturated}} aliphatic primary alcohols {{of various}} chain lengths (methanol to <b>eicosanol)</b> was achieved via an acidcatalyzed esterification {{in the presence}} of a highly acidic sulfonic resin. The resulting alkyl rosmarinates were isolated, characterized and their global free radical scavenging activity was determined by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl method in the stationary state. Only the dodecyl ester showed a stronger activity than rosmarinic acid. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The skin glands {{are widely}} used in {{pheromone}} production throughout the vertebrate worlds. Growing evidences show that birds also have chemical communication, but the uropygial (also called preen or oil) glands, serving as only specialized skin glands of birds, have no sex pheromones characterized. Here, by combining GC-MS analysis and bioassay, we show with the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, that birds can used the preen gland-secreted volatiles (a blend of octadecanol, nonadecanol and <b>eicosanol</b> for male budgerigars) spread over body plumage when preening to convey sex information. Here, we first report the avian pheromones derived from the uropyginal gland and suggests that the gland has broader implications than previously known (e. g. plumage waterproofing and reflectance in sexual behaviour of birds...|$|E
40|$|The lipophilization of polar {{antioxidants}} such as phenolics is {{an efficient}} way to enhance their solubility in apolar media. Thus, in emulsified systems, lipophilized antioxidants are supposed to locate at the lipid/aqueous phase interface and to lead to a better protection of unsaturated lipids. Herein, the antiradical activity of chlorogenic acid (5 -CQA) and its corresponding esters with seven fatty alcohols (from methanol to <b>eicosanol)</b> have been achieved using the well-known 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. Hydrophobation was shown to significantly improve the antiradical activity of 5 -CQA esters which reached a maximum for butyl- and octyl-chlorogenate. In addition, for both 5 -CQA and its esters, it was demonstrated that the global mechanism of DPPH* stabilization proceeded likely by electron transfer (ET), while it appeared that the pathways of DPPH* stabilization were different between 5 -CQA and its esters, as confirmed by the LC-MS characterization of reaction products. Finally, strong {{differences were found between the}} tested molecules allowing the proposal of different DPPH* stabilization pathways by electron transfer for 5 -CQA and its esters...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the inaugural intercalation {{study of a}} layered metal sulfonate network. Silver triflate forms intercalation complexes with straight chain primary alcohols from ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) to <b>eicosanol</b> (C 20 H 41 OH). Single-crystal data for the EtOH adduct, 1, are presented which show that the intercalation is coordinative to Ag. In contrast to many other layered hosts, no preheating of Ag triflate is required to liberate a coordination site for intercalation to take place, owing {{to the ability of}} the triflate ion to reorient. Crystal structure parameters for 1 : C 4 H 6 F 6 S 2 O 7 Ag 2, a = 5. 345 (7) ?, b = 11. 310 (2) ?, c = 12. 004 (2) ?, = 116. 87 (1), = 90. 46 (1), = 99. 59 (1), triclinic, space group P, Z = 2. Intercalate 1 presents the triflate ion in an unprecedented 5 -coordination mode. PXRD data on the family of complexes show that the intercalation is topotactic, as verified by the linear increase in d-spacing and calculated c-axis lengths for the intercalates, with increasing chain length. The data also show that the alcohol intercalates adopt an interdigitated rather than bilayer arrangement. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high-quality products and economically and environmentally friendly technologies, {{as well as}} restrictive legislative actions, has stimulated scientific research on the extraction, purification and identification of bioactive compounds from natural sources. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is commonly used in traditional medicine due to its pharmacological properties, such as its anti-inflammatory, antihepatotoxicity, anti-lipoperoxidation, antidiabetic, anti-cancer and antimicrobial activities. The use of industrial residues as sources of bioactive compounds has emerged as an economically viable {{solution to the problem}} of solid waste treatment. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate the SC-CO 2 extraction of polyphenols from pomegranate leaves, evaluating the influence of temperature (40 and 50 °C) and pressure (10 - 30 MPa) on extraction yield (EY), total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity (AA) and the cost of manufacturing (COM) of the extracts. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data, making the visualization more straightforward and manageable. A high EY and TPC and low COM were obtained at the most effective operational conditions of 50 °C and 30 MPa. The lack of correlation between EY-AA and TPC-AA indicated the coextraction of non-phenolic compounds. This assumption was corroborated by GC-MS analysis, which showed high levels of <b>eicosanol,</b> squalene, linoleic acid and tocols. Even though SC-CO 2 extraction resulted in a high TPC (257 - 389 mg. g - 1) compared to the literature data, the low EY (0. 21 - 0. 67 %) and non-phenolic presence suggest that SC-CO 2 extraction may be a good purification pretreatment for the removal of non-polyphenolic compounds prior to further polyphenol extraction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} drivers of soil organic matter (SOM) sequestration. In fact, accurate knowledge of wildfires’ effects on the SOM may provide information on its resilience and physico-chemical properties, as well as on the subsequent soil recovery without human intervention. While the quantitative assessment of fire damage levels on SOM is an issue of great interest to researchers, there is not general consensus on the reliability of the physical and chemical methods frequently used to provide surrogates on the real impact of the passage of fire on the soil. In fact, fire effect on soils depends on a complex interaction of factors (temperature, time, moisture, soil depth…) and in general, characterization of SOM samples from fire-affected ecosystems implies the use of several instrumental techniques. This work aims to provide reliable quantitative proxies for pyrogenic SOM in whole environmental samples, taking advantage from changes in hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) of specific compounds released by analytical pyrolysis (Py-CSIA). With this aim in mind, we carried out a series of controlled burnings of progressive intensity, under laboratory conditions, applied to dry samples of foliar biomass from a typical Mediterranean forest species (Juniperus thurifera) heated at 367 °C for different time periods (5 ', 5 ' 30 >, 6 ' and 7 '). The results showed that isotopic analysis of up to 9 compounds (<b>eicosanol,</b> eugenol, stigmastan- 3, 5 -diene, phenol, phenol, 2 -methoxy- 4 -methyl, pimaric acid, limonene, hexadecenoic acid and methylabietate), common in all samples, allowed a valid assessment of the changes in the δD with the different times of burning. Pimaric acid was the only major compound that had a linear correlation y = 3. 7 x + 153. 6 with a R 2 = 0. 9209, where y corresponds to δD and x is the burning time. The rest of compounds showed different behaviour with the progressive heating, with no defined trends: after the first heating stage, some compounds suffered depletion of the heavy isotope, others were not isotopically altered and others had slight deuterium enrichment (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, all compounds detected in samples subjected to the most intense heating suffered conspicuous deuterium enrichment. The change of isotope signature between control and sample that was burned for 5 min was high in several pyrolysis compounds; therefore, we need to continue the experiment within a broader range of burning times. Our results illustrate that the combination of analytical pyrolysis and isotopic analysis of specific compounds (PyCSIA) opens a new application for the quantification of fire damage levels, and also in the understanding of fire-induced structural changes in SOM, avoiding sample fractionation or wet chemical extractions.
