2500|$|This {{allegation}} surfaced after Stone {{announced he}} would no longer direct the Weinstein Company's Guantanamo TV series following the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations. Stone also drew criticism for defending Weinstein the day before he announced his departure from Guantanamo at the Busan International Film Festival as well, claiming [...] "I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. I believe a man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either. During that period he was a rival.

Katon Dawson, South Carolina's Republican party chairman believed Colbert would be better off using the $35,000 entrance fee to [...] "buy a sports car and get a girlfriend".

[...] Republican candidate John McCain gave a more positive view, stating that he hoped Colbert would join the Republican party's debates. [...] "He can make them livelier and he can reach a wider audience than that narrow little sliver that watches his show." [...] In conversation with ABC News, Fox News commentator and template for Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report persona Bill O'Reilly dismissed Colbert's run as a publicity stunt for his book, I Am America. O'Reilly also called Colbert out for not going on the O'Reilly Factor to discuss the book: [...] "He knows the book is dumb, so he's not going to come in. Instead, he runs for president."

There is a Judge Mayo in that county, who is a candidate for the Legislature, for the purpose, if he secures his election, of helping to re-elect Judge Douglas. He is the editor of a newspaper [De Kalb County Sentinel], and in that paper I find the extract I am going to read.

Suggett denied he had smeared Radice and invited the press to review his election literature and campaign speeches for any evidence of misconduct. He said the real reason was so angry was that the Liberals had “broken the weighbridge on which the Labour majority in Chester-le-Street used to be weighed.” [...] Cyril Smith, who had campaigned for Suggett in the by-election, recalled later that he deliberately, if obliquely, had {{raised the issue of}} political corruption by mentioning in a speech {{at the opening of the}} campaign the T.
