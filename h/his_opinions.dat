5|$|Hogg {{continued}} studying Greek {{literature and}} was able to publish some of <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> about the Greeks in the radical Westminster Review. He used the opportunity to criticise the treatment of the Greeks in the Tory publication Quarterly Review. This article caused some controversy among Hogg's conservative legal colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{lived in}} Indiana from 1816 until 1830, age 7 to 21. It was {{during these years}} that Lincoln first {{encountered}} slavery and began to form <b>his</b> <b>opinions.</b> Growing up in a climate where the state politics were run by men like Jennings and Pennington would have much influence {{on the development of}} Lincoln's views.|$|E
50|$|Justice Fortas, {{writing for}} the dissent, argued that chronic {{alcoholism}} was a disease, and in <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> was no different than the case in Robinson which involved narcotic addiction. Therefore, regardless of where the intoxication took place, in <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> Powell {{should not have been}} convicted.|$|R
5000|$|Shakhmatov {{initially}} dated it by 1448 (hence it {{also used}} to be called 1448 compilation; [...] "свод 1448 г."), but later revised <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> to 1430s. Some Russian philologists shared <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> while others attribute the common source to the 1418 compilation of Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow.|$|R
60|$|For what, then, {{would he}} have the Constitution amended? With him it is a {{proposition}} to remove one impediment merely to be met by others which, in <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> cannot be removed, to enable Congress to do what, in <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> they ought not to do if they could.|$|R
5|$|Boortz's {{first foray}} into authorship was in 1997 with The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear, in which he {{delivers}} <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> on various topics {{in the form of}} a commencement speech he would give to new college graduates, if ever invited to do so. His second book, entitled The Terrible Truth About Liberals, was published in 1998, and contains reprinted material from his first book, along with a significant amount of new material.|$|E
5|$|During 2008 and 2009, {{as part of}} {{programming}} specially commissioned for the 200th anniversary {{of the birth of}} Abraham Lincoln, C-SPAN produced a series titled Lincoln 200 Years, which featured episodes on a variety of topics relating to the life of Lincoln including his career, his homes and <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> of slavery.|$|E
5|$|His accomplishments {{were not}} {{confined}} to the track. He was deeply resentful toward the treatment given toward amateur athletes. He had frequently butted heads with the Amateur Athletic Union, calling the AAU a corrupt organization. <b>His</b> <b>opinions</b> {{played a major role in}} the passing of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, legislation providing legal protection to amateur athletes.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, he {{published}} his treatise on violin playing, Szigeti on the Violin. In it Szigeti presents <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> about the then-current state of violin playing {{and the various}} challenges and issues facing musicians in the modern world, {{as well as a}} detailed examination of violin technique as he understood it.|$|E
5|$|In Moscow, Kennan again {{felt that}} <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> were being ignored by Harry S. Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried {{repeatedly}} to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for {{cooperation with the}} Soviet government {{in favor of a}} sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets' power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not enjoy}} the limited {{influence}} of his judicial role in the later years of his term, when he was more frequently in the minority in voting on cases. After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with little support for many of <b>his</b> <b>opinions,</b> which led him to begin considering retirement.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Boycott {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} commentating career, and <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> are sought across a number of cricketing media. As well as newspaper columns, Boycott contributes to several online blogs, podcasts and question and answer sessions, notably on the BBC News website and CricInfo. He is also popular among cricket pundits and biographers, being the subject of three significant biographies from 1982 to 2000, while his comments are reproduced across a number of published cricketing quotes collections.|$|E
5|$|When his {{teammate}} Dust dies from a hidden medical condition {{brought on by}} her fight with Magma, Anole once again voices <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> about leaving the team as they are constantly put in danger with mortal consequences. Dust is revived by teammate Ink and she convinces the team not to disband.|$|E
5|$|In {{every other}} {{transaction}} of life no man's wits {{could be more}} regular than those of Smart, for this prevalence of one idea pertinaciously keeping the first place in his head had in no sense, except in what immediately related to itself, perverted his judgement at all; <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> were unchanged as before, nor did he seem more likely to fall {{into a state of}} distraction than any other man; less so, perhaps, as he calmed every violent start of passion by prayer.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Eiland-Hall, a 34-year-old {{computer}} science student in Panama City, Florida, saw the discussion on Fark using the Gottfried joke on Beck {{and created a}} website, GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com, intending it as a parody of Beck's style of political commentary. He chose not {{to identify with the}} WHOIS service and decided to remain anonymous. Eiland-Hall used the domain name registrar Namecheap for his site. It was launched on September 1, 2009, and received over 120,000 page views during its first 24 hours. The website asserted that it did not believe the charges were true. Eiland-Hall wrote on the site that those furthering the meme were asserting Beck used a similar strategy to promote <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> and increase his viewership.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{resigned}} {{after the}} Confederate government had fled from Richmond {{at the end}} of the war, and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason. After more than a year in prison, the public mood had softened, and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Florida, where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law. Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole, he continued to make <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> known by writing letters to newspapers. His health began to deteriorate, although he was not incapacitated until the very end. He died on November 9, 1873.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Flick {{sat with}} his mouth open as he heard this,--beating his breast almost with despair. <b>His</b> <b>opinion</b> tallied exactly with Sir William's. Indeed, it was by <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> hardly expressed, but {{perfectly}} understood, that Sir William had been led. But he had not thought that Sir William would be so bold and candid.|$|R

5|$|The {{judicial}} establishment, in {{the broadest}} sense, is composed of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis {{and other members of}} the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) is composed of about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according to critics) for a country of over 23 million.|$|E
5|$|While Arbour {{was pleased}} with her profile, MacKenzie was not. Reviewers noted Off's {{critical}} portrayal of MacKenzie as being excessive and MacKenzie considered suing Off for libel. Instead MacKenzie wrote a response in The Globe and Mail presenting {{his point of view}} concerning the mission and events. In 2008 he wrote an autobiography with a chapter dedicated to addressing the criticism he received as a result of Off's book. While Off condemns MacKenzie for not learning the conflict's history and telling American audiences that both sides were to blame for the conflict, MacKenzie defends himself by stating it was international decision-making, not <b>his</b> <b>opinions,</b> that led the UN to not intervene.|$|E
5|$|Above all, {{he possessed}} a {{resolute}} decision of character, which, however unfortunately {{it may have}} operated under different conditions, appeared to extraordinary advantage at the crisis of continental thrones. Bewildered by the revolutionary din, and oscillating ignominiously between fear and rage, resistance and concession, the clique of crowned heads suffered greatly by contrast with a Sovereign who at least knew his own mind, and was prepared to abide by <b>his</b> <b>opinions.</b> In the European convulsions, therefore, King Ernest maintained the stability of his throne and the tranquillity of his people without damage from revolution or reaction. As Kings, indeed, are computed on the continent, he was an able and even a popular Monarch, and his memory may find, perhaps, in his ancestral dominions a sympathy which it would be vain to bespeak {{for it in the}} scenes of his manhood or the land of his birth.|$|E
