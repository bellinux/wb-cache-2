Here, we describe this new field, show how it relates to modern ecological study, and highlight opportunities that stem from taking a macrosystems perspective. We present a hierarchical framework for investigating macrosystems at any level of ecological organization and in relation to broader and finer scales. Building on well-established theory and concepts from other subdisciplines of ecology, we identify <b>feedbacks,</b> <b>linkages</b> among distant regions, and interactions that cross scales of space and time as the most likely sources of unexpected and novel behaviors in macrosystems.

Currently, some researchers are focusing on effective 2 ̆ 7 end to end 2 ̆ 7 management of key logistical process linkages within the supply chain, as a means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to emulate. The emphasis presented is on improved delivery performance and customer service. This involves defining optimized balances between supply chain parameters, the achievement of which should result in reduced cost, improved use of working capital, better asset utilization and optimized intra-supply-chain usage. This paper discusses the development of a model and illustrates an application in a major multinational steel producer. Progress has been made in understanding the logistical processes that are used to manage supply chain linkages and, importantly, in understanding the feed-forward and <b>feedback</b> <b>linkages</b> that are necessary to enable supply chain management to be more effective.

40|$|Abstract: Sedimentological {{studies of}} {{coarse-grained}} alluvial rivers reveal patterns of bed material sorting {{at a variety}} of spatial scales ranging from downstream fining over the length of the long profile to the vertical segregation of a coarse surface layer at the scale of individual particles. This article reviews the mechanisms that sort bed material by size during sediment entrainment, transport and deposition and discusses some of the inter-relationships that exist between patterns and processes of sediment sorting at different spatial and temporal scales. At initiation of motion, sorting can arise from the preferential entrainment of the finer fractions from the heterogeneous bed sediments. Bedload grain-size distributions are modified during transport as different size fractions are routed along different transport pathways under the influence of nonuniform bed topography and associated flow patterns, and during deposition as the variable pocket geometry of the rough bed surface and turbulence intensity of the flow control the size of the particles that deposit. The review highlights the poor understanding of the many <b>feedback</b> <b>linkages</b> that exist between patterns and processes of sediment sorting at different scales and the need for a greater awareness of the spatial and temporal bounds of these linkages.

He promoted regional networks across the Mediterranean, linking science and policy at national and international levels, focusing on the conservation and sustainable use of genetic diversity. In addition, he worked intensely on improvement of knowledge bases, raising awareness on how research could inform international agreements, and thus lead to evidence-based policies.

His work emphasized the importance of access to diverse plant genetic resources by researchers and farmers, and promoted equitable access to genetic resources through international frameworks. Farmers’ rights, especially those in centres of origin and diversity of cultivated plants, were a key concern for Professor Scarascia Mugnozza, as their access to germplasm needed to be secured as custodians of diversity and the knowledge of how to use these vital resources.

40|$|Successful {{cooperation}} between development researchers and development {{policy makers and}} practitioners translates into better development policies, projects and programmes. Research is relevant if it can provide meaningful input for the practitioners. At the same time, practitioners {{have to be willing}} and able to use these findings to improve their work. Through continuous communication, evaluation and feedback cycles both parties should be able to gain additional insights and improve future outcomes. But how close is reality to this ideal state of collaboration between theory and practice? Development researchers are often said to be working in ivory towers - doing research for the sake of publications with results that are hardly relevant or applicable in practice. But is this necessarily so and is it the only reason for the lack of {{cooperation between}} research and practice? What role do personal communication, time horizons and the researchers' fear of losing their academic reputation play? To answer this question, we developed two surveys, one among development researchers and one among development practitioners in Germany, asking them about the intensity and quality of cooperation and <b>feedback</b> <b>linkages</b> between research and practice. We also asked about the main obstacles and the expectations about the future of cooperation between the two groups. The questionnaires were published on the PEGNet website and contained 27 questions. The researcher questionnaire was sent to about 2000 development researchers in Germany and abroad in early 2014. Within three weeks 145 researchers answered the questionnaire. The practitioner questionnaire was distributed in 2013 (Kleemann and B 6 hme 2013). Although the results are not representative for the development research sector as a whole they provide some interesting insights into existing problems {{and what can be done}} about them. The results show that both researchers and practitioners are interested in cooperating more. Researchers in particular believe that better collaboration would be mutually beneficial, resulting in additional insights for their research and better development outcomes. From their point of view the current state of cooperation is unsatisfactory because of four main reasons: different interests, different time frames, poor communication and mistrust. The practitioners' and researchers' opinion on the main obstacles for cooperation coincide to a large extent, and in particular on the question of timing. Practitioners complain about the slowness of research wherefore they have to make decisions before the researchers can provide them with their findings (Bell and Squire 2014). Moreover, practitioners claim that researchers are mainly aiming at publishing their results and are therefore neglecting the applicability of their research. Hence, in order to improve the cooperation environment researchers and practitioners have to learn how to trust and respect each other, to communicate better and to find ways to handle differences in timing...|$|R

This review addresses {{the urgent need}} to quantitatively define proglacial systems {{not only in terms}} of spatial extent but also in terms of functional processes. It firstly provides a critical appraisal of prevailing conceptual models of proglacial systems, and uses this to justify compiling data on rates of landform change in terms of planform, horizontal motion, elevation changes and sediment budgets. These data permit us to produce novel summary conceptual diagrams that consider proglacial landscape evolution in terms of a balance of longitudinal and lateral water and sediment fluxes. Throughout, we give examples of newly emerging datasets and data processing methods because these have the potential to assist with the issues of: (i) a lack of knowledge of proglacial systems within high-mountain, arctic and polar regions, (ii) considerable inter- and intra-catchment variability in the geomorphology and functioning of proglacial systems, (iii) problems with the magnitude of short-term geomorphological changes being at the threshold of detection, (iv) separating short-term variability from longer-term trends, and (v) of the representativeness of plot-scale field measurements for regionalisation and for upscaling. We consider that understanding of future climate change effects on proglacial systems requires holistic process-based modelling to explicitly consider <b>feedbacks</b> and <b>linkages,</b> especially between hillslope and valley-floor components. Such modelling must be informed by a new generation of repeated distributed topographic surveys to detect and quantify short-term geomorphological changes...|$|R

METHODS: A random sample of 800 inhabitants of Leidsche Rijn (a newly built residential area {{in the city of}} Utrecht) between 45 and 70 years old was invited by their general practitioner to participate in this study and sent a web-based health risk assessment containing a questionnaire, covering socio-demographic variables, family and personal medical history, lifestyle behaviour and psychological variables. The system generates an individual cardiovascular risk based on prognostic modelling. In the case of increased risk further biometric and laboratory evaluation is advised. All participants received tailored web-based feedback with an electronic referral to available medical, psychological and lifestyle interventions in the neighbourhood, or online interventions, and a follow-up questionnaire after six months. RESULTS: The participation rate was 29 % (230 / 800) of which 39 % (89 / 230) were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and were advised to perform biometric measures, of which 36 % (32 / 89) actually did. Of these respondents 25 % (8 / 32) had increased blood pressure (≥ 140 / 90), 56 % (18 / 32) increased total cholesterol (> 6. 0 [*]mmol/l). One-third of the participants started changing their lifestyle, 20 % indicated planning to do this later; 32 % (41 / 129) increased their physical activity and 28 % (36 / 129) were eating healthier. Seventy-nine per cent of the responders stated their participation was 'meaningful'. CONCLUSIONS: The personalized prevention approach offers a system for integrated risk profiling and individualized health management that was well received in general practice. The client-centred approach, which was embedded in a local community setting, using a web-based health risk assessment with tailored <b>feedback</b> and <b>linkage</b> to regional health management and lifestyle providers proved feasible, and successful.

Yet, little data exist about the sink and source terms of the production and reduc- tion of N 2 O outside the well-known oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). Here we show the pres- ence of functional marker genes for the reduction of N 2 O in the last step of the denitrification process (nitrous oxide reductase genes; nosZ) in oxygenated surface waters (180 – 250 O 2 μmol. kg- 1) in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Overall copy numbers indicated that nosZ genes represented {{a significant proportion of}} the microbial community, which is unexpected in these oxygenated waters. Our data show strong temperature sensitivity for nosZ genes and reaction rates along a vast latitudinal gradient (32 °S- 12 °S). These data suggest a large N 2 O sink in the warmer Tropical waters of the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Clone sequenc- ing from PCR products revealed that most denitrification genes belonged to Rhodobactera- ceae.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{recognition that}} landforms are complex Earth systems with process-response linkages that span temporal scales from seconds to millennia and spatial scales from sand grains to landscapes, research that integrates knowledge across these scales is fairly uncommon. As a result, understanding of geomorphic systems is often scale-constrained {{due to a}} host of methodological, logistical, and theoretical factors that limit the scope of how Earth scientists study landforms and broader landscapes. This paper reviews recent advances in understanding of the geomorphology of beach-dune systems derived from over a decade of collaborative research from Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. A comprehensive summary of key findings is provided from short-term experiments embedded within a decade-long monitoring program and a multi-decadal reconstruction of coastal landscape change. Specific attention is paid to the challenges of scale integration and the contextual limitations research at specific spatial and/or temporal scales imposes. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates across key scales of investigation in geomorphology and is grounded in classic ideas in Earth surface sciences on the effectiveness of formative events at different scales. The paper uses this framework to organize the review of this body of research in a 'scale aware' way and, thereby, identifies many new advances in knowledge on the form and function of subaerial beach-dune systems. Finally, the paper offers a synopsis of how greater understanding of the complexities at different scales can be used to inform the development of predictive models, especially those at a temporal scale of decades to centuries, which are most relevant to coastal management issues. Models at this (landform) scale require an understanding of controls that exist at both ‘landscape’ and ‘plot’ scales. Landscape scale controls such as sea level change, regional climate, and the underlying geologic framework essentially provide bounding conditions for independent variables such as winds, waves, water levels, and littoral sediment supply. Similarly, an holistic understanding of the range of processes, <b>feedbacks,</b> and <b>linkages</b> at the finer plot scale is required to inform and verify the assumptions that underly the physical modelling of beach-dune interaction at the landform scale...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{assessments}} of biomass {{supply and demand}} and their impacts face various types of limitations and uncertainties, {{partly due to the}} type of tools and methods applied (e. g. partial representation of sectors, lack of geographical details, aggregated representation of technologies involved). Improved collaboration between existing modeling approaches may provide new, more comprehensive insights, especially into issues that involve multiple economic sectors, different temporal and spatial scales or various impact categories. Model collaboration consists of aligning and harmonizing input data and scenarios, model comparison and/or model linkage. Improved collaboration between existing modeling approaches can help assess (i) the causes of differences and similarities in model output, which is important for interpreting the results for policy-making, and (ii) the <b>linkages,</b> <b>feedbacks</b> and trade-offs between different systems and impacts (e. g. economic and natural), which is key to a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of biomass supply and demand. But, full consistency or integration in assumptions, structure, solution algorithm, dynamics and feedbacks can be difficult to achieve. And, if it is done, it frequently implies a tradeoff in terms of resolution (spatial, temporal, structural) and/or computation. Three key research areas are selected to illustrate how model collaboration can provide additional ways for tackling some of the shortcomings and uncertainties in the assessment of biomass supply and demand and their impacts. These research areas are livestock production, agricultural residues and greenhouse gas emissions from land use change. Describing how model collaboration might look like in these examples, we show how improved model collaboration can strengthen our ability to project biomass supply, demand and impacts. This in turn can aid in improving the information for policy-makers and in taking better-informed decisions...|$|R

The overarching objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) study the abiotic and biotic configurations of landform units as mosaics within a Mojave Desert chronosequence; and (2) elucidate their potential feedbacks, interactions, and dynamics during landform evolution. Seven landform units distributed over three geomorphic ages were identified, including: young bars and swales; intermediate-aged flattened bars, flattened swales, and bioturbation units; and old desert pavements and shrub zones. These landform units were characterized according to abiotic and biotic land surface properties. Landform units were statistically distinct and predictable based on a specific suite of abiotic and biotic properties. Vascular plant functional group and biological soil crust community diversity varied with geomorphology, with greatest diversity associated with bars and shrub zones and lowest diversity associated with desert pavements. Biological soil crust communities were controlled by geomorphic age, surface rock size, and protruding rocks with young bar units having the highest abundance and diversity. Perennial forbs were observed in old shrub zones with small rocks and few protruding rocks. A high clast density and a finer-sized clast distribution were found particularly in desert pavements and flattened swales, and generally inhibited biological soil crust and plant cover. Evolutionary trajectories for landforms of a lower piedmont landscape can be dominated by either abiotic and biotic landform processes. These two trajectories are distinctly different and are associated with their own unique <b>linkages,</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> and dynamics of abiotic and biotic land surface properties, producing a highly diverse desert landscape. © 2013 Elsevier B.

They are important health care innovations that enable effective treatment using less invasive techniques, and they improve health care delivery and patient outcomes. Devices can also introduce risk of harm to patients. Our objective was to propose a surveillance system framework to improve the safety {{associated with the use}} of medical devices in a hospital. Materials and methods: The proposed medical device surveillance system incorporates multiple components to accurately document and assess the appropriate actions to reduce the risk of incidents, adverse events, and patient harm. The assumptions on which the framework is based are highlighted. The surveillance system was designed from the perspective of a tertiary teaching hospital that includes dedicated hospital staff whose mandate is to provide safe patient care to inpatients and outpatients and biomedical engineering services. Results: The main components of the surveillance system would include an adverse medical device events database, a medical device/equipment library, education and training, and an open communication and <b>feedback</b> strategy. Close <b>linkages</b> among these components and with external medical device/equipment networks to the hospital must be established and maintained. A feedback mechanism on medical device-related incidents, as well as implementation and evaluation strategies for the surveillance system are described to ensure a seamless transition and a high satisfactory level among the hospital staff.

Pregnancy presents a unique opportunity for partners to test for HIV, as many pregnant women will attend antenatal care (ANC). We describe the views of pregnant women and their male partners on HIV self-test kits that are woman-delivered, alone or with an additional intervention. A formative qualitative study to inform {{the design of a}} multi-arm multi-stage cluster-randomized trial, comprised of six focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews, was conducted. ANC attendees were purposively sampled on the day of initial clinic visit, while men were recruited after obtaining their contact information from their female partners. Data were analysed using content analysis, and our interpretation is hypothetical as participants were not offered self-test kits. Providing HIV self-test kits to pregnant women to deliver to their male partners was highly acceptable to both women and men. Men preferred this approach compared with standard facility-based testing, as self-testing fits into their lifestyles which were characterized by extreme day-to-day economic pressures, including the need to raise money for food for their household daily. Men and women emphasized the need for careful communication before and after collection of the self-test kits in order to minimize the potential for intimate partner violence although physical violence was perceived as less likely to occur. Most men stated a preference to first self-test alone, followed by testing as a couple. Regarding interventions for optimizing linkage following self-testing, both men and women felt that a fixed financial incentive of approximately USD$ 2 would increase linkage. However, there were concerns that financial incentives of greater value may lead to multiple pregnancies and lack of child spacing. In this low-income setting, a lottery incentive was considered overly disappointing for those who receive nothing. Phone call reminders were preferred to short messaging service.
