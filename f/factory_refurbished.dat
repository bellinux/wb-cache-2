50|$|After {{returning}} home, Orr {{entered into}} the family business, and became active in Republican politics of Vanderburgh County. Many Evansville factories had been creating war implements, {{and the end of}} the conflict led many of them to close. Orr began purchasing vacated <b>factories,</b> <b>refurbishing</b> them to produce goods, and selling them. Through his activity he became involved in a local economic development committee. His business and holding expanded rapidly and by 1953 he was on the board of twenty local businesses including Erie Investments, Sterling Brewers, and Grand Junction, and was director of twelve other companies.

These areas of study focus on computer effects, animation and design for film, television, games and the Internet. To meet this demand, a former 64000 sq ft carriage <b>factory</b> was <b>refurbished</b> as a high-end, 800-computer animation and effects teaching/production house complete with render farm, green-screen stages and even stop-motion labs. SCAD recently added a program in sound design, offering concentration in post-production for film.|$|R

After being used {{for nearly a century}} as court of justice and <b>factory</b> it was <b>refurbished</b> as {{residence}} for the Stieber family (created Barons of Stieber by Ludwig III of Bavaria in 1917) between 1892 and 1916.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, H. Forman & Son {{learned of}} London’s bid {{to host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics. The company would have to {{relocate}} following a Compulsory Purchase Order. Forman’s newly <b>refurbished</b> <b>factory</b> was located on land that was proposed to become the running track of the Olympic Stadium. This relocation was confirmed in July 2005 when London won the bid to host the 2012 Summer games.|$|R
50|$|Indoor kart tracks can {{be found}} in many large cities in {{different}} parts of the world. These tracks are often located in <b>refurbished</b> <b>factories</b> or warehouses, and are typically shorter than traditional outdoor tracks. Indoor karts are usually powered by a four-stroke gasoline engine producing anywhere from , or sometimes by an electric motor. Many tracks offer competitive races and leagues. At the top level, an Indoor Karting World Championship (IKWC) exists.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{planning}} {{of the expedition}} took place in 2008 and 2009. The HMP Okarian was originally a military ambulance Humvee on loan from AM General to Hollywood where it was featured in many films and TV shows, notably in The Rock (1996). When the Northwest Passage Drive Expedition project was approved, the vehicle was called back to the AM General <b>factory</b> to be <b>refurbished</b> and modified to become the HMP Okarian.|$|R

In North America 136500 sq ft was leased for office space, factory and warehousing, split between two sites in Burbank California.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese government, {{which took}} {{over most of}} the new CRT {{manufacturing}} capacity worldwide in the 1990s, opposed the import of used CRTs. Many of the factory owners, relocated their businesses in 2006 and 2007 to countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Others relocated their used monitor sourcing operations only to Hong Kong and Vietnam, trucking the CRTs overland to Chinese factories. The USA has its own CRT <b>refurbishing</b> <b>factory,</b> Video Display Corp of Tucker, Georgia.|$|R
50|$|Fourth-generation Forman owner Lance Forman {{joined the}} {{business}} in 1994. He oversaw the company doubling in size in 1996, when it expanded into a neighboring property in Queen's Yard.

500|$|In the 1800s, Plymouth {{remained}} a relatively isolated seacoast town whose livelihood depended on fishing and shipping. The town {{eventually became a}} regional center of shipbuilding and fishing. Its principal industry was the Plymouth Cordage Company, founded in 1824, [...] which became the world's largest manufacturer of rope and cordage products. At one point, the longest ropewalk {{in the world was}} found on the Cordage Company's site on the North Plymouth waterfront, a quarter-mile (0.4km) in length. It thrived into the 1960s, but was forced out of business in 1964 due to competition from synthetic-fiber ropes. The <b>refurbished</b> <b>factory</b> is home to numerous offices, restaurants, and stores, known as Cordage Commerce Center.|$|R

50|$|When Colin {{suddenly}} {{returns to}} Weatherfield, Charlotte helps John to tell Colin {{what he has}} been doing in his absence. Charlotte is horrified when Colin suddenly collapses and dies during an argument with her and John. Under pressure from John, she helps him hide Colin's body in the charred remains of the Underworld factory, and when the <b>factory</b> is <b>refurbished</b> the body is buried under concrete. Charlotte also helps John collect Colin's belongings from his boarding house and burn them. In the subsequent days, Charlotte continues hanging around John for support, claiming she is very worried and scared {{of the consequences of}} their actions.

Charlotte tells Fiz that John is still teaching, despite telling her he had handed in his notice, Fiz then temporarily leaves John. When John finds out about this, and after Charlotte makes another pass at him, he tells her he finds her repulsive and has no feelings whatsoever for her.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{involved}} reuse {{organizations are}} [...] "repair and overhaul" [...] industries which take valuable parts, such as engine blocks, office furniture, toner cartridges, single-use cameras, aircraft hulls, and cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and refurbish {{them in a}} factory environment {{in order to meet}} the same/similar specifications as new products. Xerox (copy machines), and Cummins Engine are examples of <b>refurbishing</b> <b>factories</b> in the USA. Rolls Royce has a very large aircraft remanufacturing factory in Singapore; Caterpillar recently announced the opening of a tractor refurbishing plant in China. Some factories operate in competition with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). When the refurbished item is resold under a new label (used monitor CRTs made into TVs, or cameras resold under a new label) this has been found legal by most courts.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1960s, the {{importance}} of vocational and technical education was becoming obvious, and in 1964, Paterson Mayor Frank X. Graves Jr. turned over Paterson Tech to the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders, thereby providing all youngsters in Passaic County access to Passaic County Technical and Vocational High School. With students flooding {{in from all over}} the county, Passaic County Tech, now reaching a student population of 500 young men and one girl, was bursting at the seams. The school's two buildings [...] - [...] one dating from the Civil War located at the corner of Summer and Ellison, the other a <b>refurbished</b> <b>factory</b> on Market Street [...] - [...] could not meet the demands. By 1965 plans were well underway to build a new school that would accommodate students for generations to come.|$|R

5000|$|The IMARA (from Swahili {{word for}} [...] "power") group {{sponsors}} {{a variety of}} outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run {{under the aegis of}} CSAIL and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater Boston, Massachusetts, Kenya, Native American Indian tribal reservations in the American Southwest such as the Navajo Nation, the Middle East, and Fiji Islands. The CommuniTech project strives to empower under-served communities through sustainable technology and education and does this through the MIT Used Computer <b>Factory</b> (UCF), providing <b>refurbished</b> computers to under-served families, and through the Families Accessing Computer Technology (FACT) classes, it trains those families to become familiar and comfortable with computer technology.|$|R
50|$|CIF was {{established}} in 1985 to create a prison in which inmates would work {{in a variety of}} industrial jobs while completing their sentences. The Department of Correction established a plant at CIF to process food grown on state farms at the Pendleton Correctional Facility formerly known as the Indiana Reformatory, and the State Prison in Michigan City, Indiana. The food was originally used only for state institutions, but later included some county jails. At the beginning, the prison had a cattle and pig slaughterhouse, meat processing plant, creamery, bakery, and vegetable processing area. The slaughterhouse was closed in approximately 1998. Only the bakery closed January 1, 2008 and all the equipment was auctioned off. In its place, the former food processing plant buildings were used to rebuild engines and transmissions (and possibly also engines and differentials) for Ready-Built Transmissions.. This was later replaced by a brake <b>refurbishing</b> <b>factory</b> that is run in partnership with Meritor, an industrial company.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the item}} is resold {{under the same}} OEM name, it is informally {{considered}} a [...] "gray market" [...] item - if it is sold as used, it's legal, if it's represented as an OEM product eligible for rebates and warranties, it is considered [...] "counterfeit" [...] or [...] "black market". The automobile parts industry in the USA is governed by laws on the disclosure of [...] "used" [...] parts and, in some states, mattresses which have been used are required to be sanitized or destroyed. Whether these laws are in place to protect consumers from black market items, or to protect manufacturers ("hindsight obsolescence"), is often an area of intense debate. Fuji Photo Film Co. v. Jazz Photo Corp. is a recent example of the war between patent holders and <b>refurbishing</b> <b>factories.</b> To quote the 2003 District Court of New Jersey:"Thus, the key issue in the dispute between Fuji and Jazz is whether the cameras sold by Jazz are [...] "refurbished" [...] {{in such a way}} that they can be considered to have been permissibly [...] "repaired" [...] or impermissibly [...] "reconstructed." ...|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s {{dairying}} in the Gladstone hinterland {{declined in}} favour of beef cattle and tropical fruit, and the PCD, following a national trend, turned to bulk milk rather than butter production, establishing milk pasteurising facilities and a bottling plant at its Gladstone factory in 1955-57. The <b>factory</b> building was <b>refurbished</b> to accommodate milk processing to meet codes of practice and included {{the introduction of a}} lower ceiling in the milk processing room and the re-finishing of the floor. Milk from the dairies was transported to the site by road and by rail. It was received at the northern end of the factory, whereupon the cans were weighed, milk was checked for freshness, sample cups were taken from each supplier and daily cream dockets were issued. The cans were placed upon a conveyor which tipped the milk into troughs and milk was strained into vats. The cans went to the can washer where they were cold rinsed, caustic washed, hot washed and steamed dried before being returned to the supplier for removal. The milk was centrifugally tested and pasteurised in the with the salt hole and pump house on the site providing the water for the vacuum before being bottled and then transported by conveyor to the stores.|$|R
