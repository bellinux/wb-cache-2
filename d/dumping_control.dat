In overburden dumps, the availability of water and oxygen is strongly controlled by the physical structure of the dump, as well as the surface climate and geochemical reaction within the dump. In this study, a series of field investigations, physical and geochemical laboratory characterization were conducted in order to evaluate internal physical structure and geochemical characteristics of coal mine overburden dumps. The study found that a multi bench structure consisting of 10 m height of inter-fingered slope layer is formed as the effect of the end dumping technique. In addition, overburden material was characterized to have high clay content and low durable characteristic when interact with water. These characteristics couple with mining equipment traffic has result in a compacted layer on the surface of each bench lift which then controls the groundwater flow path within the dumps. Moreover, the geochemical characteristics were random, alternating among potentially acid forming and non acid forming materials within the inter-fingered layer. Those alternate geochemical characteristics may control acidification-neutralization reaction of infiltrated water, precipitation of secondary mineral and determines the quality of the overburden dump drainage, subsequently.

The material scheduled divided into overburden, low grade, and ore.

40|$|Artificially-created {{hydrological}} catchments are characterised by sediment structures from technological construction {{processes that}} can potentially {{be important for}} modelling of flow and transport and for understanding initial soil and ecosystem development. The subsurface spatial structures of such catchments {{have not yet been}} sufficiently explored and described. Our objective was to develop a structure generator programme for modelling the 3 -D spatial distribution patterns of dumped sediments depending on the technical earth-moving and deposition processes. We are focussing in a first step on integrating sediment dumping, particle size, and bulk density modification processes on the catchment scale. For the model development, the artificially-constructed hydrological catchment "Chicken Creek" located in Lower Lusatia, Germany, served as an example. The structure generator describes 3 -D technological sediment distributions at two scales: (i) for a 2 -D-vertical cross-section, texture and bulk density distributions are generated within individual spoil cones that result from mass dumping, particle segregation, and compaction and (ii) for the whole catchment, the spoil cones are horizontally arranged along trajectories of mass <b>dumping</b> <b>controlled</b> by the belt stacker-machine relative to the catchment's clay layer topography. The generated 3 -D texture and bulk density distributions are interpolated and visualised as a gridded 3 -D-volume body using 3 -D computer-aided design software. The generated subsurface sediment distribution for the Chicken Creek catchment was found to correspond to observed patterns already without calibration. Spatial aggregation and interpolation in the gridded volume body modified the generated distributions towards more uniform (unimodal) distributions and lower values of the standard deviations. The modelling approach is generally applicable to all situations where large masses of unconsolidated sediment are moved and dumped thereby allowing generation of basic soil structures and patterns of hydrological systems...|$|R

However, this open dump site is still used today, although it remains unstable due to its overload and to the steep slope of its 9.5  m high front.

Foram aplicados questionários às prefeituras e {{realizadas}} visitas nos municípios para mapear tanto lixões ativos e desativados como aterros controlados e sanitários. Os parâmetros utilizados foram: existência de cercas; tipo de cobertura; retirada dos resíduos antes da cobertura; proximidades com águas superficiais; presença de catadores ou animais; monitoramento e coleta de chorume e gás; distância de moradias e existência de coleta seletiva. A partir da pesquisa, foram localizados vinte e sete lixões desativados, sendo que dezoito deles receberam algum tipo de remediação; porém, em nenhum deles ocorreu de forma padrão. Detectou-se precariedade na remediação nos lixões desativados, pois a simples cobertura com terra não é suficiente, já que o material ali depositado continua poluindo através do chorume produzido. Atualmente, todos os municípios depositam os seus resíduos sólidos urbanos em aterros sanitários localizados em Xanxerê e Xaxim.
