He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{got into}} jazz when I got into Woody Herman's band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It {{was the first}} band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [...] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That's the first time I sort of got into jazz. The first time I sort of felt that I was {{anything}} remotely connected with jazz.|$|E
2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe looking for all types of things. And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something like this from him... And the fact that it’s on National Geographic doesn’t mean much. Unfortunately, over the past years they’ve had many questionable programs.".|$|E

Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the nuclear}} {{disaster}} in Japan {{is likely to}} have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Speaking on CNBC in March, Buffet said that the [...] "United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that". [...] "Radiation terrifies people", Buffett told CNBC. [...] "It's unseen, there's no way to quantify sort of the limits of what might happen from it so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be very surprised if there's any nuclear facilities built in the United States for a long time." [...] Moreover, Japan's government and TEPCO response to the Fukushima Daiichi incident has been criticized worldwide, and Gregory B. Jaczko, Chairman [...] of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, broke with ordinary protocols by overruling the Japanese with regard to the public exclusion zone. As a result of the harshly criticized Japanese handling of the crisis, there has been a scramble by the EU to reform nuclear policy. Some commentators expect that US will have greater influence on nuclear policy worldwide.|$|E

60|$|Judge Douglas says if the Constitution carries slavery {{into the}} Territories, beyond {{the power of}} the people of the Territories to control it as other {{property}}; then it follows logically that every one who swears to support the Constitution of the United States must give that support to that property which it needs. And, if the Constitution carries slavery into the Territories, beyond {{the power of the}} people, to control it as other property, then it also carries it into the States, because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Now, gentlemen, if it were not for my excessive modesty, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> told that very thing to Judge Douglas quite a year ago. This argument is here in print, and if it were not for my modesty, as I said, I might call your attention to it. If you read it, you will find that I not only made that argument, but made it better than he has made it since.|$|E
60|$|I {{leave the}} {{impression}} {{noted in the}} foregoing pages to tell its own small story, but have it on my conscience to wonder, in this connection, quite candidly and publicly and by way of due penance, at the scantness of such first-fruits of my sensibility. I was to see Siena repeatedly {{in the years to}} follow, I was to know her better, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was to do her an ampler justice didn't that remark seem to reflect a little on my earlier poor judgment. This judgment strikes me to-day as having fallen short--true as it may be that I find ever a value, or at least an interest, even in the moods and humours and lapses of any brooding, musing or fantasticating observer to whom the finer sense of things is on the whole not closed. If he has on a given occasion nodded or stumbled or strayed, this fact by itself speaks to me of him--speaks to me, that is, of his faculty and his idiosyncrasies, and I care nothing for the application of his faculty unless it be, first of all, in itself interesting. Which may serve as my reply to any objection here breaking out--on the ground that if a spectator's languors are evidence, of a sort, about that personage, they are scarce evident about the case before him, at least if the case be important. I let my perhaps rather weak expression of the sense of Siena stand, at any rate-- for the sake of what I myself read into it; but I should like to amplify it by other memories, and would do so eagerly if I might here enjoy the space. The difficulty for these rectifications is that if the early vision has failed of competence or of full felicity, if initiation has thus been slow, so, with renewals and extensions, so, with the larger experience, one hindrance is exchanged for another. There is quite such a possibility as having lived into a relation too much {{to be able to make}} a statement of it.|$|E

2500|$|President Barack Obama {{called the}} bomb attempt a [...] "sobering {{reminder}} of the times in which we live", and said that Americans [...] "will not cower in fear" [...] {{as a result of}} it. He telephoned Duane Jackson, one of the vendors, to thank him for alerting police. Attorney General Eric Holder called it a [...] "terrorist act". White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, similarly, said [...] "Anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> was intended to terrorize, absolutely.

6000|$|To avoid mistake, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{not only}} commend {{the study of}} this literature, but wish our sources of supply and {{comparison}} vastly enlarged. American students may well derive from all former lands--from forenoon Greece and Rome, down to the perturb'd mediaeval times, the Crusades, and so to Italy, the German intellect--all the older literatures, and all the newer ones--from witty and warlike France, and markedly, and in many ways, and at many different periods, from the enterprise {{and soul of the}} great Spanish race--bearing ourselves always courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the mother-world, to all its nations dead, as all its nations living--the offspring, this America of ours, the daughter, not by any means of the British isles exclusively, but of the continent, and all continents. Indeed, it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we also hold from Italy, France, Spain, especially in the best imaginative productions of those lands, which are, in many ways, loftier and subtler than the English, or British, and indispensable to complete our service, proportions, education, reminiscences, &c.... The British element these States hold, and have always held, enormously beyond its fit proportions. I have already spoken of Shakspere. He seems to me of astral genius, first class, entirely fit for feudalism. His contributions, especially to the literature of the passions, are immense, forever dear to humanity--and his name is always to be reverenced in America. But there is much in him ever offensive to democracy. He is not only the tally of feudalism, but I should say Shakspere is incarnated, uncompromising feudalism, in literature. Then one seems to detect something in him--I hardly know how to describe it--even amid the dazzle of his genius; and, in inferior manifestations, it is found in nearly all leading British authors. (Perhaps we will have to import the words Snob, Snobbish, &c., after all.) While of the great poems of Asian antiquity, the Indian epics, the book of Job, the Ionian Iliad, the unsurpassedly simple, loving, perfect idyls of {{the life and death of}} Christ, in the New Testament, (indeed Homer and the Biblical utterances intertwine familiarly with us, in the main,) and along down, of most of the characteristic, imaginative or romantic relics of the continent, as the Cid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, &c., I should say they substantially adjust themselves to us, and, far off as they are, accord curiously with our bed and board to-day, in New York, ...|$|E
