5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a <b>distress</b> <b>call.</b> It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose {{ownership}} is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} <b>distress</b> <b>call,</b> which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons at any one time and they must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E
40|$|The {{allometric}} {{relationship between}} body size and song frequency {{has been established}} in previous studies of temperate and tropical bird communities. However, the relationship between body size and the frequency of <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> has been examined in only one study of temperate birds. We examined size-frequency relationships in the <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and songs of a Neotropical bird community in northwestern Costa Rica. In 2008 and 2009, we recorded <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and determined the body mass of 54 mist-netted birds representing 38 species, 35 genera, and 14 families. We obtained songs for these same species from sound libraries and commercially available compact discs. For each vocalization, we measured minimum frequency and frequency of maximum amplitude. Larger birds produced lower-frequency <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and songs than smaller birds. Phylogenetically controlled analyses revealed that the frequency of maximum amplitude was negatively correlated with body mass for both <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and songs. Minimum frequency was negatively correlated with mass for <b>distress</b> <b>calls,</b> but not songs. Our analyses suggest that the influence of phylogeny on the relationship between frequency characteristics and body size is modest. Pair-wise comparisons across 37 species revealed that <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and songs had similar minimum frequencies, but songs had significantly lower frequencies of maximum amplitude than <b>distress</b> <b>calls.</b> This difference may arise from differences in signal function. Lower-frequency sounds should transmit farther through forest habitats and songs must often transmit longer distances to reach their intended audience than <b>distress</b> <b>calls.</b> Our results support the general theory that body size is negatively correlated with the frequency of acoustic signals by demonstrating that this pattern holds true for both <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and songs in a Neotropical bird community. © 2011 The Authors.

5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A <b>distress</b> <b>call,</b> emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E

This benefit, however, {{depends on the}} ability to react to the alert message of the call, which may be impaired by natural variation in the <b>calls.</b> The <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> of L. chiliensis show geographic variation, and here we tested the response of two geographically distant populations (> 700 km apart) to local (homotypic) and non-local (heterotypic) distress calls; if populations are finely tuned to their local calls, {{they may not be able}} to respond to heterotypic calls. We found that geographic variation in calls affects the lizards' response, but this effect was population dependent; whereas southern lizards responded to calls of both populations, the northern lizards only reacted to homotypic <b>distress</b> <b>calls.</b> The factors that determine this asymmetric response to heterotypic calls are unclear and we discuss three hypotheses that have a common component in the difference in body size between the tested populations, which seems to play a key role in determining the response to <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> in this species.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the association between}} bird song and parasite load, {{but there is no}} evidence regarding the relationships among pathogens and alarm or <b>distress</b> <b>calls,</b> which are used in antipredator strategies. We analyzed the association between virus infection and the <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> of lesser short-toed lark (Calandrella rufescens), addressing the relationships between call acoustic properties, presence of poxvirus lesions, and other measurements of bird health (body condition, T-cell [...] mediated immune response, heterophils-to-lymphocytes ratio [H/L ratio], and blood parasites). The study was carried out in Fuerteventura (Canary Islands), where 55 % of lesser short-toed larks were infected. Pox infection was associated with changes in the spectrotemporal structure of lark <b>distress</b> <b>calls</b> and affected the condition-dependent nature of these signals. Virus bearers uttered significantly shorter and lower pitched calls than virus-free birds, giving even shorter calls when subject to greater physiological stress (higher H/L ratio), whereas virus-free individuals did the opposite. Call harshness was positively correlated with bird immune and body condition, independently of virus infection, whereas call pulse rate decreased in stressed birds. We hypothesize that healthy birds might reveal their ability to bear the costs of antipredator defense by means of long, harsh, and fast modulated <b>distress</b> <b>calls.</b> Infection not only affects individual state and morphology by means of gross lesions but also may alter a signal used in an antipredator context, thus potentially reducing bird fitness both directly (through disease) and indirectly (through increased predation).
