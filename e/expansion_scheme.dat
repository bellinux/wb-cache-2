5|$|In March 1935 {{the threat}} from Nazi Germany {{prompted}} a series of expansion schemes which pushed the number of squadrons up to 163 (as per <b>Expansion</b> <b>Scheme</b> M, the last before the outbreak of war) {{and the number of}} aircraft to 2,549. But it was never fully implemented, and Scheme F, 124 Squadrons and 1,736 aircraft, was the only scheme that ran its full course. It did produce modern aircraft and it made adequate provision for reserves (75 percent), but again, the bomber forces received no less than 50 percent which averaged 57 percent over all schemes. Maritime air units never made up more than 12 per cent of British air strength. From a pre-expansion strength of just five squadrons, four of which were flying boats, the figure of maritime squadrons rose to 18 by September 1939, with a strength of just 176 aircraft. Some 16 of these were allocated to trade defence, but given Trenchard's policy (which was still in place after his retirement) of developing bombers for the maritime arm which could bolster the air offensive, most were not specialised ASW aircraft, and the Air Ministry was thoroughly uninterested in any aircraft which fell outside the bomber function.|$|E
5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious <b>expansion</b> <b>scheme.</b> On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

40|$|We here revisit <b>expansion</b> <b>schemes</b> used {{in nuclear}} {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) for the calculation of effective Hamiltonians and propagators, namely, Magnus, Floquet, and Fer expansions. While all the <b>expansion</b> <b>schemes</b> are powerful methods there are subtle differences among them. To understand the differences, we performed explicit calculation for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling, cross-polarization, and rotary-resonance experiments in solid-state NMR. As the propagator from the Fer expansion {{takes the form of}} a product of sub-propagators, it enables us to appreciate effects of time-evolution under Hamiltonians with different orders separately. While 0 th-order average Hamiltonian is the same for the three <b>expansion</b> <b>schemes</b> with the three cases examined, there is a case that the 2 nd-order term for the Magnus/Floquet expansion is different from that obtained with the Fer expansion. The difference arises due to the separation of the 0 th-order term in the Fer expansion. The separation enables us to appreciate time-evolution under the 0 th-order average Hamiltonian, however, for that purpose, we use a so-called left-running Fer expansion. Comparison between the left-running Fer expansion and the Magnus expansion indicates that the sign of the odd orders in Magnus may better be reversed if one would like to consider its effect in order...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} handle large dense {{matrices}} arising {{in the context}} of integral equations efficiently, panel-clustering approaches (like the popular multipole expansion method) have proven to be very useful. These techniques split the matrix into blocks, approximate the kernel function on each block by a degenerate expansion, and discretize this expansion in order to find an efficient low-rank approximation of each block. Typical <b>expansion</b> <b>schemes</b> use the same expansion order in each block, and since the matrix approximation error has to be kept consistent with the discretization error, this allows us to handle n × n matrices by algorithms with a complexity of O(n log α n) for α ≥ 1. Recently, variable-order <b>expansion</b> <b>schemes</b> have been introduced, which choose different ranks for different blocks and have been demonstrated to reach a complexity of O(n) while keeping the matrix approximation error and the discretization error consistent. This paper introduces an algorithm which can construct variable-rank approximations for general matrices without the need of an in-depth analysis of the underlying operators: the matrix is fed into the algorithm, and the algorithm approximates it up to an arbitrary precision.
