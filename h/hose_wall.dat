50|$|The most desired use is the AV. The AV {{is made up}} of a {{piece of}} heavy rubber hose about 5 cm in {{diameter}} and up a 18 in or more (in some cases less) in length. A small screw cap attachment is fitted or drilled preferably {{in the middle of the}} housing. A piece of latex or silicone rubber (usually rough inside, but some cases smooth) then is put through the hose and pulled up at both ends. Another latex or silicone cone shaped attachment is placed on one end of the AV an held by a rubber band. on thee end of the cone a glass or plastic centrifudge tube is attached usually 15ml size). Through the cap attachment water usually around 54°C is filled until the AV is 1/2 full (temperature may vary from bull to bull). This water is between the inside rubber and the inside <b>hose</b> <b>wall</b> of the AV. A small amount of K-Y jelly or Vaseline is placed just inside on the unconed end and then it is smeared with a pipette or greasing stick. Finally in most cases and AV jacket is tied or attached onto the cone end to cover the cone and tube. This will help prevent cold shock to the semen by keeping the cone and tube warm. The collector then goes cautiously to the side of the bull when he is in mount, directs the bull's penis inside the AV by grabbing the sheath directly behind the extended penis (never touching the penis itself). The bull then ejaculates after his penis slides through the AV. The bull should be ejaculating through the AV into the cone of the AV so there is very little chance of temperature shock to the semen. after the bull has dismounted the AV should be held in the upright position so the semen runs into the tube onto the end of the cone. Then the tube is detached and placed upright in a water bath of about 29-32°C.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of liquid in a flexible hose {{is difficult to}} model because of complex interactions between the liquid and the <b>hose</b> <b>wall.</b> This results in two sets of coupled axial waves in the liquid and in the wall travelling at two different wavespeeds. A method for time domain modelling is described which represents wave propagation at the two different wavespeeds, including viscoelastic damping. Good agreement between model and measurement is obtained. Simple corrections are included for low-frequency and static effects including viscoelastic relaxation and non-linearities...|$|E
40|$|When {{air supply}} hoses {{are exposed to}} {{chemicals}} in workplaces, the chemicals {{in contact with the}} hose may permeate through the <b>hose</b> <b>wall</b> and contaminate air being inhaled through the hose. A new gravimetric test method has been developed to quantify the changes in permeation when a hose is subject to elevated temperatures. When Esdan PVC hose was challenged with methyethyl ketone at temperatures between 20 ꃠand 70 ꃠin 10 ꃠincrements, the permeation rate increased exponentially and the breakthrough time and lag time decreased exponentially. A simple exponential model was used to estimate these parameters at higher and lower temperatures. At 40 ꃬ significant permeation could occur within an 8 -hour shift. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fabric {{filters are}} used in the wide range of {{industrial}} technologies for cleaning of incoming or exhaust gases. To achieve maximal efficiency of the discrete phase separation and long lifetime of the filter hoses, it is necessary to ensure uniform load on filter surface and to avoid impacts of heavy particles with high velocities to the filter hoses. The paper deals with numerical simulation of two phase flow field in a large fabric filter. The filter is composed of six chambers with approx. 1600 filter hoses in total. The model was simplified to one half of the filter, the filter <b>hoses</b> <b>walls</b> were substituted by porous zones. The model settings were based on experimental data, especially on the filter pressure drop. Unsteady simulations with different turbulence models were done. Flow field together with particles trajectories were analyzed. The results were compared with experimenta...|$|R
40|$|For the {{prediction}} of acoustic performance of an engine intake system with porous woven <b>hose,</b> the <b>wall</b> impedance of the hose must be known {{in the presence of}} mean flow. Here, the acoustic impedance is inversely estimated from an overdetermined set of measured pressure transmission coefficients for specimens of different lengths and the reflection coefficient of end termination. The method involves only one measurement, and, as a result, it is very simple. The measured TL for samples with arbitrary conditions, arbitrary porous frequency, arbitrary length, and arbitrary mean flow condition, agree very well with values predicted from curve-fitted impedance data...|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} for storing vacuum hose is the [...] "Hide-A-Hose" [...] system, which uses suction {{to draw the}} hose into the vacuum tubing in the <b>wall</b> for storage. <b>Hose</b> lengths used are typically 30/40/50 ft (9/12/15 m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage. A scaled-down 10-foot (3 m) version (such as [...] "Spot by Vroom") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms. The original [...] "Vroom" [...] system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24 ft (7.3 m) hose, rather than storing the <b>hose</b> within the <b>wall</b> tubing.|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this procedure, the term "ARB " refers to the State of California Air Resources Board, and the term "ARB Executive Officer " refers to the Executive Officer of the ARB or his or her {{authorized}} representative or designate. This procedure is used to quantify the removal of liquid gasoline from the vapor passage of coaxial hoses equipped with a liquid removal device. It is applicable in all cases where a liquid removal system is required in conjunction with a Phase II balance system. This test procedure is explicitly not applicable to vapor assist type systems. 2 PRINCIPLE AND SUMMARY OF TEST PROCEDURE All gasoline is drained from the dispenser hose’s vapor passage and a measured amount of liquid gasoline, usually 150 ml, is then introduced into the vapor passage. After ten gallons of gasoline are dispensed the liquid remaining in the hose is measured and the amount removed determined by subtraction with consideration of liquid which may adhere to the <b>hose</b> <b>wall</b> or be lost by evaporation. 3 BIASES AND INTERFERENCES Pouring 150 ml of fuel into the vapor passage may cause some nozzles to shut off prematurely. This can be usually overcome by using a smaller volume. Allowing insufficient time for liquid to drain from the hose can cause errors in April 2000 TP- 201. 6 Page 1 measurement of the volume drained. 4 SENSITIVITY, RANGE, AND PRECISION Range of measurement of liquid removal is approximately from 0 to 15 ml removed per gallon dispensed; upper range depends on volume of gasoline lost due to evaporation and surface adhesion to the <b>hose</b> <b>wall</b> and on the ability of the nozzle to function without premature shutoff with 150 ml of gasoline in the vapor passage. 5 EQUIPMEN...|$|E
40|$|Modeling of wave {{propagation}} in hoses, unlike in rigid pipes or waveguides, introduces a coupling between the inside medium, the <b>hose</b> <b>wall,</b> {{and the outside}} medium, This alters the axial wave number and thence the corresponding effective speed of sound inside the hose resulting in sound radiation into the outside medium, also called the breakout or shell noise, The existing literature on the subject is such that a hose cannot be integrated into the,whole piping system made up of sections of hoses, pipes, and mufflers to predict the acoustical performance in terms of transmission loss (TL), The present paper seeks to fill this gap, Three one-dimensional coupled wave equations are written {{to account for the}} presence of a yielding wall with a finite lumped transverse impedance of the hose material, The resulting wave equation can readily be reduced to a transfer matrix form using an effective wave number for a moving medium in a hose section, Incorporating the effect of fluid loading due to the outside medium also allows prediction of the transverse TL and the breakout noise, Axial TL and transverse TL have been combined into net TL needed by designers, Predictions of the axial as well as transverse TL are shown to compare well with those of a rigorous 3 -D analysis using only one-hundredth of the computation time, Finally, results of some parametric studies are reported for engineers involved in the acoustical design of hoses.

Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's [...] "lucky string," [...] which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a <b>hose</b> into the <b>wall.</b> As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone to be washed out of the house as it promptly collapses. The brothers' only consolation {{is the fact that the}} mouse must finally be dead as their father's [...] "lucky string" [...] is found in the wreckage.|$|R
40|$|Till Rolls was {{commissioned}} by the Towner Art Gallery Eastbourne specifically for the exhibition Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive (2011). ‘Till Roll’s’ is typical of Jill Townsley's practice; it is often large in scale, installation or temporary, though the physical labour applied to its construction is generally excruciatingly repetitive. She {{is interested in the}} subjective results of repetitive action, such as ‘failure', ‘temporality', ‘erasure' and 'authorship'. She generally uses everyday materials, such as, plastic spoons, broom bristles or staple wire. In this work she has used 10, 000 till roll’s, each of which has its middle extruded from the center, to form a tall vertical cone. Each cone differs in height, from very small to 3 meters (10 ft) high. Each roll is placed on the floor to form a giant grid; 5. 7 meters square. This structure is reminiscent of a graph, though we have no access to what it is recording. Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive, is a group show of sculptors who obsessively use small scale repetitive processes to create large scale installations. The exhibition comprises five new commissions by: Elpida Hadzi-Vasileva Brendan Jamison Susie MacMurray Jill Townsley Henry Seaton (Rex Henry and Graham Seaton) It also features an earlier work by Claire Morgan. These artists are motivated by the need to compulsively repeat an action – in a labour intensive and painstaking way - to create a large scale installation composed of multiple elements. From MacMurray’s sculptural drawing made from corrugated <b>hose</b> to Hadzi-Vasileva’s <b>wall</b> of salmon skins, individual elements are transformed through repetition into something {{more than the sum of}} its parts...|$|R
