As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic <b>Glow</b> <b>Plugs</b> in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E

2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel. (<b>Glow</b> <b>plugs,</b> grid heaters and block heaters help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|E

50|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine, or <b>glow</b> engine, {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{internal}} combustion engine typically used in model aircraft, model cars and similar applications.

2500|$|Oldsmobile also {{introduced}} a 5.7L (350 cu-in, V8) diesel engine option on its Custom Cruiser, Delta 88 and 98 models in 1978 {{and a smaller}} 4.3L (260 cu-in, V8) displacement diesel on the 1979 Cutlass Salon and Cutlass Supreme/Cutlass Calais models. These were largely based on their gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, re-designed heads, fast <b>glow</b> <b>plugs,</b> and on the 5.7L, oversized cranks, main bearings, and wrist pins. There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no water separator in the fuel line), paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather, reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys, head bolt failures, {{and the use of}} aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. [...] 4.3L V6 diesels were also offered between 1982 and 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are lean burn engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E

A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> was required to avoid engine misfires when bulk gas temperature at the start of injection was less than 413 C. The distance between the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the spray edge, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature, and the bulk gas temperature were important factors in meeting two requirements for successful ignition: a minimum local temperature of 413 C and a minimum air/fuel vapour equivalence ratio of 0. 15 – 0. 35...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a hotter <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature; in cold weather, hotter plugs are needed. Since <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause rougher idling and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a hotter plug is required.|$|R

Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.|$|R
