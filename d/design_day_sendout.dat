Our work, InfoMe, is about understanding (a) how immigrant and refugee youth help others in everyday life—elders, friends, complete strangers—through information and technology, and (b) how these behaviors can be supported through youths’ designs for interactive technologies and services. We reflect on our work developing the Teen <b>Design</b> <b>Day</b> methodology with youth from Africa and Asia, and consider our approach in relation to others for supporting interaction design with youth. Teen <b>Design</b> <b>Days</b> is a scalable, portable methodology used in situ that enables investigators to explore concepts, test ideas, and create designs with youth, while meeting their developmental needs in safe settings and in culturally and gender appropriate ways.

30|$|Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) {{systems are}} often {{oversized}} {{in order to}} reduce design risk by ensuring that the system will cope with loads above the average year’s <b>design</b> <b>day</b> estimations [3].

40|$|Adrar {{is a city}} in the Sahara desert, in {{southern}} Algeria known for its hot and dry climate, where {{a huge amount of}} energy is used for air conditioning. The aim of this research is to simulate a single effect lithium bromide–water absorption chiller coupled to a double-glazed flat plate collector to supply the cooling loads for a house of 200 m 2 in Adrar. The thermal energy is stored in an insulated thermal storage tank. The system was designed to cover a cooling load of 10. 39 KW for <b>design</b> <b>day</b> of July. Thermodynamic model was established to simulate the absorption cycle. The results have shown that the collector mass flow rate has a negligible effect on the minimum required collector area, but it has a significant effect on the optimum capacity of the storage tank. The minimum required collector area was about 65. 3 m 2, which could supply the cooling loads for the sunshine hours of the <b>design</b> <b>day</b> for July. The operation of the system has also been considered after sunset by saving solar energy...|$|R

40|$|For {{residential}} buildings {{located in the}} subtropics, it is more challenging and {{difficult to deal with}} space latent cooling load than space sensible load, using a room air conditioner (RAC), partly due to hot and humid climates. This paper reports a simulation study on the characteristics of space cooling load and indoor humidity control for residences in the subtropics, using a building energy simulation program. Both the weather conditions and the typical arrangements of high-rise residential blocks in subtropical Hong Kong were used in the simulation study. The simulation results on both the space cooling load characteristics and the hourly application sensible heat ratio (SHR) in the living/dining room and the master bedroom in a selected west-facing apartment under different operating modes of RACs in the summer <b>design</b> <b>day</b> are presented. The problem of indoor humidity control due to the mismatching between an application SHR and an equipment SHR in the two rooms both in the summer <b>design</b> <b>day</b> and during part load operations and the influences of indoor furnishings acting as moisture capacitors on indoor RH level are discussed.

50|$|Architects and {{engineers}} use daylight factors in {{architecture and building}} design to assess the internal natural lighting levels as perceived on working planes or surfaces. They use this information to determine if light is sufficient for occupants to carry out normal activities.

50|$|Evaporative cooling is most {{effective}} when the relative humidity is on the low side, limiting its popularity to dry climates. Evaporative cooling raises the internal humidity level significantly, which desert inhabitants may appreciate as the moist air re-hydrates dry skin and sinuses. Therefore, assessing typical climate data is an essential procedure to determine the potential of evaporative cooling strategies for a building. The three most important climate considerations are dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and wet-bulb depression during the summer <b>design</b> <b>day.</b> It is important {{to determine if the}} wet-bulb depression can provide sufficient cooling during the summer <b>design</b> <b>day.</b> By subtracting the wet-bulb depression from the outside dry-bulb temperature, one can estimate the approximate air temperature leaving the evaporative cooler. It is important to consider that the ability for the exterior dry-bulb temperature to reach the wet-bulb temperature depends on the saturation efficiency. A general recommendation for applying direct evaporative cooling is to implement it in places where the wet-bulb temperature of the outdoor air does not exceed 22 °C (71.6 °F). However, in the example of Salt Lake City, the upper limit for the direct evaporative cooling on psychrometric chart is 20 °C (68 °F). Despite this lower value, this climate is still suitable for this technique.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{passive solar}} house design is {{cumbersome}} because of the effort required to vary the design parameters and interpret performance results. When this process is aided by building simulation software, the designer is not given adequate feedback on the relationships between key design parameters and their effects on passive solar performance. To improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process, the use of solar <b>design</b> <b>days</b> (SDDs) is explored. The days represent a cold sunny, cold cloudy, and warm sunny (shoulder season) day for the climate of interest. Unlike traditional equipment-sizing <b>design</b> <b>days,</b> the SDDs are used as performance indicators. Limiting the period that is studied can put the designer in touch with exactly how the window size, window type, thermal mass, and effective envelope U-value affect performance. While energy performance is a key metric, thermal comfort is also important. The warm sunny day will allow the user to prevent overheating and reduce cooling loads. Since there is a good correlation between cold sunny day performance and annual performance, it is adequate to design a house based on cold sunny day performance alone in the early design stages. This paper will explain how SDDs {{can be used as a}} tool to design {{passive solar house}}s and the associated methodology...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{building}} performance metrics {{consider a}} building as a standalone and static utility consumer. Voluntary green building certifications of districts generally aggregate the metrics of standalone and consuming buildings. There {{is a lack}} of performance metrics concerning the integration of critical services to a building and the utility networks supplying these critical services of electricity, natural gas and water. In order to achieve integration of energy systems, including storage based demand side management and rain water harvesting, a methodology is modelled for a typical office. The methodology requires building parameters to be combined and manipulated in order to create the proposed performance metrics. The building model is simulated for three periods of interest: a whole year, a winter <b>design</b> <b>day,</b> a summer <b>design</b> <b>day.</b> The proposed metrics enable operational management during peak and standard loads, as well as longer term analysis of the building performance. Operational management includes the role of storage and the responsiveness of a building during demand ramping or shedding. Over the longer term, the metrics indicate efficiency trends and guide design and investment decisions. It is found that electrical storage combined with demand side management reduces energy costs with no service disruptions. Rain water harvesting is also found to significantly reduce financial and energy costs, and given its current dearth of deployment, has high future potential...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the study of cold storage {{refrigeration}} plant and simulation of refrigeration system to evaluate the cooling load and annual energy consumption for cold storage applications. The specific temperature and humidity range is required for properly storing any particular food and thus facilitates its preservation for a longer duration of time. The present cold storage capacity in India is grossly inadequate and with a positive future outlook for the agro, food processing, retail and pharmaceutical industry there is urgent need to scale up and develop integrated cold chain facilities across the country. In this view, a simple methodology is presented to obtain the cooling load and energy consumption for a cold storage using an energy simulation tool “EnergyPlus”. Also the attempt {{has been made to}} minimize energy consumption of cold store by replacing the Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) with Poly-urethane Foam (PUF) insulation. The methodology has been validated against the actual data obtained from Penguin cold storage situated in Pune, India. It is found from the simulation results that the average reduction of cooling load for summer <b>design</b> <b>day</b> is 9. 78 % while for winter <b>design</b> <b>day</b> it is 9. 26 %, when 150 mm thick insulation of EPS is replaced by 100 mm PUF insulation. Due to this replacement the annual cooling energy is saved by Rs. 63875 with pay-back period of 6. 8 years...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} several real days {{belonging}} to a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) are proposed as <b>design</b> <b>days</b> for HVAC systems in summer conditions. A parameter, the equivalent temperature, that is a different combination of related values of hourly solar radiation, wet and dry bulb temperature, is defined. Real days with maximum values of these parameters are selected as <b>Design</b> Meteorological <b>Days</b> (DMDs) to evaluate summer cooling load. Results are analysed in terms of energetic performances of the system to identify the most suitable DMDs {{to be used in}} the design process. The DMD selection is based on the criterion of reducing HVAC part-load working periods and on the risk level to alter indoor design conditions. The approach uses the computer package Integrated ENergy Use Simulation (IENUS), specifically developed for the Mediterranean climate, to characterise both energetic and environmental aspects. Simulations are referred to a non-residential building designed on the base of energy saving criteria. Typical Meteorological Years are used both as meteorological data inputs as far as data base to select DMDs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
