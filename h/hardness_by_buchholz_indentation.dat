40|$|Social norms {{can help}} to foster {{cooperation}} and to overcome the free-rider problem in private provision of public goods. This paper focuses on the enforcement of social norms by a self-introduced punishment and reward scheme. We analyse if subjects achieve to implement a norm-enforcement mechanism at their own expense by applying the theory of non-governmental norm-enforcement <b>by</b> <b>Buchholz</b> et al. (2014) in a laboratory experiment. Based on their theory without central authority and endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a two-stage public good game: At the first stage subjects determine the strength of penalty/reward {{on their own and}} in the second stage they decide on their contributions to the public good. We find that the mechanism <b>by</b> <b>Buchholz</b> et al. (2014) leads to a higher public good contribution than without the use of any mechanism. Only in a few cases groups end up with a zero enforcement mechanism. This result indicates that subjects are apparently willing to contribute funds for implementing an enforcement mechanism. Moreover, higher enforcement parameters lead to higher public good contributions in the second stage, although too high enforcement parameters lead to unreachable theoretical optima. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} {{epoxy powder coating}} on the electrolytic galvanized steel sheet via electrostatic powder coating system. Normally, the film thickness and powder coverage of the coated powder is not optimum. It leads to non- protection of the parts from rusty and corrosion besides having many defects such as orange peel, rough surface, poor adhesion and inconsistencies of colour tone. In order to produce good coating quality, the processing parameters must be optimized. In this research, there have three variable parameters need to investigate. The variable parameters are total air volume, powder output and spraying distances. These parameters were screening to determine the significant effects to the coating quality. The screening result shows the spraying distance does not have significant effects and it was discarded. The experiments were carrying out to determine the optimum combination of powder output and total air volume. It is purposely to produce sample with good coating quality besides improved the first pass transfer efficiency (FPTE). All samples were tested using same processes that are pre-treatment, dry-off, powder spraying and curing. The method used to investigate the coating characteristic are thickness measurement, <b>Buchholz</b> <b>indentation</b> test, cross cut test, colour visual checking, particle cross-linking struture and surface profile analysis. The instruments {{used to evaluate the}} samples are coating thickness gauge, Buchholz indentor, multi blade cutting tools, spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and surface profiler. The experimental result shows the combination of 4. 0 m³/h of total air volume and 150 g/min of powder output produce good coated sample with optimum thickness and colour tone. It also has good particle crosslinking structure and surface profiler. The coating indentation resistant and adhesion for this sampe is able to protect the galvanized steel from corrosion and rusty...|$|R
