25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{marriage}} of Wladislaus II (Jagiełło) to Jadwiga, daughter of Louis I of Hungary, Lithuania was united with the kingdom of Poland. In , broad privileges were extended to Lithuanian Jews including freedom of religion and commerce on equal terms with the Christians. Under the rule of Wladislaus II, Polish Jews had increased in numbers and attained prosperity. However, religious persecution gradually increased, as the dogmatic clergy pushed for less official tolerance, pressured by the Synod of Constance. In 1349 pogroms took place in many towns in Silesia. There were accusations of blood libel by the priests, and new riots against the Jews in Poznań in 1399. Accusations of blood libel by another fanatic priest led to the riots in Kraków in 1407, although the royal guard hastened to the rescue. Hysteria caused by Black Death led to additional 14th-century outbreaks of violence against the Jews in Kalisz, Kraków and Bochnia. Traders and artisans jealous of Jewish prosperity, and fearing their rivalry, supported the harassment. In 1423 the statute of Warka forbade Jews the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> against letters of credit or mortgage and limited their operations exclusively to loans made on security of moveable property. In the 14th and 15th centuries rich Jewish merchants and moneylenders leased the royal mint, salt mines and the collecting of customs and tolls. The most famous of them were Jordan and his son Lewko of Kraków in the 14th century and Jakub Slomkowicz of Luck, Wolczko of Drohobycz, Natko of Lvov, Samson of Zydaczow, Josko of Hrubieszow and Szania of Belz in the 15th century. For example, Wolczko of Drohobycz, King Ladislaus Jagiello's broker, was the owner of several villages in the Ruthenian voivodship and the soitys (administrator) of the village of Werbiz. Also Jews from Grodno were in this period owners of villages, manors, meadows, fish ponds and mills. However {{until the end of the}} 15th century agriculture as a source of income played only a minor role among Jewish families. More important were crafts for the needs of both their fellow Jews and the Christian population (fur making, tanning, tailoring).|$|E

40|$|This study empirically {{assessed}} {{the success of}} co-operative societies’ housing provision for their members in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study was based on questionnaire survey conducted on institution-based co-operative societies that engage in housing procurement for members using different methods such as land acquisition, housing development, <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan,</b> purchase <b>of</b> building materials or purchase of complete housing. Data were collected from members and principal officers of 97 institution-based co-operative societies in Ikeja, Lagos State. Data were analyzed with basic descriptive statistical tools, 5 -Point Likert scale and presented with tables and percentages. The overall success rate was found by finding {{the average of the}} success rate of each method. This is compared with the impression of the stakeholders with the achievement of co-operative societies in providing housing for their members over the years. It was found contrary to popular believe that co-operative societies had performed well, the success rate had not been impressive and this is evidenced by the aggregate 38. 3 % of success rate of the different approaches put together. The analysis also showed that <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> and private project development were considered to be more successful amongst other strategies adopted by the co-operative societies.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} to {{what extent}} and in what forms loan applications from {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in a risk averse banking environment can be assessed defensively by lending officers (LOs). The paper also identifies triggering mechanisms behind defensive SME loan assessment behaviour and its’ possible effects on the bank and the LOs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper relies on a case study of a major Swedish commercial bank undergoing strategy and control system change during the recent financial crisis. The empirical evidence was collected through interviews with 76 LOs in three branch offices and a focus group interview session. Findings - In a risk averse banking environment, LOs can be prone to assess SME loan applications defensively to a noteworthy extent. Such defensiveness comes in different forms: denial of loan applications, <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> with collateral or high interest rates, or <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> only to clients with most of their financial affairs in the bank. External and internal mechanisms jointly trigger defensive loan assessment behaviour. The possible effects include fewer Type II errors and more Type I errors for the bank, while LOs avoid change and blame. Originality/value - Overall, this study contributes to the literature by revealing triggering mechanisms, forms and effects related to the multifaceted construct of defensive loan assessment behaviour among LOs in a commercial bank, who handle applications from SMEs.
