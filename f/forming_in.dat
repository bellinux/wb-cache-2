5|$|New York Dolls is the 1973 debut studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. By {{the time of}} the album's recording, the band had {{developed}} a following by playing regularly in lower Manhattan after <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> 1971. However, they were unappealing to record companies because of their onstage cross-dressing and vulgarity, while most record producers were reluctant to work with them. For shock value, the group was photographed in exaggerated drag on the album cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebel groups}} were collectively known as ḥarakat al-′iṣābāt, and each {{individual}} ′iṣābā {{was composed of}} anywhere between 30 and 100 rebels known as mujahidin and were led by a ra'īs (commander), who was often a local notable or {{the head of a}} major clan. Individual ′iṣābāt began <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the countryside between Aleppo and Anatolia in 1919 to counter French advances, but Hananu gradually consolidated them into his network.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, a number of bands from Louisiana (particularly New Orleans with its metal scene) took these influences and developed the style that would be known as sludge, [...] specifically Eyehategod (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1988), Crowbar (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1989 as The Slugs) and Acid Bath (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1991). On the East Coast, Buzzov*en (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1989), 16 (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1990) and Grief (<b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1991) adopted a slower-paced approach to the emerging genre.|$|R

5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} and sustaining the Athens musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art. The {{great majority of}} Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with the}} University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had been}} formed in October 1941, the British 1st Airborne Division, {{commanded}} by Major-General George Hopkinson, had never before fought as a complete division. The only units with any combat experience were the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had fought with distinction as an independent brigade in North Africa and in Operation Fustian during the Allied invasion of Sicily, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, understrength with only two battalions, which had also fought in Sicily during Operation Ladbroke. Both brigades had suffered heavy casualties in Sicily and were in no condition to undertake any further assault landings. Of the division's other brigades, the 2nd and 4th Para Brigades, were untried in battle. Also, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was the only full strength unit, as the 4th Parachute Brigade had only two battalions, with its third battalion still <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} 27th Battalion {{returned}} to Egypt, where the AIF undertook {{a period of}} training and re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During this time the AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four– with a fifth <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> Australia– and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split up in this manner and the 27th Battalion remained intact.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ava {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclones ever recorded in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. It was the first named storm of the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. <b>Forming</b> <b>in</b> early June, Hurricane Ava eventually reached Category5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the first Pacific hurricane to do so in June and the earliest ever in a season. Its central pressure made it the most intense known Pacific hurricane at the time. Despite its intensity, Hurricane Ava stayed at sea without significant impact.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the lung tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the lung tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the lung.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and unsettled weather indicated that a storm was <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity. The disturbance strengthened into a tropical storm on October 12 to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a high pressure area building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day it passed just east of Bermuda. It weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical near Newfoundland {{a couple of days}} later.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s a {{large number}} of notable blues/blues-rock bands was formed: Sirova Koža (also known internationally as Raw Hide), <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1982; Point Blank and Blues Trio, both <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1983; Zona B, <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> 1987; Di Luna Blues Band, formed 1989.

5000|$|The season had a late start, as {{the first}} system did not form until late June {{for the first time}} since 1973. [...] The last {{tropical}} cyclone dissipated in mid-December. A total of 26 tropical depressions <b>formed</b> this year <b>in</b> the Western Pacific, of which 23 became tropical storms.

5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?").

5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E

5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones <b>forming</b> <b>in</b> the Atlantic {{during the summer}} and fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, including one that began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 Texas {{hurricane}} was {{an intense}} tropical cyclone of the 1949 Atlantic hurricane season. <b>Forming</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific Ocean on September 27, the storm crossed into the Gulf of Mexico—one {{of only a}} handful of known storms to do so—and began to intensify. It ultimately peaked with winds corresponding to high-end Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall near Freeport, Texas, on the morning of October 4. It rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated several days later. Damage from the storm was moderate, although the hurricane temporarily cut off the city of Galveston from the mainland. Rice crops suffered extensive damage, with losses estimated at up to $10million (1949USD, $ USD). Two people died due to the hurricane.|$|E
