50|$|The dollar glut is a {{term for}} the {{accumulation}} of American dollars outside of the United States as a reserve currency, contrasted with the <b>dollar</b> <b>gap,</b> {{which led to the}} creation of the Marshall Plan following World War II. The eventual shift to a dollar glut forced the end of the gold standard in the United States and led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the British state's international economic {{strategy in the}} postwar period of Attlee's governments 1945 - 51. It assesses the international political determinants of economic management in the Chancellorships of Dalton, Cripps, and Gaitskell. Special attention is paid to a critical examination of the orthodox interpretations of postwar British action which claim that the British state capitulated to American demands. The evidence of this thesis suggests that this claim is incorrect. The Labour government rejected a radical socialist solution to the economic problems facing Britain in 1945. To realise Labour's programme of domestic reconstruction the state required rapid accumulation which could only be achieved if Britain could reconstruct an adequate international payments system to facilitate trade and secure regular imports of essential commodities and raw materials. Although the postwar structure of production and trade left Western Europe heavily dependent on the economic resources of the United States, Britain had a strong bargaining position which rested on London's role as the primary financial centre and the UK's initial political and economic strength in relation to the other nations of Western Europe. Britain exploited these strengths to subvert the American objectives of world domination and ultimately coax the USA into accepting an Atlantic partnership to the mutual interest of each party. Whilst Britain's long-term objective was to re-establish sterling as a world currency, this objective should not be seen as simply serving US wishes or realising the interests of the City of London against 'national interests'. The objective was based on a material necessity, to overcome the primary barrier to accumulation which was the inappropriate structure of production and trade experienced in the <b>dollar</b> <b>gap.</b> Britain therefore used dollar aid to restructure trade, stimulate production, and reduce the <b>dollar</b> <b>gap</b> to gain some degree of independence from the United States...|$|E
40|$|The Pew Center {{estimates}} {{that as of}} July 2008, {{state and local governments}} in the United States had promised current and future retirees $ 3. 34 trillion in benefits but had only $ 2. 35 trillion of projected assets to pay for them. The investment losses that public employee pension funds experienced during the market downturn of 2008 - 09 made the trillion <b>dollar</b> <b>gap</b> much larger. In this paper I discuss how the pension funding gap has developed, compare the situation in California with that of other states, and discuss {{the ways in which the}} state government and local governments in California are responding to the increasing strains pension obligations place on their finances. I recommend that the constitution of California be amended to forbid the state and all local governments from ever again issuing pension obligation bonds, and to forbid the state of California, as well as all local governments within the state, from ever again offering their employees defined benefit pension plans...|$|E

His 2010 study, [...] "Profiling the Professionals: Who's Serving Our Communities?", revealed that a twenty thousand <b>dollar</b> wage <b>gap</b> disparity persists between the salaries of men and women working for Jewish organizations.|$|R
50|$|The US 71 upgrade {{involved}} removing all at-grade intersections and constructing interchanges and overpasses at 15 sites between Harrisonville and Lamar. The two-year project {{represented a}} shift in funding priorities for MoDOT which in 2007, announced indefinite postponement of its portion of the Bella Vista bypass project, citing a $139-million <b>dollar</b> funding <b>gap</b> in Arkansas between construction costs and toll revenues, and Arkansas' commitment to only a two-lane bypass constructed over six years. MoDOT announced the Joplin-to-Kansas City upgrade of US 71 in August 2010, {{to be done with}} the intention of bringing the I-49 designation to Missouri.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on a bank's {{specific}} {{assets and liabilities}} (e.g., fixed or floating rate), NII may {{be more or less}} sensitive to changes in interest rates. If the bank's liabilities reprice faster than its assets, then it is said to be [...] "liability-sensitive." [...] Further, the bank is asset-sensitive if its liabilities reprice more slowly than its assets in a changing interest-rate environment. The exposure of NII to changes in interest rates can be measured by the <b>dollar</b> maturity <b>gap</b> (DMG), which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets that reprice and the dollar amount of liabilities that reprice within a given time period.|$|R
40|$|The {{first attempt}} at European {{economic}} reconstruction after 1945 culminated in the economic crisis of 1947 (Tumlir, La Haye 1981). Due to state control over prices and production {{and the lack of}} sound money for both internal and external transactions, Europe had, to a large extent, returned to the stage of barter trade. This paper addresses the strategies chosen to overcome the shortage of international liquidity, the so-called <b>dollar</b> <b>gap,</b> during the second and successful attempt at European economic reconstruction from 1947 onwards. It focuses on those aspects which relate directly to the transition from bilateral barter to multilateral trade involving money, i. e. on the liberalisation of trade and payments. Since most early steps to remove restrictions on external trade and payments in Germany and Europe were initiated by the U. S. and implemented on a Western European level, this paper discusses these first measures in a European context before the emphasis shifts to the question why West Germany became a genuine pacemaker for the liberalisation of cross-border transactions from 1953 onwards. As a first step towards a more ambitious study, this paper provides an - admittedly theory-laden - description of some major aspects of the chosen subject rather than an in-depth theoretical analysis or a thorough evaluation of all historical evidence available. ...|$|E
