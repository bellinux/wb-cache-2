5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care costs, less than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E

Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to americium, and also <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as (η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E
5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all. Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet heavy in gymnosperms, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be <b>expected</b> <b>for</b> mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E
