5000|$|The 5th and 6th {{generations of}} the Chevrolet Corvette had <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> {{composed}} of balsa sandwiched between sheets of carbon fiber reinforced plastic.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} presented by this project was the <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> since in left hand drive, the driver had the most space available. The engine and gearbox offset had to be reversed with the use of Tickford engineered brackets, and unique <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> sections, to achieve the necessary space for the driver in RHD. In addition, an all new dashboard and interior trimmings had to be installed. In effect, TVE re-manufactured the Mustang at a cost of A$4 million remaining the biggest ever project for Tickford in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Pam-Crash {{was used}} to design a steel <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> {{structure}} to meet torsion and bending stiffness requirements while reducing its weight by 50% {{and the number of}} parts by 70%.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The article {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} the studies on material vibration propagation in <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> of the passenger car. The purpose was to analyse the vibration signals in multiple measuring points. The time-frequency distribution of the signals allows to identification the dominant component of the signal useful for material natural frequency calculation. Design/methodology/approach: The investigations were conducted based on the modified method of experimental and operating modal analysis. The investigation comprised 3 steps: research and measurements of vibration accelerations in a vertical direction perpendicular to the horizontal surface of vehicle in four selected points (impact excitation), analysis of the time courses of the vibration response, signal processing {{and analysis of the}} time-frequency distribution of the vibrationFindings: The distribution of the signal allows to identify the dominant frequency band. For the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> it is low frequencies, between 20 and 40 Hz. In this band the natural frequencies of the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> material can be identificationResearch limitations/implications: Number of the acceleration sensors and impossibility of the impact excitation signal recorded. Originality/value: Application of the modified method of experimental and operating modal analysis for the vehicle frame and car body. Research on the material properties influence on the vehicle vibration research.

5000|$|The front {{passenger}} seat and {{a section of}} <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> must be removed to perform a tune up because {{there is not enough}} room to remove spark plug leads or spark plugs.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformation}} {{is made possible}} by a centrally located electric motor, which stretches the vehicle with the help of two mechanical screw-and-nut gears by exactly 746 millimetres to its full extended length of 3.74 metres. The longitudinal members run on low-friction precision rollers and disappear like a drawer {{in the rear of the}} <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> Despite its variable length the engineers succeeded in designing the adjustable <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> with the torsional rigidity necessary for a roadster. To ensure absolute operational safety the extension mechanism also features self-locking safety latches. The car lacks a roof and doors.|$|R
50|$|Stampings and {{assemblies}} including hoods, roofs, liftgates, side apertures, fenders and <b>floor</b> <b>pans.</b> These provided {{parts for}} the many Chrysler vehicles, including {{in recent years the}} Dodge Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram Trucks.|$|R
50|$|The Sabre moulds {{ended up}} the {{property}} of a nearby company. The company later produced the FRA Mini based on the monocoque <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> of the Sabre moulds. The FRA Minis have the same shortened floorpan as the sabre sprint.|$|R
25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{he started}} to make the open Sonic model which no longer relied on the Beetle <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> but had a proper space frame. Later {{versions}} could have VW Straight-4 or Renault 25 engines. A fixed head coupé version was also made.|$|R

50|$|All models {{share the}} same hood, fenders, <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> lower door panels, rocker panels, engine {{compartment}} and front end. In mid-1971, Chevrolet introduced an optional GT package for hatchback and Kammback models, which included the RPO L11 two-barrel 140 engine, F41 handling option, special tires and trim.|$|R
5000|$|Rust is {{an issue}} for the Montecarlo and Scorpion. [...] Unless kept in a dry {{environment}} active prevention is required to fend off rust. The firewall and wheel wells are common locations for rust. [...] Rusted <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> are {{a major cause of}} early Montecarlo/Scorpion demise.|$|R
50|$|Steel or {{aluminum}} cooking pans can be {{coated with}} a substance such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) {{in order to minimize}} food sticking to the <b>pan</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1991 {{model was}} {{completely}} restyled—It replaced the 1977-based rectilinear design with rounded, more aerodynamic sheetmetal. While {{the body and}} interior were all new, excluding the Anti-Lock Braking System, the chassis and powertrain were carried over from the 1990 model. Several major components (including the <b>floor</b> <b>pan)</b> are entirely interchangeable between 1977 and 1996.|$|R
5000|$|On the 6th {{episode in}} the 9th season of the British {{motoring}} program Top Gear, James May welds together a Saab 9000 and an Alfa Romeo 164 to make a stretch limousine. He said the two cars should be entirely compatible {{because they have the}} same wheelbase and <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> It was nicknamed 'Salfa Romeaab' ...|$|R
50|$|A small {{sports car}} {{originally}} made by Cook Brothers using a Volkswagen <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> In 1983 Peter Clapham of Fibreglass Daytona Limited acquired the moulds. 30 kits {{were made by}} Cook Brothers and another 17 by Daytona. Six of the Daytona made cars were targa topped. In 1991 Daytona sold the moulds to a person from Rotorua.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Omni 024 was a {{modified}} version of the popular Dodge Omni made from 1979 to 1982. Analogous to the VW Scirocco, this car was a lower, sportier 3-door hatchback version of the Chrysler/Simca Horizon, using the four-door hatchback's <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> and chassis as a basis. The cars were designed in-house at the prompting of Lee Iacocca.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the Manxter 2+2 and Manxter DualSport were born. These two {{new models}} are modernizations of the {{original}} design, but are sized for a full-length Beetle <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> (and the DualSport can also {{be based on a}} Super Beetle chassis, unlike any other Manx model). Custom versions for higher-power engines and other variations are also available.|$|R
50|$|The drivetrain, suspension, <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> {{and many}} of the body panels of the 262C were taken {{directly}} from the Volvo 260 sedan, with Bertone building the roof pillars, roof pan, windshield surround, cowl, and the upper parts of the doors. The roof of the 262C is about 10 cm lower than that of the 260 sedan.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1973, {{because of}} the oil crisis Peugeot {{presented}} the 504 L. It featured a coil sprung live rear axle and a smaller 1796 cc engine rated at [...] ( [...] for Automatic). The different rear axle required somewhat more space; this required some alterations to the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> which meant marginally less boot space and rear headroom.|$|R
50|$|Manufactured in Wolfsburg, West Germany (1968-74), Hannover, West Germany (1974-83), Puebla, Mexico (1970-80), and Jakarta, Indonesia (1973-80), the Type 181 shared its {{mechanicals}} with Volkswagen's Type 1 (Beetle) and the pre-1968 Volkswagen Microbus, its <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> {{with the}} Type 1 Karmann Ghia, and its concept with the company's Kübelwagen, {{which had been}} used by the German military during World War II.|$|R
50|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} design was of semi-trailing arm configuration and, similarly {{to most of the}} body and <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> structure aft of the A-Pillar, was shared between the 1000 and Type 110. However, the front suspension of the Typ 110 was a new double-wishbone design with longer wishbones, better noise isolation and longer wheel travel than those of the 1000 models.|$|R
50|$|Molded carpet {{generally}} {{refers to}} the carpets used in the interiors of cars. The molded carpet is designed to hug the floorpans {{so there are no}} pockets of loose fitting carpet. The process of creating the molded carpet requires the original <b>floor</b> <b>pans</b> and having the carpet laid upon the pans with a backing in between. There are generally two types of backings, poly backing and mass backing. Mass backing is the original type of backing that most car makers use. It's thicker and more rubber-like than poly backing. Poly backing is lighter, easier to bend and more mesh like than mass backing. Some molded carpets come with jute backing where your feet rest on the <b>floor</b> <b>pans.</b> This helps prevent the carpet from wearing out prematurely because the majority of the wear is where feet contact the carpet. The jute padding also helps prevent mildew which was more of a problem in older leaking cars than modern cars.|$|R
50|$|The W {{platform}} was updated in 2004 {{rather than}} being replaced by a stretched Epsilon platform, as had been planned. Metal fabrication of the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> for W-body cars were performed at the Parma Metal Center in Parma, Ohio. The cars were built at GM's Oshawa Car Assembly. The transverse use of GM's small-block engine in the W-bodies was a major addition for 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Cosmo was Mazda's largest rotary-powered coupe, {{based on}} the LA series Mazda Luce <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> and mechanics, but {{slightly}} heavier due to body design and more luxurious appointments, including a five-link rear suspension and rear disc brakes. It was available with the 12A and 13B engines. This series Cosmo was joined by the short-lived Mazda Roadpacer, a large, heavy sedan powered only by a rotary engine.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{non-stick}} pans use Teflon; other non-stick coatings {{have become}} available. For example, {{a mixture of}} titanium and ceramic can be sandblasted onto the <b>pan</b> <b>surface,</b> and then fired at 2000 C to produce a non-stick ceramic coating.|$|R
50|$|David Coward {{was hired}} from Autocar {{magazine}} {{where he was}} working as an illustrator. Prior to that he had worked at coachbuilder James Young. Coward refined Rascanu’s design by lowering the side window line and deepening the windscreen to give the car a more contemporary appearance. The body was also lowered three inches between the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> and the roof and four inches {{were added to the}} width.|$|R
5000|$|Ken Gross, a {{director}} of the Petersen Automotive Museum, noted that [...] "the softly sprung Met wallows like most larger American cars of its day," [...] and he has warned against [...] "rust, especially in the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> and lower fenders," [...] and [...] "electrical gremlins." [...] British-made mechanical parts were available on the unspecified date of his article's publication, but he said that sheet-metal was [...] "a challenge." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{cooperation}} with Fiat ended, Citroën designed its own platform, and {{subsequent to the}} takeover of Citroën by Peugeot {{in the wake of}} the 1974 oil crisis, the renamed [...] "Projet VD (Voiture Diminuée)" [...] became the Citroën Visa, incorporating the <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> of the Peugeot 104 and using the 104 engine, transmission (under the engine) and chassis. The Visa thus became the first model under PSA Peugeot Citroën's platform-sharing policy.|$|R
50|$|The {{depth of}} the oil will vary {{depending}} on the food being cooked. When frying battered fish or chicken, for example, the oil generously covers the inner <b>pan</b> <b>surface,</b> but when frying pancakes, the oil is but a thin film to keep the batter from sticking.|$|R
50|$|The Mini was {{designed}} as a monocoque shell with welded seams visible {{on the outside of the}} car running down the A and C pillars, and between the body and the <b>floor</b> <b>pan.</b> Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally.|$|R
50|$|Vauxhall, from 1978 until 1979, {{offered the}} Cavalier coupé in {{convertible}} format called the Centaur. Only 118 {{of these were}} made and fewer than 30 were believed to have survived by 2007. The cars were developed by Magraw Engineering and sold through Vauxhall dealerships on behalf of Crayford. The Centaur is basically a Cavalier GLS coupé 2-litre with the hard roof replaced with a soft top leaving a T-bar for strength. The <b>floor</b> <b>pan</b> was also strengthened.|$|R
2500|$|A {{stretched}} {{version of the}} Rover 75—initially called Vanden Plas, then simply Limousine—was introduced in 2002. Developed in conjunction with specialist vehicle builder [...] in Walsall, England, the model was stretched by 200mm in the rear <b>floor</b> <b>pan,</b> with longer rear doors. The extra length, and the fitment of the new premium grille were the only visual clues to the changes made. Available only in Connoisseur specification, production moved to Longbridge after an initial short run by the coach-building partner.|$|R
