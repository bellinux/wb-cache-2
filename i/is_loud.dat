5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E
5|$|In Shaanxi in {{the north}} of China, drum {{ensembles}} accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens of musicians. In Korea, a style of folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.|$|E

After Dillon's death, Morse helps Ripley reach {{the top of the}} furnace so she can kill the Alien Queen and then herself by deliberately falling into the vat of molten lead. At {{the end of the film}} he is led away by Weyland-Yutani personnel, the only surviving resident of Fury 161.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

25|$|Green Goblin - Has a crush on/on-and-off {{relationship}} with Harley Quinn. Hosts Goblin Bloggin {{and has a}} devotion to Willem Dafoe. Mostly shown to have an idiotic personality. He <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> and sarcastic, and enjoys alcoholic beverages. In Zero Hour, it is revealed that Goblin is this way by his own choice, as Stan's place allows {{the characters in the}} comic book universes to choose how they act in the linked world that the bar provides. While most of the characters chose to act in a manner reminiscent of their comic book and/or movie incarnations, Norman Osborn did not, resulting in the comedic and zany personality he shows in the series. He is still known to be a scientist, as mentioned by Lex himself during Zero Hour, but normally does not display these traits due to his more comedic role.|$|E
25|$|The third (or {{technically}} {{fourth or}} fifth) primary melody {{in a march}} is called the trio. The trio is described as the main melody of the march. It is often played legato style in a softer dynamic, and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. The trio is the most contrasting section, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody is often repeated once at a softer dynamic, or not repeated at all and goes right to the next section. Generally, it is played quietly for the first (or second) playthrough, then the next has a piccolo playing over the trio melody, and in the final playthrough, it <b>is</b> <b>loud.</b> In almost all cases, the trio modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat {{is added to the}} key signature. Again, this is for the purpose of contrast and makes the trio more memorable to the listener. The fact that the key is now flatter also offers a more relaxing feel for those trios with softer instrumentation. For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major. This key is maintained {{to the end of the}} piece.|$|E

500|$|Loud was {{recorded}} in various recording studios worldwide including the Larrabee Sound Studios, The Village and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Platinum Sound Recording Studios, and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and The Bunker Studios in Paris. In September 2010, during a webchat with her fansite Rihannadaily.com, Rihanna announced that the album would be called Loud, saying [...] "get Loud everybody, get crazy, get excited, because I'm pumped. I'm just gonna be me, because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me <b>is</b> <b>Loud!</b> Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic." [...] While Rihanna was filming Battleship, she explained {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight, [...] "Loud is, the word, the name of the album definitely reflects the attitude of it, it's really sassy and flirty and it grabs your attention and that's why I enjoy it. It takes you through a really really interesting ride. So colorful the album." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Olivia Banner of Signs, medical {{journals}} generally had positive {{reviews of the}} novel for its depiction of the inner lives of intersex people. Writing in Archives of Disease in Childhood, Simon Fountain-Polley praised the novel, writing: [...] "All clinicians, and families who have faced gender crises or difficult life-changing decision on identity should read this book; delve into an emotional trip of discovery—where the slightest direction change could lead to myriad different lives." [...] Abraham Bergman wrote in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine: [...] "Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot imagine a more authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions usually take place in limited and structured setting such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children's voices as they are expressed in books. In Middlesex, the voice <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> and clear." [...] Banner noted {{that most of the}} reviews in intersex and queer publications praised Middlesex. She posited that the problematic issues of a [...] "heteromasculine-identified narrator" [...] and the [...] "fact that it was authored by a heterosexual man" [...] may have been outweighed by the necessity for an appropriate reading that [...] "destigmatizes ambiguous sex".|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is portrayed}} as the everyman of the group, as the show's website {{describes}} him as an [...] "average, American 4th grader". Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt satirically. Stan is modeled after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. They are best friends, and their friendship, symbolically intended to reflect Parker and Stone's friendship, is a common topic throughout the series. Eric Cartman (usually nicknamed by his surname only) <b>is</b> <b>loud,</b> obnoxious, and amoral, often portrayed as an antagonist. His anti-Semitic attitude {{has resulted in a}} progressive rivalry with Kyle, although the deeper reason is the strong clash between Kyle's strong morality and Cartman's complete lack of such. Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech. During the show's first five seasons, Kenny would die in nearly every episode before returning in the next with little-to-no definitive explanation given. He was written out of the show's sixth season in 2002, re-appearing in the season finale. Since then, Kenny's death has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were in the third grade. In the season four episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] (2000), they entered the fourth grade, but have remained ever since.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "The Open Door is a muddle of affections. Sonically, however, it captures the Evanescence mythos {{better and more}} {{consistently}} than the first album - after all, Lee now has no apologies of being the thinking man's nu-metal chick, now that she's a star". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the album [...] "less fun", [...] and {{said some of the}} songs are similar to each other. St. Louis Post-Dispatchs Sara Berry critiqued, [...] " [...] sound remains essentially the same: the strange but amicable marriage of churning guitar riffs to lead singer Amy Lee's silky soprano". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called the album a 45-minute [...] "romantic piece" [...] and said, [...] "if [...] featured more open-throated crooning and less teeth-gritting anger it would be a much more interesting record". She also added that the sound of the album gets [...] "black and blacker" [...] and, [...] "Lyrics tend toward repetition of words like 'darkness,' 'haunting,' and 'rage'". Christa Titus of Billboard called it a [...] "far more nuanced, moody and richly textured effort" [...] than Fallen. Postmedia News gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "While it's similar in style and sound to its predecessor, The Open Door loses the punchy power rifts and instead persuades the listener with piano and airy vocals". Andre Farias of Christianity Today admitted that [...] "The sound <b>is</b> <b>loud,</b> yes, but it's almost indistinguishable from its predecessor—a disappointment considering the opus was nearly three-and-a-half years in the making".|$|E
2500|$|Governments {{may have}} {{standards}} for vehicle-mounted sirens. For example, in California, sirens are designated Class A or Class B. [...] A Class A siren <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> {{enough that it}} can be mounted nearly anywhere on a vehicle. Class B sirens are not as loud and must be mounted on a plane parallel to the level roadway and parallel to the direction the vehicle travels when driving in a straight line.|$|E

2500|$|When {{played in}} its upper register, the fife <b>is</b> <b>loud</b> and piercing, yet also {{extremely}} small and portable. [...] According to some reports, {{a band of}} fifes and drums can be heard up to [...] away over artillery fire. Because of these qualities, European armies from the Renaissance on found it useful for signaling on the battlefield. Armies from Switzerland and southern Germany {{are known to have}} used the fife (German: Soldatenpfeife) as early as the 15th century. Swiss and German mercenaries were hired by monarchs throughout Western Europe, and they spread the practice of military fifing. The fife was a standard instrument in European infantries by the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Next {{comes the}} breakstrain or breakup strain (sometimes called the dogfight or interlude), {{making it the}} 4th main melody heard. [...] This strain <b>is</b> <b>loud,</b> intense, and marcato. The break strain's purpose {{can be found in}} its title. The breakstrain {{literally}} breaks a gap between the trio sections. It offers contrast to the usually softer trio melodies and generates excitement for the listener. Most breakstrains resemble a conversation between the upper woodwinds and the low brass. The final measures of the breakstrain typically contain tension-building chords or chromatic motifs. The breakstrain is usually 16 bars long, {{as in the case of}} Hands Across the Sea, but marches such as The Washington Post and The Interlochen Bowl have 8 bar breakstrains. On the Mall has a twelve bar breakstrain, as does The Purple Pageant. The Thunderer has a 15 bar breakstrain. Marches with 20 bar breakstrains include Fairest of the Fair and Invincible Eagle. The Stars and Stripes Forever in fact has a twenty-four bar breakstrain.|$|E
