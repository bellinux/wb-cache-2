40|$|Citation: Nixon, Ivan L. Variations in {{the mouth}} parts of some Hymenoptera. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1903. Introduction: The group of the order Hymenoptera {{considered}} in the present paper {{is known as the}} Anthophila,a name signifying lover of flowers and indicative of their food habits. In order that they may procure their food they have mouth parts peculiarly adapted to the gathering of honey. This group is also characterized by having the basal joint of the posterior tarsi dilated into an oblong or sub-triangular plate which is generally hirsute on the inside and provided with instruments for collecting and carrying pollen. In this group the jaws are strong, being varied in different species according to the work done by the particular species; the maxillae and labium are elongated and often transformed into a proboscis capable of being folded up several times beneath the head, the labium being pilose at the extremity. This group Anthophila is divided into two families, Andrenidae and Apidae; the first family may be defined as the short tongued bees and the second as the long tongued bees. In the Andrenidae the mentum is elongated and the labium at its extremity small and either spear shaped or cordate; with a small ear shaped lobe on each side, and being either straight or very slightly denexed in some and reflexed in others; the labium and terminal maxillary lobes not forming an elongated proboscis. The palpi are jointed, the joints being cylindrical and longer than wide; the labial palpi are four jointed and are similar to the maxillary palpi which are six jointed. The mandibles are simple or terminated by one or two notches. The insects composing the family Apidae have the mentum long, with the abium at its extremity forming an elonuted, slender seta, reflexed when at rest, and as long or longer than the mentum, with two small; lateral filaments, and forming with the maxillae, an elongated proboscis, capable of being porrected in front of the head when in action, or folded up beneath the head and breast when at rest, {{in the shape of a}} flattened. The palpi, atteched at the base of the labium, form two slender flattened filaments often as long as the labium itself, the two basal joints being very long, with the two apical <b>joints</b> <b>minute,</b> and obliquely affixed near the extremity of the second joint; the maxillary palpi vary in the number of joints from one to six...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} cooling on {{proprioception}} {{of the knee}} has not been studied extensively. In this study, we investigated the movement reproduction (timing and accuracy) aspect of proprioception. Subjects were tested under two conditions: a 20 -minute application of ice and control. Proprioceptive accuracy and timing were measured by passively moving the knee, then comparing the subject's active reproduction of the passive movement. Subjects were blindfolded, then tested in three sectors of the knee's range of motion: 90 ° to 60 °, 60 ° to 30 °, and 30 ° to full extension. Ice application had no apparent effect on the subject's ability to perform accurate movement reproductions in the sectors tested. However, accuracy of the subject's final angle reproduction varied between the sectors as did the total time of the movement. One {{possible explanation for the}} difference between sectors is that different receptors are active at different points in the knee's range of motion.

40|$|Background and purpose: Recent {{findings}} suggest that the noxious gas H(2) S is produced endogenously, and that physiological concentrations of H(2) S are able to modulate pain and inflammation in rodents. This study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of endogenous and exogenous H(2) S to modulate carrageenan-induced synovitis in the rat knee. Experimental approach: Synovitis was induced in Wistar rats by intra-articular injection of carrageenan into the knee <b>joint.</b> Sixty <b>minutes</b> prior to carrageenan injection, the rats were pretreated with indomethacin, an inhibitor of H(2) S formation (dl-propargylglycine) or an H(2) S donor [Lawesson`s reagent (LR) ]. Key results: Injection of carrageenan evoked knee inflammation, pain as characterized by impaired gait, secondary tactile allodynia of the ipsilateral hindpaw, joint swelling, histological changes, inflammatory cell infiltration, increased synovial myeloperoxidase, protein nitrotyrosine residues, inducible NOS (iNOS) activity and NO production. Pretreatment with LR or indomethacin significantly attenuated the pain responses, and all the inflammatory and biochemical changes, except for the increased iNOS activity, NO production and 3 -NT. Propargylglycine pretreatment potentiated synovial iNOS activity (and NO production), and enhanced macrophage infiltration, but had no effect on other inflammatory parameters. Conclusions and implications: Whereas exogenous H(2) S delivered to the knee joint can produce a significant anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effect, locally produced H(2) S exerts little immunomodulatory effect. These data further support the development and use of H(2) S donors as potential alternatives (or complementary therapies) to the available anti-inflammatory compounds used for treatment of joint inflammation or relief of its symptoms.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the usefulness of}} a cognitive behavior modification (CBM) intervention package with mentally retarded students in overcoming learned helplessness and improving learning strategies. It also examined the feasibility of instructing teachers {{in the use of}} such a training program for a classroom setting. A modified single subject design across individuals was employed using two groups of three subjects. Three students from each of two segregated schools for the mentally retarded were selected using a teacher questionnaire and pupil checklist of the most learned helpless students enrolled there. Three additional learned helplessness assessments were conducted on each subject before and after the intervention in order to evaluate the usefulness of the program in alleviating learned helplessness. A classroom environment was created with the three students from each school engaged in three twenty minute work sessions a week with the experimenter and a tutor experimenter (TE) as instructors. Baseline measurements were established on seven targeted behaviors for each subject: task-relevant speech, task-irrelevant speech, speech denoting a positive evaluation of performance, speech denoting a negative evaluation of performance, proportion of time on task, non-verbal positive evaluation of performance and non-verbal negative evaluation of performance. The intervention package combined a variety of CBM techniques such as Meichenbaum's (1977) Stop, Look and Listen approach, role rehearsal and feedback. During the intervention each subject met with his TE twice a week for an individual half-hour session and one <b>joint</b> twenty <b>minute</b> session with all three students, the experimentor and one TE. Five weeks after the end of this experiment one follow up probe was conducted. All baseline, post-intervention and probe sessions were videotaped. The seven targeted behaviors were coded and comparisons of baseline, post intervention, and probe testing were presented in graph form. Results showed a reduction in learned helplessness in all subjects. Improvement was noted in each of the seven targeted behaviors for each of the six subjects. This study indicated that mentally retarded children can be taught to reduce learned helplessness {{with the aid of a}} CBM intervention package. It also showed that CBM is a viable approach in helping mentally retarded students acquire more effective learning strategies.

40|$|Study design : Retrospective, observational, open label. Objective : We {{investigated}} {{the efficacy of}} facet debridement {{for the treatment of}} facet joint pain. Summary of background data : Facet joint disease, often due to degenerative arthritis, is common cause of chronic back pain. In patients that don't respond to conservative measures, nerve ablation may provide significant improvement. Due to the ability of peripheral nerves to regenerate, ablative techniques of the dorsal nerve roots often provide only temporary relief. In theory, ablation of the nerve end plates in the facet joint capsule should prevent reinnervation. Methods : All patients treated with endoscopic facet debridement at our clinic from 2003 - 2007 with at least 3 years follow-up were included in the analysis. Primary outcome measure was percent change in facet-related pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at final follow-up visit. Results : A total of 174 people (77 women, 97 men; mean age 64, range 22 - 89) were included. Location of facet pain was cervical in 45, thoracic in 15, and lumbar in 114 patients. At final follow-up, 77 %, 73 %, and 68 % of patients with cervical, thoracic, or lumbar disease, respectively, showed at least 50 % improvement in pain. Mean operating time per <b>joint</b> was 17 <b>minutes</b> (range, 10 - 42). Mean blood loss was 40 ml (range, 10 - 100). Complications included suture failure in two patients, requiring reclosure of the incision. No infection or nerve damage beyond what was intended occurred. Conclusions : Our results demonstrate a comparable efficacy of endoscopic facet debridement compared to radiofrequency ablation of the dorsal nerve branch, with durable results. Large scale, randomized trials are warranted to further evaluate the relative efficacy of this surgical treatment in patients with facet joint disease. </p...|$|R

In its primary conclusion, the joint committee considers that the evidence available at the present time does not indicate an unacceptable health hazard from microwave emissions within the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) guidelines (IRPA, 1998) and does not consider that the precautionary principle should be invoked at this time. It states that in the event of such evidence becoming available, remedial measures would be put in place. While the Committee states that a comprehensive, up-to-date mobile phone network is essential to continued economic prosperity, it concludes that public information and consultation has not been ideal and that this has given rise to much of the concern around. the issue in Ireland. This has lead to what the committee calls "unnecessary fears and anxiety and false beliefs". It also expressed concern over the application of the planning process around the erection of these masts.

40|$|The DOE-funded {{accelerator}} BNCT {{program at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{has resulted in the}} only operating accelerator-based epithermal neutron beam facility capable of generating significant dose rates in the world. With five separate beamlines and two different epithermal neutron beam assemblies installed, we are currently capable of treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis in less than 15 <b>minutes</b> (knee <b>joints)</b> or 4 <b>minutes</b> (finger <b>joints)</b> or irradiating patients with shallow brain tumors to a healthy tissue dose of 12. 6 Gy in 3. 6 hours. The accelerator, designed by Newton scientific Incorporated, is located in dedicated laboratory space that MIT renovated specifically for this project. The Laboratory for Accelerator Beam Applications consists of an accelerator room, a control room, a shielded radiation vault, and additional laboratory space nearby. In addition to the design, construction and characterization of the tandem electrostatic accelerator, this program also resulted in other significant accomplishments. Assemblies for generating epithermal neutron beams were designed, constructed and experimentally evaluated using mixed-field dosimetry techniques. Strategies for target construction and target cooling were implemented and tested. We demonstrated that the method of submerged jet impingement using water as the coolant is capable of handling power densities of up to 6 x 10 (sup 7) W/m(sup 2) with heat transfer coefficients of 10 (sup 6) W/m(sup 2) -K. Experiments with the liquid metal gallium demonstrated its superiority compared with water with little effect on the neutronic properties of the epithermal beam. Monoenergetic proton beams generated using the accelerator were used to evaluate proton RBE as a function of LET and demonstrated a maximum RBE at approximately 30 - 40 keV/um, a finding consistent with results published by other researchers. We also developed an experimental approach to biological intercomparison of epithermal beams and compared the RBE characteristics of the MIT Reactor M 67 clinical beam, The Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor clinical beam (both of which were used in Phase I/II clinical trials of BNCT) and the MIT LABA BNCS beam. Additional research initiated under this program involved an investigation of the potential of BNCT for the prevention of restenosis and the development of accelerator-based fast neutron brachytherapy.
