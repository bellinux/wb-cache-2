40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo assess {{prescription}} {{renewal and}} switch rates in an elderly population receiving oxybutynin or <b>flavoxate</b> {{for treatment of}} urinary incontinence in Quebec. MethodsSociodemographic, clinical, and drug claim data for patients ⩾ 65 years of age, {{with at least one}} claim for oxybutynin or <b>flavoxate</b> between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997, were randomly extracted from a database maintained by the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ). Rates of renewal of the first drug claim and the number of patients switching from one incontinence drug to the other were determined. In addition, survival curves defining the time until cessation of initial treatment were constructed. ResultsThe oxybutynin (n = 5718) and <b>flavoxate</b> (n = 972) treatment groups were similar in terms of gender (62. 1 % female) and age (mean age 77). For oxybutynin, 56. 8 % of the claims were written by general practitioners and 36. 6 % by urologists compared to 40. 5 % by general practitioners and 51. 4 % by urologists for <b>flavoxate.</b> Only 39. 3 % of the oxybutynin patients renewed their first claims, compared to 36. 6 % of the <b>flavoxate</b> group. Switch rates were higher for <b>flavoxate</b> patients with {{more than twice as many}} patients switching from this drug to oxybutynin than vice versa. Survival curves indicated that there was only an 11. 4 % probability of a patient taking oxybutynin for 6 months compared to 5. 7 % for <b>flavoxate</b> patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} "urgency with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia". It is a common condition with significant economic {{and quality of life}} implications. While the condition's pathophysiology remains to be fully elucidated, pharmacotherapy is the main treatment option. Despite uncertainty as to drug treatment of choice, anticholinergics are increasingly being used in primary and secondary care settings. This review compares anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder syndromes. OBJECTIVES: To compare anticholinergic drugs with other types or classes of drugs for treating overactive bladder symptoms. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 20 December 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles. No language or other limits were imposed. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with other drugs for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms. At least one arm of the study used an anticholinergic drug and at least one other arm used a non-anticholinergic drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed the identified studies for eligibility and methodological quality and independently extracted data from the included studies. Data analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 4. 2. 8). MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen trials were included in the review. There were eight crossover trials and five parallel group studies. For the comparisons between anticholinergic drugs with tricyclic antidepressants, alpha adrenergic agonists, afferent nerve inhibitors, and calcium channel blocker a single trial was identified for each. Ten trials compared <b>flavoxate</b> with anticholinergics. There was no evidence of a difference in cure rates between anticholinergics and <b>flavoxate.</b> Adverse effects were more frequent in anticholinergic groups versus <b>flavoxate</b> groups (RR 2. 28 95 % CI 1. 45 to 3. 56). There was no strong evidence to favour either anticholinergic drugs or the comparators. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Many of the drugs considered in trials in this review are no longer used in clinical practice (and this includes the most commonly tested - <b>flavoxate).</b> There is inadequate no evidence as to whether any of the available is better or worse than anticholinergic medications. Larger randomised controlled trials in clinical settings are required to further establish the role of these other medications in the management of overactive bladder syndrome...|$|E

Then, the {{cells were cultured in}} RPMI culture medium containing 214 nM staurosporine for induction of neurite outgrowth. The percentage of Cell cytotoxicity and apoptotic index was assessed. Total neurite length (TNL) and fraction of cell differentiation were assessed. After 24 h, the percentage of cell cytotoxicity were increased in treatments 1, 2 and 4 compared with control (p < 0. 05). After 6 h, apoptotic index was similar between all treatments. After 12 h, apoptotic index were increased in treatment 4 compared with control (p < 0. 05). After 24 h, apoptotic index were increased in treatments 1, 2 and 4 compared with control (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Overactive bladder (OAB) is {{a medical}} {{syndrome}} defined by symptoms of urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence (any involuntary loss of urine), usually with frequency and nocturia. Although anticholinergic agents have been the first-line treatment for OAB for many years, the efficacious pharmacologic management of this condition has been compromised by concerns regarding tolerability. <b>Flavoxate</b> was the first anticholinergic and antispasmodic agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat symptoms of OAB but is not routinely used today since newer agents are more effective. The more recent drugs, oxybutynin and tolterodine, have appeared to be equally efficacious in treating the symptoms of OAB in clinical trials; however, tolterodine {{has proven to be}} better tolerated with fewer adverse effects. In 2004, the FDA approved the three newest agents for the class: darifenacin, solifenacin, and trospium. Compared with oxybutynin and tolterodine, these agents have a more favorable side effect profile, which can enhance tolerability and patient compliance. Side effects are reduced {{in part because of the}} drugs' greater tissue selectivity for inhibiting the bladder muscle contraction over other anticholinergic receptors in the body.

40|$|Background: Majority of Indian {{population}} {{is dependent on}} general practitioners (GPs) for medical services at primary care level in India. They are most preferred and considered to be first contact person for medical services at primary care level. But advances in medical science has put more emphasis on specialist culture and average Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) graduates who are working as general physician are gradually feeling themselves less competent because they are less exposed to latest advances in treatment of diseases.

It has started a decentralized 2 -year family medicine distance diploma course (Postgraduate Diploma in Family Medicine (PGDFM)) now accredited by Dr. MGR Medical University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, that trains the GPs to become family medicine specialist. Materials and Methods: As component of PGDFM course, this study was conducted to provide better understanding of prevalent ailments and common treatment provided by the GPs in the community at present giving key insight of current practice in rural area by a registered family medicine practitioner. Results: As part of study, among 500 patients evaluated, three most common diagnosis were upper respiratory infections (URIs; 18 %), acute gastroenteritis including water-borne diseases (15. 8 %), and anemia (10. 4 %). Treatment given to these patients comprised of mostly of antipyretic, analgesic, and antimicrobial agents. Most common drug prescribed was paracetamol for fever.

Secondary endpoints included 12 -mo persistence rates and adherence (assessed using medication possession ratio, MPR). Cox proportional-hazards regression models and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors were used to compare cohorts. Analyses were repeated after 1 : 1 matching. Results and limitations: The study population included 21. 996 eligible patients. In the unmatched analysis, the median time-to-discontinuation was significantly longer for mirabegron (169 d, interquartile range [IQR] 41 -not reached) compared to tolterodine ER (56 d, IQR 28 - 254; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval 1. 41 - 1. 71; p <. 0. 0001) and other antimuscarinics (range 30 - 78 d; adjusted HR range 1. 24 - 2. 26, p <. 0. 0001 for all comparisons). The 12 -mo persistence rates and MPR were also significantly greater with mirabegron than with all the antimuscarinics. Limitations include the retrospective design, use of prescription records to estimate outcomes, and inability to capture reasons for discontinuation. Conclusions: Persistence and adherence were statistically significantly greater with mirabegron than with tolterodine ER and other antimuscarinics prescribed for OAB in the UK. Patient summary: This study assessed persistence and adherence (or compliance) with medications prescribed for OAB in a large UK population. We found that patients prescribed mirabegron remained on treatment for longer and showed greater adherence than those prescribed traditional antimuscarinics. For chronic conditions such as overactive bladder, long-term adherence is important to maintain treatment benefit. Persistence with antimuscarinics is a recognised challenge. This analysis of a UK primary care database demonstrates that persistence and adherence are significantly greater with mirabegron versus antimuscarinics...|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with recurrent {{urinary tract infection}} or urinary incontinence were diagnosed as reflex neurogenic bladder including uninhibited neurogenic bladder or unstable bladder {{by a series of}} tests including urological routine tests, roentgenography (mainly, voiding cysto-urethrography), urodynamic and electrophysiologic examinations, urethral pressure profile, and endoscopic examinations, and by EEG and myelography for some cases. Some of them were treated with timepidium bromide, an anti-cholinergic agent, and the effects were evaluated by urodynamic examinations before and after the treatment. Other patients were subcutaneously injected with bethanecol chloride and 30 minutes later subjected to urodynamic examinations. Then, they were intramuscularly injected with timepidium bromide, and again subjected to urodynamic examination 30 minutes later. The latter trial was an attempt to make vesical and urethral smooth muscles more unstable and in these conditions to probe the efficacy of timepidium more clearly. The urodynamic examinations used in this series were Lewis' cystometrogram for the bladder filling phase and the voiding urodynamic examination (VUD) for the voiding phase with a 6 channel polygraph that simultaneously measured the vesical, urethral and intra-abdominal pressures, tonus and E M G of the anal sphincter, and urinary flow rate. The subjects studied consisted of 6 males and 24 females from the age 6 to 65 (22 children and 8 adults), and of 13 cases of unstable bladder and 17 cases of uninhibited neurogenic bladder. Timepidium bromide was very effective in 63 %, and only moderately effective in 20 % of the treated patients. The effects of the drug were evaluated on the three voiding parameters, i. e. the bladder volumes at the first desire to void, maximal desire to void and maximal vesical voiding pressure before and after administration of the drug, and analyzed by Student "t" test to give the following results; the first two parameters were greater with P P> 0. 001 after than before the treatment. This indicates that the vesical capacity increased and the voiding pressure decreased after the treatment with timepidium with high degrees of statistical significance. In other words, the lowered vesical capacity and the hypertonic condition in uninhibited neurogenic bladder were alleviated by the treatment with timepidium. Comparison of the urodynamic patterns on the 6 channel polygraph between pre- and post-administration measurements revealed a decrease or complete disappearance of the involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase after the drug treatment. It was worthy of note that the secondary spastic condition of the pelvic floor musculature due to the involuntary contractions of the detrusor decreased or nearly disappeared after the treatment. This latter aspect seemed to be the {{one of the most important}} actions in the mechanism for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection and enuresis. The urodynamic patterns during the voiding phase indicated that the treatment with timepidium diminished or eliminated the fluctuations of the vesical and the urethral pressures observed before and after the voiding phase. Improvement of dyssynergia between detrusor and external urethral sphincter was not clearly observed. In conclusion, the treatment with anti-cholinergic agents such as timepidium should constitute the standard therapy for uninhibited neurogenic bladder and unstable bladder, and such an agent may be indicated in combination with other drugs according to symptoms. For example, the use of timepidium with tolperisone hydrochloride or diazepam should be taken into consideration when the spasm of the pelvic floor musculature appears. Large doses of an anti-cholinergic agent may be necessary for the uninhibited neurogenic bladder as a sequel of cerebral infantile paralysis or other brain diseases. In these cases, combined medication with <b>flavoxate</b> or imipramine should be warranted...|$|E
