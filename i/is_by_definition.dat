5|$|Because an ASIC <b>is</b> (<b>by</b> <b>definition)</b> {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for molecular dynamics simulation.|$|E
5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a much more powerful, coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E

25|$|Where {{legislation}} imposes cobhead's {{liability for}} an omission, then {{the issue is}} straightforward and the general dislike for omissions liability is displaced. For example, failing to provide a specimen of breath at the roadside <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> a criminal omission.|$|E
25|$|Salinity should {{therefore}} be between 28 and 35 ppt, with the higher values being beneficial in advanced reef systems. Because salinity <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> directly related to specific gravity, both can be tested with an inexpensive hydrometer or refractometer.|$|E
25|$|Because {{these first}} two FAT entries store special values, {{there are no}} data {{clusters}} 0 or 1. The first data cluster (after the root directory if FAT12/FAT16) is cluster 2, and cluster 2 <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> the first cluster in the data area.|$|E

25|$|Since it <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> {{impossible}} to convey qualia verbally, {{it is also}} {{impossible to}} demonstrate them directly in an argument; so a more tangential approach is needed. Arguments for qualia generally {{come in the form}} of thought experiments designed to lead one to the conclusion that qualia exist.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> {{the right}} of women to vote. This was {{the goal of the}} suffragists in the United States and the suffragettes in Great Britain. Short-lived suffrage equity was drafted into provisions of the State of New Jersey's first, 1776 Constitution, which extended the Right to Vote to unwed female landholders & black land owners.|$|E
25|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} of stocks and bonds to investors <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> done in the primary market and subsequent trading {{is done in the}} secondary market. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in stock markets are driven by various factors that, as in all free markets, affect the price of stocks (see stock valuation).|$|E

25|$|Cardinal numbers can {{be defined}} as follows. Define two sets to have the same size by: there exists a {{bijection}} between the two sets (a one-to-one correspondence between the elements). Then a cardinal number <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> a class consisting of all sets of the same size. To have the same size is an equivalence relation, and the cardinal numbers are the equivalence classes.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its {{assertion that the}} economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.|$|E
25|$|A {{manifestation of}} the Sacred in profane space <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> an example of {{something}} breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must be {{a point at which}} there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a Cosmic Tree or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the underworld.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{analytical}} index is usually hard to evaluate directly, {{it is at}} least obviously an integer. The topological index <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> a rational number, but it is usually not at all obvious from the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.|$|E
25|$|The World Wide Web Consortium {{also has}} an XML Binary Characterization Working Group doing {{preliminary}} research into use cases and properties for a binary encoding of XML Information Set. The working group is not chartered to produce any official standards. Since XML <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> text-based, ITU-T and ISO are using the name Fast Infoset for their own binary infoset to avoid confusion (see ITU-T Rec. X.891 and ISO/IEC 24824-1).|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{life is the}} {{simulation}} of any aspect of life, as through computers, robotics, or biochemistry. The study of artificial life imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena. Scientists study the logic of living systems by creating artificial environments—seeking to understand the complex information processing that defines such systems. While life <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> alive, artificial life is generally referred to as data confined to a digital environment and existence.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> an arithmetic mean. It {{can also}} be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed cohort (all people born in year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.|$|E
25|$|Breaths are {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition,</b> assisted.|$|E
50|$|The term {{accounting}} identity {{may be used}} to distinguish between propositions that are theories (which {{may or may not be}} true, or relationships that may or may not always hold) and statements that <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> true. Despite the fact that the statements <b>are</b> <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> true, the underlying figures as measured or estimated may not add up due to measurement error, particularly for certain identities in macroeconomics.|$|R
