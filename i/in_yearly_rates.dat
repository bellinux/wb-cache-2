40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the long-term impact of the Bloor Street Viaduct suicide barrier on rates of suicide in Toronto and whether media reporting had any impact on suicide rates. DESIGN: Natural experiment. SETTING: City of Toronto, Canada; records at the chief coroner's office of Ontario 1993 - 2003 (11 years before the barrier) and 2004 - 2014 (11 years after the barrier). PARTICIPANTS: 5403 people who died by suicide {{in the city of}} Toronto. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes <b>in</b> <b>yearly</b> <b>rates</b> of suicide by jumping at Bloor Street Viaduct, other bridges including nearest comparison bridge and walking distance bridges, and buildings, and by other means. RESULTS: Suicide rates at the Bloor Street Viaduct declined from 9. 0 deaths/year before the barrier to 0. 1 deaths/year after the barrier (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0. 005, 95 %[*]CI 0. 0005 to 0. 19, p= 0. 002). Suicide deaths from bridges in Toronto also declined significantly (IRR 0. 53, 95 %[*]CI 0. 40 to 0. 71, p< 0. 0001). Media reports about suicide at the Bloor Street Viaduct were associated with an increase in suicide-by-jumping from bridges the following year. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that, over the long term, suicide-by-jumping declined in Toronto after the barrier with no associated increase in suicide by other means. That is, the barrier appears to have had its intended impact at preventing suicide despite a short-term rise in deaths at other bridges that was at least partially influenced by a media effect. Research examining barriers at other locations should interpret short-term results with caution. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

One {{of the causes}} may be that Semmelweis used different sources. He points out several times that actual mortality rates were higher than reported ones, because during childbed fever epidemics, the maternity ward was overwhelmed with dying women, who were then transferred to the general hospital, and therefore not registered at the maternity ward, when dying. Some women were also released from the maternity ward, either healthy or not so healthy, only to be readmitted to the general hospital when symptoms appeared or worsened.

30|$|In parallel, another {{revolution}} is taking place, at a less mediatised rate {{but no less}} certainly than the AI one, {{and it has to}} do with quantification. Quantification in radiology starts with simple anatomical precision, and the well-known Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours criteria [2] used for assessment of treatment response in cancer are based on the premise that measurement of size can be made reproducibly over time, even if the patient is not scanned by the same machine functioning on the same software level. While these criteria are rather rough and simple, the issue of reproducibility and anatomical precision becomes already more challenging when MRI (or less frequently CT) is used to assess the slow reduction in grey matter taking place in dementia over time [3]. Precision becomes particularly crucial now that the new diagnostic criteria for dementia are based on an increase <b>in</b> the <b>yearly</b> <b>rate</b> of atrophy, at typically 2 % for Alzheimer’s patients, with respect to the general population (0.5 % per annum from the age of 40  years) [4, 5].

Although overseas development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health has increased, funding for this sector accounted for only 31 % of all development assistance for health in 2007.

40|$|The {{processes}} controlling tufa deposition {{along the}} River Mesa (NE Spain) were studied from April 2003 to September 2009, based on six-monthly monitoring {{of physical and}} chemical parameters of the river water and sedimentological characteristics, including deposition rates on tablets. With a mean annual discharge around 1. 5 m 3 /s, the sedimentation rate (mean 2 mm/yr) recorded important spatial, seasonal and interannual variations. The river waters are of the calcium bicarbonate type. In this study, three distinct river stretches were distinguished based on the steady groundwater inputs, some of low-thermal nature. Groundwater discharges controlled the water chemical composition, and some sedimentation features too. At each stretch, an increase in pCO 2 and conductivity was measured around the spring sites. Decreasing trends in conductivity or alkalinity with high enough saturation values with respect to calcite were only clearly observed in the intermediate stretch, which had higher tufa deposition rates than the other two. Tufa deposition rates were higher in cool (autumn+winter) than in warm (spring+summer) periods. In some low-rainfall warm periods, tufa deposition was inhibited or limited due to the low flow –mainly from groundwater inputs– and to the dryness of some river sites, which indeed favoured erosion during flooding. A decrease <b>in</b> <b>yearly</b> deposition <b>rates</b> from April 2006 onwards paralleled an important reduction in the river discharge.

This study evaluates survival, comorbidities and joint damage in the original COBRA trial cohort. METHODS: In the COBRA trial, 155 early RA patients were treated with sulfasalazine monotherapy (SSZ-group) or a combination of step-down prednisolone, methotrexate and sulfasalazine (COBRA-group). The current 11 -year follow-up study of the COBRA trial invited all original patients and performed protocollized scrutiny of clinical records, questionnaires, physical examination, laboratory and imaging tests. RESULTS: 152 out of 155 patients yielded at least partial data. After mean 11 years follow-up, 18 (12 %) patients had died, 6 COBRA patients and 12 SSZ patients, hazard ratio 0. 57 (95 %CI: 0. 21 - 1. 52). Treatment for hypertension was significantly more prevalent in the COBRA-group (P= 0. 02) with similar trends for diabetes and cataract. Conversely, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and infection showed a trend in favour of COBRA. Other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and fractures appeared in similar frequency. Radiographic findings suggest as a minimum sustained benefit for COBRA therapy, i. e. difference in joint damage but similar subsequent progression rates after 5 years.

40|$|Events in primate {{evolution}} {{are often}} dated by assuming a constant rate of substitution per unit time, but {{the validity of}} this assumption remains unclear. Among mammals, {{it is well known}} that there exists substantial variation <b>in</b> <b>yearly</b> substitution <b>rates.</b> Such variation is to be expected from differences in life history traits, suggesting it should also be found among primates. Motivated by these considerations, we analyze whole genomes from 10 primate species, including Old World Monkeys (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs), and apes, focusing on putatively neutral autosomal sites and controlling for possible effects of biased gene conversion and methylation at CpG sites. We find that substitution rates are up to 64 % higher in lineages leading from the hominoid–NWM ancestor to NWMs than to apes. Within apes, rates are ∼ 2 % higher in chimpanzees and ∼ 7 % higher in the gorilla than in humans. Substitution types subject to biased gene conversion show no more variation among species than those not subject to it. Not all mutation types behave similarly, however; in particular, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more clocklike behavior than do other types, presumably because of their nonreplicative origin. Thus, not only the total rate, but also the mutational spectrum, varies among primates. This finding suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated using CpG transitions. Taking this approach, we estimate the human and chimpanzee divergence time is 12. 1 million years,​ and the human and gorilla divergence time is 15. 1 million years​. United States.

The trend {{over the last five}} decades has been inexorably toward faster and faster turnover. In contrast to today's greater than 100 % annual turnover, <b>in</b> 1960 the <b>yearly</b> <b>rate</b> was just 12 %. That means that 45 years ago the average share of an NYSE-listed stock was held more than eight years! To be sure, the current 11 -month holding period for the typical stock is an average. That means that not all individual investors turn their portfolios over this often. Band's rhetorical question notwithstanding, long-term investors still do exist. But Band is right to point out that these long-term investors are increasingly {{the exception rather than the}} rule. They are being replaced by hyperactive traders who, to use a line that is popular on Wall Street, consider the long term to last from just lunch to dinner. No doubt there are many contributing causes of this faster and faster turnover. Part of the responsibility must be borne b...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiological}} profile and trends of road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Peru {{have not been}} well-defined, though this is a necessary step to address this significant public health problem in Peru. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine trends of incidence, mortality, and fatality of RTIs in Peru during 1973 - 2008, as well as their relationship to population trends such as economic growth. Secondary aggregated databases were used to estimate incidence, mortality and fatality rate ratios (IRRs) of RTIs. These estimates were standardized to age groups and sex of the 2008 Peruvian population. Negative binomial regression and cubic spline curves were used for multivariable analysis. During the 35 -year period there were 952, 668 road traffic victims, injured or killed. The adjusted yearly incidence of RTIs increased by 3. 59 (95 % CI 2. 43 - 5. 31) on average. We did not observe any significant trends <b>in</b> the <b>yearly</b> mortality <b>rate.</b> The total adjusted <b>yearly</b> fatality <b>rate</b> decreased by 0. 26 (95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 43), while among adults the fatality rate increased by 1. 25 (95 % CI 1. 09 - 1. 43). Models fitted with splines suggest that the incidence follows a bimodal curve and closely followed trends in the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The significant increasing incidence of RTIs in Peru affirms their growing threat to public health. A substantial improvement of information systems for RTIs is needed to create a more accurate epidemiologic profile of RTIs in Peru. This approach can be of use in other similar low and middle-income settings to inform about the local challenges posed by RTIs...|$|R
