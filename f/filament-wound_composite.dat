Finite element {{analysis was used}} to study three conditions of pipe riser – uncorroded, corroded and corroded and repaired with designated laminate orientation of carbon/epoxy or E-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced composite. The behaviour of the pipe riser (grade API 5 L X 60 steel) was studied using Ramberg–Osgood model. Two composites laminate systems, a pre-cured prepreg (grade AS 4 3501 - 6 carbon/epoxy) and a wet-layup <b>filament-wounded</b> <b>composite</b> (grade Gevetex LY 556 /HT 917 /DY 063 E-glass/epoxy), were characterised.

The limiting design factor of the composite repair system was due to excessive tensile strain experienced in a bent riser while the compressive stress caused by reversing the bending load occurred well within the linear-elastic region. With respect to the types of composite repair system, carbon fibre displayed a much better strength rehabilita-tion over glass fibre.

40|$|A {{filament-wound}} spinning composite disk is characterised by the mosaic-patterned {{configuration of}} the layers produced during a filament-winding process. In this structure, each helically wound layer consists of curved triangular-shaped units alternating in the radial and circumferential directions. The mosaic-patterned configuration is not normally considered in the general stress analysis procedures based on the conventional modelling of laminated composite structures, including those available in FEA packages. However, the filament-winding mosaic pattern of the composite layer could significantly affect the stress fields developed due to rotational loading. Therefore, a methodology for the FE modelling {{and analysis of the}} filament-wound disk taking into account this effect is developed and structural analyses are performed using ANSYS, with different types of filament-winding mosaic patterns incorporated. Also, the disk is modelled and analysed using a conventional method and the differences in predicted stress values from both techniques are demonstrated through distributions of various stresses. The modelling governed by the first order shear deformation theory is performed using the SHELL 281 element. Firstly, using a conventional approach, the <b>filament-wound</b> <b>composite</b> disk is modelled as a laminated circular plate composed of different numbers of plies in which interlacing of plies due to filament-winding is not considered. Alternatively, three designs composed of 4, 8 and 14 plies are chosen to model the mosaic-patterned structure and to demonstrate changes in the stress levels in different layers and the extent of the influence of ply interlacing. Each design is associated with three types of mosaic-patterned configurations, namely 4, 6 and 8 mosaic units around the circumference of the disk. The disk is rotated at a constant angular velocity with the boundary conditions to prevent in-plane rigid body motions in both the radial and circumferential directions and also out-of-plane rigid body motion in the axial direction. As observed, the stress levels in the thin <b>filament-wound</b> <b>composite</b> flywheel disk could be underestimated in case of a structural analysis using the conventional mechanics of laminated structures. The layers of the <b>filament-wound</b> <b>composite</b> flywheel disk are reinforced with radially varying fibre trajectories that result in continuous changes in fibre orientation angles which generate stiffness variations and composite laminates with such stiffness variations are called variable-stiffness laminates. Thus, varying fibre trajectories should be modelled accurately to incorporate the actual stiffness variations for FEA of variable-stiffness composite structures. Therefore, a modelling approach is developed that would take into account the continuously varying fibre orientation angles derived from the predefined changing fibre trajectories. FE modelling of variable-stiffness laminates is performed using the proposed method and corresponding results obtained from various analyses are reported. Based on the results obtained from the numerical analyses of the filament-wound flywheel disk, various design aspects are assessed in terms of the dimensions and energy storage capacity of the disk. Parametric and comparative analyses of various disks are performed using different performance-controlling factors...|$|E
40|$|Safe {{installation}} {{and operation of}} lightweight composite hydrogen storage cylinders are of primary concern. Typically, the inner liner of the cylinder is made with a high molecular weight polymer or aluminum {{that serves as a}} hydrogen gas permeation barrier. A <b>filament-wound,</b> carbon/epoxy <b>composite</b> laminate placed over the liner provides the desired pressure load bearing capacity. In many current designs, a glass/epoxy layer or other material is placed over the carbon/epoxy laminate to provide impact and damage resistance. These cylinders also have pressure/thermal relief devices that are activated in case of an emergency. The difficulty in accurately analyzing the behavior of a filament wound composite storage cylinder derives form the continually varying orientation of the fibers. Most of the analysis reported in filament wound composite cylinders is based on simplifying assumptions and does not account for complexities like thermo-mechanical behavior and highly orthotropic nature of the material. In the present work, a comprehensive finite element simulation tool for the design of hydrogen storage cylinder system is developed.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} {{acoustic}} emission (AE) behavior of impact-damaged, spherical, composite test specimens subjected to thermal cycling and biaxial mechanical loading are presented. Seven Kevlar{reg_sign}-epoxy, <b>filament-wound,</b> spherical <b>composite</b> test specimens were subjected to different levels of impact damage. The seven specimens were a subset of a group of 77 specimens made with simulated fabrication-induced flaws. The specimens were subjected to two or three cycles of elevated temperature and then hydraulically pressurized to failure. The pressurization regime consisted of two cycles to different intermediate levels with a hold at each peak pressure level; a final pressurization to failure followed. The thermal and pressurization cycles were carefully designed to stimulate AE production under defined conditions. Both impacted and nonimpacted specimens produced thermo-AE (the term given to emission stimulated by thermal loading), but impacted specimens produced significantly more. Thermo-AE was produced primarily by damaged composite material. Damaged material produced emission as a function of both rising and falling temperature, but the effect was not repeatable. More seriously damaged specimens produced very large quantities of emission. Emission recorded during the static portion of the hydraulic loading cycles varied with load, time, and degree of damage. Static load AE behavior was quantified using a newly developed concept, the event-rate moment, and various correlations with residual strength were attempted. Correlations between residual strength, long-duration events, and even-rate moments were developed with varying degrees of success...|$|R
