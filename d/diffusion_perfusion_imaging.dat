This study investigates the effectiveness of reverse gradient susceptibility correction methods on spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GE) EPI. In addition, the effects of varying bandwidth, SENSE factor and slice thickness on the corrected images were measured. Undistorted, anatomically accurate images are necessary in relating EPI images to anatomical MRI scans. This is particularly important for <b>diffusion</b> weighted <b>imaging,</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>imaging</b> and fMRI. Due to the ever-increasing need for better temporal resolution with existing hardware, effective artefact correction in post-processing is necessary, as is appropriate sequence optimisation. This investigation was accomplished using normalised mutual information to compare the images pre and post correction to an anatomical image {{as a measure of}} anatomical accuracy. It was found that the correction of geometric distortions is equally effective in GE-EPI and SE-EPI, and that geometric correction can reduce the impact of the aforementioned scan parameters on the anatomical accuracy of the images. Three correction methods were compared in this investigation; FSL TOPUP, EPI-EPIC and ACID HySCO. It was found that, in most situations, the EPIC susceptibility correction tool was the most effective tool at correcting geometric distortions without the generation of new artefacts. Susceptibility artefact corrections were also successfully conducted on 7 T contrast enhanced single shot EPI images of a prostate tumour xenograft (nude mouse).

Using <b>diffusion</b> and <b>perfusion</b> <b>imaging,</b> we compared the spatiotemporal evolution of ischemia in Sprague Dawley rats after permanent suture MCAO (sMCAO; n= 8) and embolic MCAO (eMCAO; n= 8). METHODS: Serial measurements of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were performed up to 180 minutes after MCAO. ADC and CBF values within 5 different brain regions were analyzed. ADC and CBF lesion volumes were calculated by using previously established viability thresholds and correlated with infarct volume defined by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining 24 hours after MCAO.

The ADC lesion volume did not differ between models at any time point. A diffusion/perfusion mismatch was present significantly longer in eMCAO animals (P 3 Ì†c 0. 05), and these rats demonstrated larger absolute mismatch volumes that were statistically significant at 30, 60, and 90 minutes (P 3 Ì†c 0. 05).

Male Sprague-Dawley rats {{were randomly assigned to}} pMCAO produced with either 4 - 0 silicone coated (n= 8), or 3 - 0 uncoated monofilaments (n= 8). Serial determination of quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were performed up to 3 h after pMCAO. Lesion volumes were calculated by using previously validated thresholds and correlated with infarct volume corrected for edema defined by 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 h after MCAO. The ADC/CBF-defined mismatch volume in the 4 - 0 coated suture model was present significantly longer (up to 120 min) compared to the uncoated 3 - 0 suture model (30 min). The TTC-derived infarct volume was significantly larger in the coated model (290. 3 +/- 32. 8 mm(3)) relative to the uncoated model (252. 3 +/- 34. 6 mm(3)).

40|$|In {{a patient}} with an acute ischemic stroke (AIS), {{multimodal}} imaging can not only rapidly provide information about ves-sel patency status but also provide information about infarct core and tissue at risk (the ischemic penumbra).

More specifically, contradictory results {{have been reported in the}} literature regarding whether the infarct core, or the ischemic penumbra, matters most in the prediction of outcome. Two perfusion computed tomography (PCT) -based studies demonstrated that the volume of the infarct core was a more significant determinant of clinical outcome compared with the penumbra or total perfusion deficit. 1, 2 Another study using MRI in patients with an AIS treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator showed that that clinical outcome was predicted by pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volume, but not by perfusion-weighted imaging lesion vol-ume. 3 A pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging lesion vol-ume superior to 70 mL has been proposed as a threshold to predict poor functional outcome. 4 On the contrary, the recent <b>diffusion</b> and <b>perfusion</b> <b>imaging</b> evaluation for understanding stroke evolution (DEFUSE) 2 trial demonstrated patients with a target mismatch profile, hallmarking penumbra, and reperfusion to have a smaller infarct growth and a more favorable clinical outcome.

Quantitative diffusion- (DWI), perfusion- (PWI), T(2) -weighted (T(2) WI), and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) were performed before, during, and up to 1 day after 20 -mins transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO; n= 6) or sham operation (n= 6) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Viability thresholds were employed to calculate <b>diffusion,</b> <b>perfusion,</b> and T(2) lesion volumes. Region of interest analysis was used to evaluate structural and functional MR signal changes within the sensorimotor network, which were then related to corresponding behavioral measures. Post-mortem 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed 24 h after ischemia. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion produced lesions on DWI and PWI, which fully recovered by 30 mins after reperfusion. Ipsilesional fMRI responses to hypercapnia and forepaw stimulation were significantly impaired after ischemia and did not fully normalize until 3 and 24 h after tMCAO, respectively. No abnormalities were observed on imaging or TTC at 24 h despite significant behavioral dysfunctions including contralesional forelimb impairment and ipsilesional neglect. No MRI, behavioral, or TTC anomalies were observed in sham-operated rats. There were no significant correlations between MRI parameters, behavior, and TTC in either group. Together, these results suggest that normal findings on <b>diffusion,</b> <b>perfusion,</b> and T(2) <b>imaging</b> shortly after transient ischemia may not indicate normal tissue status as indicated by fMRI and behavior, which may help explain the persistence of neurologic deficits in patients with normal conventional MRI after cerebral ischemia...|$|R

ResultsThe overall results based on differentiation of typical from atypical and malignant meningiomas by advanced MRI techniques. Twenty four patients had typical meningioma and 6 patients had atypical and malignant Meningiomas by advanced MRI techniques. ConclusionAppearance of meningiomas on DWIs and the calculation of ADC values could be correlated with their histopathological grading. On MRS, alanine was not found to be increased in all meningiomas, so MRS cannot reliably differentiate typical intracranial meningomas from atypical meningiomas...|$|R
40|$|Objective: There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over whether diffusion-perfusion mismatch provides a biomarker for the ischemic penumbra. Regions of the diffusion-perfusion mismatch {{that do not}} progress to infarct {{in the absence of}} reperfusion are considered to represent benign oligemia. However, at least in some cases (particularly large vessel stenosis), some of this hypoperfused tissue may remain dysfunctional for a prolonged period without progressing to infarct and may recover function if eventually reperfused. We hypothesized that patients with persistent diffusion-perfusion mismatch using a hypoperfusion threshold of 4 - 5. 9 seconds delay on time-to-peak maps at least sometimes have persistent cognitive deficits relative to those who show some reperfusion. Methods: We tested this hypothesis in 38 patients with acute ischemic stroke who had simple cognitive tests and MRI with <b>diffusion</b> and <b>perfusion</b> <b>imaging</b> within 24 hours of onset and again within 10 days, most of whom had large vessel stenosis. Results: When we evaluated all patients or only patients who did not have infarct growth, persistent hypoperfusion was associated with a lack of cognitive improvement compared with those who had reperfused (p< 0. 001). Initial volume of hypoperfusion did not correlate with the later infarct volume (progression to infarct), but change in volume of hypoperfusion correlated with change in cognitive performance (p= 0. 0001). Multivariable regression showed that the change in volume of hypoperfused tissue of 4 - 5. 9 sec delay (p= 0. 002), and change in volume of ischemic tissue on DWI (p= 0. 02) were independently associated with change in cognitive function. Conclusion: Our results provide additional evevidence that non-infarcted tissue with a TTP delay of 4 - 5. 9 sec may be associated with persistent deficits, even if it does not always result in imminent progression to infarct. This tissue may represent the occasional opportunity to intervene to improve function even days after onset...|$|R
