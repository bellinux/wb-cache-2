When a potentially explosive gas-air-mixture or gas-dust-mixture occurs, the actuator must not act as ignition source.

In this paper, an uphole monitor for MWD is developed to process and display downhole measure data. Firstly, an explosion-proof computer is developed, {{which can be used}} in explosive gas atmosphere. The <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> and intrinsic safe type of protection have been employed {{to meet the needs of}} explosion-proof and communication with measure unit. A Windows-based software is subsequently developed to show the measure result and generate the in-seam drilling trajectory. The uphole monitor has been integrated into directional drilling system and demonstrated by the application in China’s coalmines...|$|E
40|$|Oaky Creek Coal Mine uses Jiffy Drive Conveyors {{to extend}} the {{production}} and development conveyor systems underground temporarily whilst waiting for permanent conveyor systems to be manufactured. The existing Jiffy Drive starters are enclosed in a <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> that conformed to AS 3800 which was needed when located in ERZ (Explosive Risk Zone) designated areas. Additionally an Austdac control panel had to be mounted separately to the starting panel in a NERZ (Non Explosive Risk Zone) as it was not located in a <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Due their age and changes in mining technology Oaky Creek Coal {{decided it was time}} to overhaul one of their Jiffy Drive Conveyor starting panels named JD 21 into an IP 56, 316 stainless steel enclosure that also incorporated the Austdac control system. Because of the high standard of work and vast industry experience Comlek was chosen to overhaul the design, manufacture and factory acceptance test (FAT) JD 21. With JD 21 in this configuration it will result a modern, reliable product that does not require constant maintenance to ensure that it conforms to the flameproof standard. The main objective for the project is to design a new enclosure for JD 21 that segregates the incoming mains circuit breaker and the control system out of 316 stainless steel. As a part of the new design JD 21 will make use of a PLC that will reduce the number of components required in the control circuit. It will be programmed to work with a Human Machine Interface (HMI) panel view, which will reduce the amount of indication and push button switches needed. There will be an extra cubicle added to the enclosure that will house and Austdac signal generator panel that will allow dupline signal transmission and receiving from field instruments located on the conveyor itself. Upon completion of the project Comlek will handover one fully operational, fully factory acceptance tested (FAT) Jiffy Drive Starter with designation and signage to suit JD 21. Oaky Creek Coal will receive a dossier that includes a user manual and all relevant drawings and schematics of JD 21...|$|E
40|$|Gas explosions {{are a great}} hazard in the {{industry}} where flammable substances are handled. Engines, switches and other electrical equipment can act like ignition sources where an explosive atmosphere is present. Possible ignition sources are placed in <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosures</b> which are designed to withstand an internal explosion and prevent transmission of hot combustion products to ignite an explosive outer atmosphere. All <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosures</b> have {{to fulfill the requirements}} given by the international standard. The current international standard (IEC 2011) require that the maximal average roughness (Ra) of a flame gap surface is <- 6. 3 my m. Any damaged flame gap must be brought back to its original state. The current standard (IEC) gives no technical argument to justify the requirements of an average roughness <- 6. 3 my m. Previous experimental work (Grov 2010; Opsvik 2010; Solheim 2010) has shown that the gap efficiency has in fact improved when applying rust and mechanical damage to the flame gap surfaces so that the average roughness is greater than 6. 3 my m. In those experiments, propane has been used as the test gas. The purpose of the present experimental work is to investigate what effect rust and mechanical damage have on the efficiency of the flame gap to prevent a re-ignition of an explosive ethylene/air mixture. Ethylene is a highly reactive gas. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width which prevents transmission of an internal explosion to the external atmosphere. The MESG is usually used to compare different gases. In the present investigation the MESG is used as parameter to compare how different damages affect the MESG value compared to an undamaged flame gap. If the MESG increases it means that gap efficiency increases, and if the MESG decreases the gap efficiency decreases. All of the experiments in the present work were performed in the Plane Rectangular Slit Apparatus with ethylene as the test gas. Flame gaps were explosion tested before and after rusting. The results showed a {{decrease in the number of}} re-ignitions after corrosion. None of the rusted slits gave re-ignition on the first explosion test, which is the most important. The main conclusion is that rust increased the efficiency of the flame gap to prevent a re-ignition in the secondary chamber. Experiments on mechanically milled crosswise grooves with different depth showed that the MESG value increased for the slits with the deepest grooves. One slit which had the smallest value of depth, had the same MESG value as for an undamaged slit. This means that crosswise grooves did not reduce the efficiency of the gap, and that the slit with deepest grooves in fact increased the efficiency. The overall conclusion from this experimental work is that surface roughness above the requirement given by the IEC standard does not reduce the efficiency of the flame gap for an internal ethylene gas explosion...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{ignition}} sources, such as motors, light switchers and relays {{that are}} located in an industrial area where an explosive atmosphere is a threat, must be designed {{in such a way}} that the ignition source does not ignite the hazardous atmosphere. Flameproof enclosures designed for electrical apparatus are constructed {{in such a way that}} the enclosure can withstand an internal explosion, without causing an external ignition of the explosive atmosphere. All holes and gaps on the enclosure are designed in accuracy to given requirements from international standards. Current international standard (IEC 2007 a) require that the maximal average roughness (Ra) of a flame gap surface is ≤ 6. 3 µm. The standard also requires that any damaged flame gap must be brought back to its original state. No technical argument is given by the current standard (IEC) to justify the requirements of an average roughness ≤ 6. 3 µm. In the present work it is applied severe damages on different flame gap surfaces. This involves highly rusted flame gap surfaces and flame gap surfaces with different perforating grooves over the entire length. The purpose of the experimental work has been to investigate how different damages on the flame gap surface affect their ability to prevent ignition of an external explosive gas mixture. The international standard (IEC 2007 a) also requires a maximum allowed gap opening/distance between the two joints that form the flame gap. This distance varies with the inner volume of the <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the width of the two joints. For the experimental set up in the present work the maximum allowed gap opening is 0. 40 mm. This gap opening contains a safety factor, which implies that the actual distance between the joints can be noticeably larger without causing a re-ignition of an external gas mixture. The largest width between the joints in a standardized test apparatus, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to the outside of the gap, is denoted as the MESG value (Maximum Experimental Safe Gap). This value is used in the present work as a parameter for judging if different damage on the gap surface reduce or improve the gap's ability to prevent a re-ignition. Flameproof enclosures {{are located in}} areas where an explosive gas/air mixture can be formed. Dust is represented in almost any atmosphere and many types of dust are combustible. In the present work it has been investigated how the presence of dust inside a <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> impacts the flame gaps ability to prevent a transmission of a gas explosion. The dust was not placed in the internal chamber, but sprinkled into the flame gap. This was to assure that the dust possibly found its way into the internal chamber by itself. The purpose of this work has been to investigate if dust can ignite inside the flame gap or the inner chamber, during an internal gas explosion and subsequently penetrate at a burning state into the external chamber and cause a re-ignition. To assure that the gas did not cause the possible re-ignition, the gap opening was set to a width smaller than the respective MESG value for an undamaged slit. It is performed experiments where the gap opening is set to the allowed width of 0. 40 mm for flameproof enclosures, given by the standard (IEC 2007 a). The apparatus used in the experimental work was mainly the Plane Rectangular Slit Apparatus (PRSA), but [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of explosive gas atmospheres have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of <b>flameproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 μm. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of flame path surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of flame proof apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the maximum permissible width in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the flame-proofing effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 μm) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA). For both apparatuses the optimal distance between the ignition point and the gap entrance for flame transmission was 14 mm. Consequently this distance was used in all the experiments. The flame gap surfaces were damaged mechanically by [...] ...|$|E
