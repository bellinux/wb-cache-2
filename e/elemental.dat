5|$|<b>Elemental</b> iodine {{is used as}} a {{disinfectant}} {{either as}} the element, or as the water-soluble triiodide anion I3− generated in situ by adding iodide to poorly water-soluble <b>elemental</b> iodine (the reverse chemical reaction makes some free <b>elemental</b> iodine available for antisepsis). <b>Elemental</b> iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elemental</b> {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of <b>elemental</b> chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, <b>elemental</b> chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. <b>Elemental</b> chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elemental</b> iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high <b>elemental</b> iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elementals</b> {{appeared}} in the fourth edition in the Monster Manual (2008). The basic <b>elementals</b> (earth, air, water and fire) do not appear until Monster Manual 3 (2010). In this edition, <b>elementals</b> can come in almost any shape, size, and composition imaginable.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Elementals</b> used N'Kantu, the Living Mummy, {{making him}} a slave, using him as a pawn against the Living Pharaoh to obtain the Ruby Scarab from them. Zephyr betrayed the other <b>Elementals</b> and allied with the Living Mummy. The <b>Elementals</b> {{attacked}} Zephyr, the Living Mummy, and their allies and gained the Scarab from them. When the <b>Elementals</b> tried to release their energies through the Scarab, they were blasted off Earth.|$|R

5|$|Kameo: Elements of Power is a 2005 action-adventure {{video game}} by Rare and Microsoft Studios {{released}} for the Xbox 360. The player controls the title character, an elf, who journeys to recover her <b>elemental</b> powers and captive family from her evil sister and the troll king. Kameo's ten <b>elemental</b> powers let her transform into creatures {{and use their}} varied abilities to solve combat-oriented puzzles and progress through the game's levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Elementals</b> (Fire/Water) have a ranged attack. They {{are fast}} and strong though weaker than Trolls and Demons. In addition, water <b>elementals</b> can stand in {{bodies of water}} as well as {{teleport}} between them with minimal effort; Fire <b>Elementals</b> can 'go nova' (a powerful suicide attack) on the strategic map.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Elementals</b> {{were later}} {{returned}} to Earth and pursued Zephyr and the Scarab. Ms. Marvel arrived and fought the <b>Elementals,</b> defeating {{them one by}} one.|$|R
50|$|Thor is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Comico comic book series <b>Elementals.</b> He was created by Bill Willingham and first appeared in <b>Elementals</b> #23 (Volume 1).|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} of boron compounds {{does not involve}} the formation of <b>elemental</b> boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.|$|E
5|$|About 86% of {{molybdenum}} produced {{is used in}} metallurgy, {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, stainless steel 25%, chemicals 14%, tool & high-speed steels 9%, cast iron 6%, molybdenum <b>elemental</b> metal 6%, and superalloys 5%.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{currently}} used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from {{the synthesis of}} Freon (Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of Teflon (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of <b>elemental</b> fluorine, which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which <b>elemental</b> fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The grue {{appears as}} a species of intelligent, evil <b>elementals</b> from the Inner Planes, {{presented}} {{as an alternative to}} the usual neutral, nonsentient summonable <b>elementals</b> of D&D.|$|R
50|$|While losing Wagner's characters, Rev {{did manage}} to buy <b>Elementals</b> for his restart. Comico began {{printing}} again in 1992 with various Elementals-related comics, and in 1993 flooded the market with various one-shot <b>Elementals</b> specials. They also created the Northstar imprint, which published material from 1991-1995. Budgetary problems and conflicts with creators over payments led to the company's presses going silent again until 1995, with yet another <b>Elementals</b> title (running three issues), and various <b>Elementals</b> spin-offs never making it past their first or second issues. Comico's line ended in 1997 with <b>Elementals</b> Sex Special vol. 2, #2, illustrated by Frank Quitely and Elementals: The Vampires Revenge #2, the second installment of a four-issue limited series starring the spin-off character Ratman, illustrated by Kelly McQuain.|$|R
25|$|Spirits {{are divided}} into four broad categories: demons, <b>elementals,</b> ghosts, and gods. With the {{exception}} of <b>elementals,</b> spirits are naturally immaterial, generally require Charms to materialize in Creation, and will reform when killed unless some supernatural effect prevents them from doing so. Rules for playing ghosts in 1st edition are presented in Exalted: The Abyssals, and rules for 2nd edition are presented in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V: The Roll of Glorious Divinity II: Ghosts & Demons. Rules for playing <b>elementals</b> and gods are presented in The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV: The Roll of Glorious Divinity I: Gods & <b>Elementals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although rare, {{deposits}} of native chromium exist. The Udachnaya Pipe in Russia produces {{samples of the}} native metal. This mine is a kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the reducing environment helped produce both <b>elemental</b> chromium and diamond.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they are}} {{strongly}} oxidative, many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are also}} explosive (highly exothermic), breaking down to <b>elemental</b> xenon and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk2S3, is {{prepared}} by either treating berkelium oxide {{with a mixture}} of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130°C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with <b>elemental</b> sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals.|$|E
50|$|All <b>elementals</b> have darkvision out to 60 feet. <b>Elementals</b> have {{immunity}} to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. They are also {{not subject to}} critical hits or flanking, due to their unique physiology.|$|R

50|$|Hecate {{appeared}} {{claiming to}} be an extradimensional female humanoid scientist and explorer, who was mistaken for the goddess Hecate when she visited Earth thousands of years ago. She allied with and later opposed the <b>Elementals</b> while seeking the Ruby Scarab. She fought Ms. Marvel {{at the time when}} the <b>Elementals</b> wanted to control the power of the Ruby Scarab. After the <b>Elementals</b> were defeated, Ms. Marvel forgave Hecate who took the Ruby Scarab in order to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.|$|R
5|$|Chromium is {{remarkable}} for its magnetic properties: {{it is the}} only <b>elemental</b> solid which shows antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38°C, it changes to paramagnetic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elemental</b> Spirits, {{also called}} Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic {{elements}} of the series' world, and are {{at the core of}} the games' magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since Secret of Mana, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters' meeting with them. In Legend of Mana, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In Legend of Mana and Sword of Mana, multiple spirits of the same <b>elemental</b> type appear. In terms of storyline, in Seiken Densetsu 3 and Heroes of Mana, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight <b>elemental</b> benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of SD3). In Dawn of Manas North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elemental</b> abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} learn magic, the party must rescue spirits known as <b>Elementals.</b> The eight <b>Elementals</b> {{represent}} different elements—such as water, earth, and life—and each provides the player with specific spells. Magic has skill levels similar to weapons, but each magic spell costs magic points to cast.|$|R
5|$|<b>Elemental</b> boron is a {{metalloid}} that {{is found}} in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several allotropes of boron exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of <b>elemental</b> boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, a side-scrolling Fantasia {{video game}} {{developed}} by Infogrames was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis system. The player controls Mickey Mouse, who must find missing musical notes scattered across four <b>elemental</b> worlds {{based upon the}} film's segments.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{has set the}} {{permissible}} {{exposure limit}} for <b>elemental</b> chlorine at 1 ppm, or 3mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has designated a recommended exposure limit of 0.5 ppm over 15 minutes.|$|E
