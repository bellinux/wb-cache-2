2500|$|Adoptions {{can occur}} either between related family members, or {{unrelated}} individuals. Historically, most adoptions occurred within a family. The most recent {{data from the}} U.S. indicates about half of adoptions are currently between related individuals. A common {{example of this is}} a [...] "stepparent adoption", where the new partner of a parent may legally adopt a child from the parent's previous relationship. <b>Intra-family</b> <b>adoption</b> can also occur through surrender, as a result of parental death, or when the child cannot otherwise be cared for and a family member agrees to take over.|$|E

The Finnish parliament's approval of a same-sex marriage law in late 2014 included provisions allowing same-sex couples to adopt. Female couples have more parental rights than male couples, given that allowing equal access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination was legalized in 2006. Surrogacy remains illegal for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples. Parentage rights for lesbian couples are complex; in 2016 a citizen's initiative calling on parliament to amend the law so as to allow female same-sex couples to have automatic parentage recognition in law. Currently, such couples have to carry out an <b>intra-family</b> <b>adoption</b> to be recognised as the parents {{of children who are}} conceived via fertility treatment.|$|E

He was sceptical about whether those who claim to be Cao Cao's descendants are really so, because genealogical records dating from the Song dynasty (960-1279) are already so rare in the present-day, much less those dating from the Three Kingdoms era (220-280). Besides, according to historical records, Cao Ding was a younger brother of the eunuch Cao Teng, who adopted Cao Cao's biological father, Cao Song. Therefore, Cao Cao had no known blood relations with Cao Ding. In other words, Cao Ding was not Cao Cao's real granduncle (this assuming {{that there was no}} <b>intra-family</b> <b>adoption,</b> which was actually common in China). Zhu Ziyan mentioned that Fudan University's research only proves that those self-proclaimed descendants of Cao Cao are related to Cao Ding; it does not directly relate them to Cao Cao.|$|E
