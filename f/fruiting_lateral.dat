Considering the extension of vegetative growth in mild winter climates regions, from March until November, and the huge amounts of hardwood wasted with pruning, three trials were accomplished aiming to exploit these features. In the first trial, floricane stem cuttings of three blackberry cultivars, ‘Arapaho’, ‘Ouachita’ and ‘Karaka Black’, were taken on 15 th February 2011 from three different positions in the cane: apical, mid, and basal sections, and rooted in substrate under intermittent moist conditions. The mean percentage of rooted stem cuttings differed significantly (P< 0, 05) between cultivars and cane position, with better results for top part of the cane than for bottom and middle parts. Differentiation state, lateral diameter and number of flower per lateral {{were not significantly different}} between treatments. It was observed that rotting occurred both from nodes and at base of the cuttings. After the <b>fruiting</b> <b>lateral</b> branch flowered, a vegetative behavior was observed with growth of several vegetative laterals. ‘Ouachita’ was the cultivar which produced the greater dry mass weight of vegetative laterals. Incomplete drupelet set was also observed. In a second trial, which studied the factors that could influence floricane stem cuttings rooting, hardhood cuttings of ‘Apache’ were rooted under three different conditions (light, sucrose and cut in the base of the axillary bud). Considering that none of these conditions led to roots production, the influence of each factor was studied based on the amount of callus formation. It was observed both for cuts in ends and in the base of the axillary bud of cuttings, that callus formation was dependent of light, with an increase of callus amount formed in its presence. The addition of sucrose negatively influenced the formation of callus at the base of cuttings. Lastly, a trial with nine blackberry cultivars of different types, (‘Olallie’, ‘Silvan’, ‘Karaka Black’, ‘Kotata’, ‘Boysenberry’, ‘Ouachita’, ‘Loch Tay’, ‘Chester Thornless’ and ‘Logan Thornless’) was conducted with the purpose of evaluate the cultivar suitability for double cropping in early spring and late autumn production, through production of long-cane from primocanes. For each cultivar, in half of plants, floricanes were suppressed and other half was maintained. Plants without floricanes did not produce more primocanes per plant than plants with floricanes. Plants without floricanes produced primocanes that had significantly greater cane lengths and node number but lower diameters. Relatively to rooting treatments, simple layering was the treatment who produced longer long-canes, except for ‘Ouachita’ where best results were obtained from layering 20 cm tipped primocanes. ‘Logan Thornless’ didn´t produced any long-cane. Considering the response of each cultivar to this new production system and their behavior in south-west Alentejo, the most adapted cultivars in each blackberry type are: ‘Karaka Black’ vii and ‘Olallie’ for trailing type, ‘Boysenberry’ for hybrids, ‘Ouachita’ to erect types and lastly ‘Chester Thornless’ to semi-erect types...|$|E

5000|$|The marionberry is a vigorously growing {{trailing}} vine, usually producing {{just a few}} canes up to 20 feet long. [...] The vines {{have many}} large spines, and the <b>fruiting</b> <b>laterals</b> are long and strong, producing many berries. The berry is glossy and, as with many blackberries, appears black on the plant, but turns a deep, dark purple when frozen and thawed. It is medium in size and tends to be conical, longer than it is wide. The berry has a somewhat tart flavor, fairly earthy with traces of sweetness. It is larger, sweeter and juicier than the 'Evergreen' blackberry. The relative complexity of its flavor {{has led to a}} marketing label as the “Cabernet of Blackberries”. The more powerful flavor of the marionberry has led to it dominating current blackberry production. It is often preferred over other blackberries as an ingredient in pies, ice cream, jellies, jams and other foods.|$|R

40|$|Protective {{cropping}} {{could be}} an effective system for growing specialty melons in the dry tropics of North Queensland. The growing system could reduce outdoor risks for production loss, improve fruit quality, increase yield per m 2, allow production offseason, and used for supplying niche markets in {{a segment of the}} larger melon market in Australia. First evaluations in Giru, Queensland, included seven cultivars of fruit types 'Galia', 'Hami', 'Charentais', small 'Canary', and 'Rockmelon', transplanted July 25, 2013 under a high polyethylene-covered tunnel. Plants were grown at a density of 2. 8 plants m- 2 in containers filled with volcanic rock and irrigated with a complete nutrient solution. Pruning and trellising was done to a single vertical stem, keeping lateral shoots on the main stem after the 7 th leaf node. After bearing small <b>fruit,</b> <b>lateral</b> shoots were cut off after their second or third leaf node. To facilitate insect pollination, a screen window in the tunnel was left partially opened. On November 20 the cultivars had combined marketable yields that ranged from 2. 8 to 8. 2 fruits m- 2 and 3. 1 to 7. 8 kg m- 2. Total soluble solids levels in fruit ranged from 6 to 13 °Brix. Cultivars 'Tempo' ('Galia'), 'Tikal' ('Canary') and 'Sultan' ('Charentais') had fruit yields that were up to 2. 6 times greater than yields commonly achieved with field-grown rockmelon crops. Sugar levels in fruits and marketable yields may be increased with changes in fertigation management. Promising results in this first evaluation justify examination of a greater number of genetic materials, in addition to the development of economic feasibility studies and further adaptive research to refine crop recommendations for growing melons in protective cropping systems...|$|R

Période 2000 - 2012. [URL] {{effect of}} two training systems (Central Leader with branch pruning versus Centrifugal Training with minimal pruning, i. e., removal of <b>fruiting</b> <b>laterals</b> only) on canopy structure and light interception was analyzed in three architecturally contrasting apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars: ‘Scarletspur Delicious’ (Type II); ‘Golden Delicious’ (Type III); and ‘Granny Smith’(Type IV). Trees were 3 D-digitized at the shoot scale at the 2004 and 2005 harvests. Shoots were separated according to length (short versus long) and type (fruiting versus vegetative). Leaf area density (LAD) and its relative variance (), total leaf area (TLA) and crown volume (V) varied consistently with cultivar. ‘Scarletspur Delicious’ had higherLADand and lowerTLAand V {{compared with the}} other cultivars with more open canopies. At the whole-tree scale, training {{had no effect on}} structure and light interception parameters (silhouette to total area ratio, STAR; projected leaf area, PLA). At the shoot scale, Centrifugal Training increased STAR values compared with Central Leader. In both training systems, vegetative shoots had higher STAR values than fruiting shoots. However, vegetative and fruiting shoots had similar TLA and PLA in Centrifugal Trained trees, whereas vegetative shoots had higher TLA and PLA than fruiting shoots in Central Leader trees. This unbalanced distribution of leaf area and light interception between shoot types in Central Leader trees partly resulted from the high proportion of long vegetative shoots that developed from latent buds. These shoots developed in the interior shaded zone of the canopy and therefore had low STAR and PLA. In conclusion, training may greatly affect the development and spatial positioning of shoots, which in turn significantly affects light interception by fruiting shoots...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 In {{spring of}} 1993 and 1994, mature 'Marion' (Rubus sp.) plants were pruned to 0, 4, 8, and 12 floricanes. An {{additional}} treatment of 0 floricanes with early (30 cm) primocane pruning was included. Primocane growth was measured from emergence in April until growth cessation {{at the end}} of October. Yield component analysis was completed after harvest during the first season and in the following season. Dry weight partitioning was determined in summer and winter. During the winter, cold hardiness of primocanes was determined by controlled freezing. In 1993, plants without floricanes produced more primocanes with a greater total length and showed a trend toward a greater number and length of primocane branches {{at the end of}} the season. In 1993, internode length was significantly reduced in plants with 0 or 4 floricanes compared to plants with 8 or 12 canes. In 1994, there were no significant differences in primocane growth among treatments. Primocane growth in all treatments occurred in flushes with plants without floricanes having a significantly higher absolute growth rate (AGR) on 5 dates compared to plants with floricanes in 1993. In 1994, there was no treatment effect on AGR over the season; however, plants without floricanes still had a greater primocane AGR than plants with floricanes on six dates before fruit harvest. During both years, there were approximately 5 - 7 peaks in AGR throughout the season. When comparing primocane growth at three phenological stages in 1993, plants with no floricanes had a significantly higher AGR during fruit production and from harvest to growth cessation than plants with floricanes. In 1994, plants with no floricanes had the highest rate of growth before bloom and a trend towards higher AGR during fruit production. After fruit production, there were no differences in AGR between the treatments in 1994. Plants with floricanes produced a second flush of primocanes while plants with no floricanes produced only one flush. Primocane length (averaged for 4, 8, and 12 floricane plants) of the first flush was significantly different from the second flush at all dates during the season except for the final end of season measurement. In 1993, primocane topping at 30 cm tended to decrease primocane number and total length. In 1994, there were no significant effects of topping except for increased branch length. Plants without floricanes produced primocanes that were significantly more cold hardy (lower LT₅₀) in 1994 and 1995 than plants with floricanes. All treatments had greater hardiness in 1995 than in 1994. In both 1993 and 1994, plants with four floricanes had significantly higher percent budbreak than plants with 12 floricanes. In 1993, plants with four floricanes also had significantly fewer nodes per cane, a shorter average cane length, reduced lateral length. and a lower number of branch canes compared to plants with 8 or 12 floricanes. In 1994, there were no variables affected by floricane number per plant other than percent budbreak. In 1993, there was no significant difference in yield between plants with 8 and 12 floricanes while plants with 4 floricanes had a lower yield. In 1994, yield per cane was significantly higher in plants with 4 floricanes compared to plants with 8 or 12 floricanes; yield per plant was not affected by floricane number. There were no significant treatment effects on berry weight in either year. In summer of 1993, there was a trend for a decrease in primocane dry weight and a significant decrease in branch dry weight with an increase in floricane number. Total plant, <b>fruit,</b> floricane and <b>lateral</b> dry weight increased linearly with increasing floricane number. Results were similar for floricane components in the summer of 1994, however, there were no treatment effects on primocane or branch dry weight. There was also a positive linear relationship between crown dry weight and floricane number in 1994. By the winter of 1994 and 1995, there were no treatment effects on primocane or crown dry weight. Plants without floricanes produced a significantly greater number of canes per plant than plants with floricanes in 1993 but not in 1994. Plants without floricanes produced primocanes that had a significantly lower percent budbreak the following year (1994) than plants with floricanes. There was a similar trend in 1995. Plants without floricanes had a higher number of nodes per branch and a greater average branch cane length than plants with 8 or 12 floricanes. Number of nodes per cane tended to decrease with increased floricane number per plant in 1994 and 1995. There was no significant treatment effect on <b>fruit</b> per <b>lateral,</b> berry weight or yield per plant in either 1994 or 1995. However, in 1994, plants without floricanes had the lowest yield per cane but the highest yield per meter of cane compared to plants with floricanes. Topping primocanes at 30 cm in 1993 had no significant effect on yield components the following season. The only variable significantly affected by pruning in 1994 was a reduction in <b>fruit</b> per <b>lateral</b> with primocane pruning. 'Marion' primocanes had a typical sigmoid growth curve similar to the growth pattern seen in red raspberry and other plants. Our findings of the emergence of two flushes of primocanes without primocane suppression and absolute growth rate occurring in peaks of growth throughout the season have not been previously reported in Rubus. Primocanes on plants with floricanes may have the ability to "catch up" to those on plants without floricanes after harvest as there were no differences in primocane dry weight by winter. In this study, we did not see an increase in yield in plants grown without floricanes the previous season as is generally found in 'Marion'. This may have been a result of winter training rather than primocanes being trained in the summer as they grew, a practice that improves light exposure to the canes. Yield compensation occurred through an increase in percent budbreak in plants with 4 floricanes compared to those with 8 or 12 canes...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Alexander the Great {{introduced}} this [...] "Persian nut" [...] (Theophrastus' καρυα ή Περσική) in Macedonian and Greek ancestral forms with <b>lateral</b> <b>fruiting</b> from Iran and Central Asia. They hybridized with terminal-bearing forms to give lateral-bearing trees with larger fruit. These lateral-bearers were spread in southern Europe and northern Africa by Romans. Recent prospections in walnut populations of the Mediterrean Basin allowed to select interesting trees of this type. In the Middle Ages, the lateral-bearing character was introduced again in southern Turkey by merchants travelling along the Silk Road. J. regia germplasm in China {{is thought to have}} been introduced from Central Asia about 2000 years ago, and in some areas has become naturalized.

Important nut-growing regions include France, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary in Europe; China in Asia; Baja California and Coahuila in Mexico, and Chile in Latin America. Lately, cultivation has spread to other regions, such as New Zealand and the southeast of Australia. It is cultivated extensively from 30° to 50° of latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and from 30° to 40° in the Southern Hemisphere. Its high-quality fruits are eaten both fresh or pressed for their richly flavored oil; numerous cultivars have been selected for larger nuts with thinner shells.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} on structure, chemical composition and properties of plant cells, tissues and organs several microscopic, chemical and physical methods have been applied during the last years. However, a knowledge gap exists about the location, quantity and structural arrangement of molecules in the native sample or what happens on the molecular level when samples are chemically or mechanically treated or how they respond to mechanical stress. These questions need to be answered to optimise utilization of plants in food industry and pharmacy and to understand structure-function relationships of plant cells to learn from natures unique. Advances in combining microscopy with Raman spectroscopy have tackled this problem in a non-invasive way and provide chemical and structural information in situ without any staining or complicated sample preparation. In this review the different Raman techniques (e. g. near infrared Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy (NIR-FT), resonance Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) are briefly described before approaches in plant science are summarised. Investigations on structural cell wall components, valuable plant substances, metabolites and inorganic substances are included with emphasis on Raman imaging. The introduction of the NIR-FT-Raman technique led to many applications on green plant material by eliminating the problem of sample fluorescence. For mapping and imaging of whole plant organs (seeds, <b>fruits,</b> leaves) the <b>lateral</b> resolution (∼ 10 µm) of the NIR-FT technique is adequate, whereas for investigations on the lower hierarchical level of cells and cell walls the high resolution gained with a visible laser based system is needed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate selected varieties of columnar apple trees. The trees were monitored over a 3 -year period and the focus was on growth, yield and health data. At the same time the quality of the harvested fruit was evaluated after short storage. The varieties Polka, Bolero, Charlotte, Mc. Intosh Wijcik, Waltz and the control variety Golden Delicious were grown on rootstock M 9. The decisive data characterising the variety were: the height of the elongation, formation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>fruiting</b> spurs, number of flowers and the amount of harvested fruit. No less important for growth was the health condition of the leaf area and particularly the incidence of fungus diseases; here the monitoring was carried out on six dates and was focused on apple scab and powdery mildew of apple. Infestation of the variety Charlotte with powdery mildew of apple was significantly heavier than infestation of the other varieties. The variety Charlotte was also significantly more affected with apple scab and differed from the other less infested varieties. The highest number of ripe fruit was produced by the variety Polka; significantly less fruit was produced by the varieties Bolero, Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Waltz. The least number of fruit but the heaviest was produced by the variety Charlotte; the weight of the fruit of this variety was significantly the highest. The variety Polka gave the highest yields. Evaluations of the organoleptic qualities included the appearance of the fruit; highly appraised in this respect was the control variety Golden Delicious, followed by Bolero and Mc. Intosh Wijcik. In terms of the appearance the variety Waltz received the lowest scores. The varieties Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Charlotte had the thickest skin, while the skin of varieties Polka, Golden Delicious and Waltz were of no concern. In terms of the consistence of the flesh the highest-ranking variety was Golden Delicious, followed by Bolero and Charlotte. The juiciest variety was Golden Delicious, followed by Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Waltz; the least juicy was the variety Charlotte. The tastiest variety was the control variety Golden Delicious, followed by Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Waltz; the least tasty was the variety Bolero. In the overall sum of points appraising the fruit, flesh and taste the variety Golden Delicious was at the top of the list, followed by Mc. Intosh Wijcik and Waltz...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Red {{raspberry}} (Rubus idaeus L.) is an outcrossing (but self fertile) diploid {{fruit crop}} that is clonally propagated (homogeneous within cultivars) and highly heterozygous. Raspberries grown for freezing and process markets are generally harvested by machine {{which requires a}} specific combination of plant and fruit traits. Successful red raspberry cultivars need to have high machine-harvested yield {{as well as a}} number of fruit quality attributes such as firm fruit, high sugar and acid content, dark colour, good flavour and enhanced human health properties. Quantitative genetic studies and, more recently, molecular plant breeding methods using DNA markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses are tools for increasing the breeding efficiency through better understanding of genetic parameters and genes controlling complex traits. Aims The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the inheritance and genetic parameters of yield and yield components of red raspberries, (ii) investigate the possibility of using key yield components to predict total machine-harvested yield of individual seedlings in a breeding programme, (iii) investigate the inheritance and genetic parameters of fruit quality traits and optimise tools for multi trait selection in a breeding programme, (iv) identify DNA markers associated with QTL for fruit quality traits. Materials and methods Two distinct populations were used. The first, used to study genetic parameters associated with machine-harvested raspberry yield and fruit quality was located in Washington State, United States and consisted of 45 parents giving rise to 85 families each with 12 seedlings from a double pairwise crossing design. Total yield (TYLD) and yield components; cane length (CLEN), cane number (NCAN), cane diameter (CDIA), number of buds/nodes (NBUD), percentage budbreak (PCBB), lateral length (LLEN), number of <b>fruit</b> per <b>lateral</b> (NFRT), berry weight (BWT) and fruit quality traits, fruit firmness (FIRM), soluble solid content (SS), titratable acid content (ACID), total anthocyanins (TACY) and total ellagitannins (TELG) were measured over three seasons and data analysed using mixed models and best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP). The second population, designed for genetic mapping from an interspecific F 1 cross between black raspberry (R. occidentalis) and red raspberry (R. idaeus) was used to create a genetic framework map using candidate gene markers from a number of species. QTL analysis was conducted for fruit quality traits SS, ACID and TELG. Results Variance component and BLUP analysis of data revealed TYLD had low narrow sense heritability (h²= 0. 25) but some yield components had higher heritability (e. g. LLEN h²= 0. 44, BWT h²= 0. 69) and high genetic correlation with TYLD (e. g. BWT r= 0. 80, CLEN r= 0. 54). The yield components BWT, LLEN and NFRT had low genotype by year (G×Y) interaction and were more stable over all seasons than CLEN, CDIA, PCBB, NBUD and NCAN. BWT and LLEN measured in the first two seasons were the two yield components that provided the best estimate of TYLD on mature plants in the second and third seasons. These results were from breeding values derived from hand harvested plants, a harvest method that is time-consuming and expensive to measure in breeding plots. Using a bulk family-plot machine-harvest yield we developed a strategy for estimating machine-harvest yield breeding values for our individual seedlings and found higher genetic gain per generation using estimated individual machine-harvest breeding values (7. 6 %) than using hand-harvested breeding values (6. 5 %). Fruit quality parameters, FIRM (h²= 0. 54), SS (h²= 0. 73), ACID (h²= 0. 45), TACY (h²= 0. 67) and TELG (h²= 0. 46) content had moderate to high narrow sense heritability and all but ACID (r=- 0. 35) and TACY (r=- 0. 28) were positively correlated with TYLD. G×Y interaction was low for all fruit quality traits measured. We applied a selection index to enable multiple trait selection for high yield as well as fruit quality traits, FIRM, SS, TACY and TELG. For fruit quality traits, SS, glucose, fructose, ACID, citric acid and TELG we found QTL that explained significant amounts of variation for these traits on our parental maps. DNA markers that were derived from candidate genes were closely linked to QTL for these traits. Discussion and conclusions TYLD has low heritability and is difficult to breed for; however, this study has shown that key components of yield can be used to select high yielding types in raspberry breeding populations. Further, we have shown that it is an efficient breeding strategy to use a machine to bulk harvest full-sib family plots and use key yield component data to relate these data to individuals within families. This new and innovative technique has potential to revolutionise breeding for improved yield in machine harvested berry crops. We have shown that fruit quality traits have good heritability and have low G×Y interaction and that it is possible to select for high yield as well as multiple fruit quality traits (including those negatively correlated to total yield) early in the life of plants using a selection index. Genomic regions and DNA-based markers associated with fruit quality traits measured in this study offer potential for further development and future marker-assisted selection...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In 1960 {{tests were}} {{initiated}} on the Marion blackberry (Rubus hybrid) {{to study the}} effect of (1) plant spacing, (2) time of training canes to the trellis and (3) amount of cane to train to the trellis with regard to fruit bud formation and total yield. Plant spacing varied with 2. 5, 5 and 10 feet between plants in the row. Time of training the canes to the trellis was approximately {{the middle of the}} months of August, September, October and February. The amount of cane trained on the trellis was either the entire length of all sound canes or only enough of each cane to reach the adjacent plant. Total yield of fruit, fruit spur determinations, time of fruit bud formation, leaf size and number and carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves were studied and/or measured. Although yield differences were greatest {{in the early years of}} the planting, 4 -year averages indicate that closer spacing of plants resulted in highly significant increases. August-trained canes produced the highest yields, followed in order by February, September and October. Differences in yield between the length of canes trained were very small and generally non-significant. When more cane grox<rth was trained, a corresponding increase in training time was required, particularly at the closer plant spacings. August and September training of canes stimulated the axillary buds to elongate and produce lateral growth. These laterals on August-trained canes matured enough to allow the formation of <b>fruit</b> buds, while <b>laterals</b> on September-trained canes were generally too succulent to form fruit buds. August-trained canes produced more fruit spurs per foot of row than February-trained canes. No difference in number of flower buds per fruit spur occurred between August and February training. Leaf counts on November 1 indicated that trellis training done in August produced more trifoliate leaves per foot of row than when the canes remained on the ground. Trifoliate leaves from ground-level training were larger. Axillary buds were collected at 2 -week intervals starting on August 1 and continuing until November 15 for the purpose of determining the time of fruit bud formation. The canes were divided into three sections, (1) basal, (2) mid-and (3) terminal, and each sampled separately. Buds from trellis-level training changed little during August and September; however, on October 2, buds from the terminal area only of canes and laterals were showing elongation. By mid-October, buds from all areas of the cane were showing an elongation of the apex. The first and only floral structure, expressed as a broadening and flattening of the apex, was observed in terminal section buds sampled on November 15. In contrast, basal and mid-section buds from canes trained along the ground during the summer showed an elongation of the apex by October 2, and by November 15 well defined floral structures were observed. Buds from the terminal section of cane were beginning to show some elongation by mid-November. Carbohydrate and nitrogen determinations were made on trifoliate leaves sampled from various loci on the canes on November 1. Older leaves, regardless of plant spacing or time of training, had the lowest nitrogen content. Carbohydrate content of leaves was quite variable. The C:N ratio was lowest for the 5 -foot spacing in both trellis-level and ground-level training. Leaves from the terminal area of the. canes had the lowest C:N ratio...|$|R
