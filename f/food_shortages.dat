5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation.

The {{aims of the}} thesis were to 1) characterise patterns of growth and development in response to short-term <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> during early development, 2) examine aspects of energy allocation during these responses with special emphasis on the basal level of energy metabolism, thermoregulatory ability and body composition and 3) investigate the effect of shortterm <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> on subsequent growth and fledging body size. dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|R

5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions {{to make more}} money for the family. They offered their discoveries for sale to {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused <b>food</b> <b>shortages.</b> The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against <b>food</b> <b>shortages.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the storm, the hardest hit {{residents}} faced <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> and lacked access to clean water, in an area already facing ongoing <b>food</b> <b>shortages.</b> In response, the World Food Programme and other agencies of the United Nations created a program to feed about 350,000people in the region over three months, providing about 5,900tons of food. In the months after the storm, roads were repaired, including the link from Vangaindrano to Midongy. Farmers grew additional beans and potatoes {{to compensate for the}} damaged crops, while the quick distribution of food prevented significant malnutrition. In the subsequent years, about 40% of the forest at Manombo that regrew following Gretelle was of foreign nature, which threatened the original plants in the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to <b>food</b> <b>shortages</b> in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the <b>food</b> <b>shortages,</b> no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nestlings seem {{to face a}} {{trade-off}} between reducing the basal level of energy metabolism, as an energy-saving response, and maintaining thermogenic capacity during temporal <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b> In the present study we examined developmental responses to short-term diet restriction of 12 – 16 day old nestling European shags kept under laboratory conditions and tested whether temporal <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> delay the development of homeothermy. During <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> the European shag nestlings substantially reduced basal level of energy metabolism, resulting in significant energy savings. The reduction in basal level of energy metabolism corre-sponded with a reduction in peak metabolic rate. At the same time, the low peak metabolic rate of diet-restricted nestlings was offset by a lower mass-specific minimal thermal conductance, and an increased mass-specific absolute scope. Consequently, the insulation and the portion of peak metabolic rate available for regulatory thermogenesis seemed to develop normally, as expected from age, {{during the period of}} <b>food</b> <b>shortage.</b> Further, the degree of homeothermy, measured as the index of homeothermy, was not significantly lower in diet-re-stricted nestlings compared to controls at the same age. We conclude that temporal <b>food</b> <b>shortage</b> did not sig-nificantly delay the development of homeothermy in the European shag nestlings despite substantial reductions in basal level of energy metabolism and peak metabolic rate...|$|R

5|$|After Nixon won re-election, {{inflation}} was returning. He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular {{with the public}} and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. The controls produced <b>food</b> <b>shortages,</b> as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E
