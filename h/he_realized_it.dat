Once he had approached the gunfire, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Golovkin {{purchased}} a beige-colored VAZ-2103 car, which he stored {{in his garage}} where he began constructing a basement, originally {{to be used as}} a workshop, however <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> could be used as a dungeon to commit his sexual crimes. From August 1990, Golovkin killed eight boys aged 10 to 15-years-old, on two occasions torturing two boys at the same time. In September 1992, Golovkin raped and killed three boys who he had lured into his garage, offering to commit theft from a warehouse. The last of them Golovkin tortured and raped for 12 hours and then hung up before he went to work.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} and social activity was disrupted in the village: widows {{had to take the}} jobs of their husbands; because of their lack of knowledge in the cultivation of land, harvested very little corn and beans. There were diseases, especially among children and the elderly, there was no food or clothing. The teacher of the village came only part-time, mostly out of fear, but left after <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was not worth to stay because young people had to work. Nor could they spend money on travel. The village had no teacher for the next four years. The events generated finally the breakup of the community. Some village women though that their husbands were killed because of three others who were linked with the guerrillas and were involved in a land dispute.|$|E
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands}} of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E

500|$|After {{seeing the}} initial {{proposal}} for [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", Barrett {{felt that she}} could play the woman who went into space to find her fiance. She dyed her hair blonde {{in an attempt to}} fit the role. Barrett sought to surprise Roddenberry at his office, but he walked right past her, not recognizing who she was. It was only when he came back out give his secretary some papers that <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was Barrett. They had the idea that it might get her past the NBC executives and back onto the show. The character of Christine Ducheaux was subsequently changed to Christine Chapel by Roddenberry, as a play on the Sistine Chapel. No other actresses were considered for the role.|$|E
500|$|Xenogears entered {{development}} in 1996 {{and was released}} in 1998. The game's soundtrack was Yasunori Mitsuda's first major solo work, as his previous soundtracks were collaborations with other composers {{with the exception of}} the score to , which never saw an album release. Mitsuda worked closely with Masato Kato, the event planner and script writer of Xenogears, to compose the score. Mitsuda considered it hard at times to maintain his motivation throughout the whole two-year period, especially since he had to wait for the end to see the most dramatic tracks implemented. The game's director Tetsuya Takahashi did not initially think [...] "music was all that important" [...] compared to graphics, but eventually acknowledged its importance when <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> could strongly enhance the expressivity of the images. Takahashi explained that without Mitsuda's music, he would not have been able to achieve his goals for the project.|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I {{was in the back}} of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E

500|$|Ball {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by two encounters {{he had in}} the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt like there was a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E
500|$|While {{the final}} version of [...] "Part Two" [...] is quite enclosed, the initial script was {{considered}} epic, with production designer Jerry Wanek jokingly referring to it as a [...] "six-hour mini-series". In the original version, the giant devil's trap keeping demons away from the gateway to Hell was much more complex, with each point in the pentagram being a church housing a holy relic—such as a sliver from the True Cross. With the artifacts powering the devil's trap, Jake's role would have been to go to each church and destroy them, the hunters following after him to try to stop him. Jake would then eventually destroy the final relic during a fight with Sam, and Dean would race to the gateway to prevent Azazel from opening it while Jake and Sam are [...] "beating the crap out of each other". However, when director and executive producer Kim Manners received the script, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was huge, and had the storyboard artist make five-and-a-half hours of storyboards for the episode to prove that it could not be filmed without going {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} over-budget. Production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting the churches, which were major set pieces for the intended story. Kripke realized that instead of using churches, he could have the points of the pentagram be connected by railroad tracks. With tracks being made of iron, it fit perfectly with the series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent. Kripke found this aspect to be more Western, matching the tone of show. Rather than destroying the devil's trap as in the original script, Jake is instead sent by Azazel to open the gateway himself, and the major fight scene between Jake and Sam was then changed into a standoff between Jake and the hunters. Though the storyline had to be toned down, Kripke felt that this improved the overall episode by making it simpler.|$|E
2500|$|Kaasen {{traveled}} through the night, through drifts, and river overflow over the [...] Topkok Mountain. Balto {{led the team}} through visibility so poor that Kaasen could not always see the dogs harnessed closest to the sled. He was two miles (3km) past Solomon before <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it,</b> and kept going. The winds after Solomon were so severe that his sled flipped over and he almost lost the cylinder containing the serum when it fell off and became buried in the snow. He acquired frostbite {{when he had to}} use his bare hands to feel for the cylinder.|$|E

After doing some street racing, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was too {{dangerous}} and started drag racing at a track. He won the first event that he entered in the C/Gas category. His Chevy was nicknamed [...] "Hang 'Em High" [...] because his wheelstands scraped the car's bumper. His next car was a big block 1957 Chevy nicknamed [...] "Rat Poison". He drove a series of doorslammers and appeared to be a Pro Stock driver, but then he decided to start racing the faster funny cars.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{record of}} JFK {{assassination}} coverage currently available from a Chicago radio station {{comes from a}} non-network station, WGN. [...] Host Orion Samuelson was {{on the air with}} Country Fair, a program of agricultural news, when the first bulletins were received. [...] After reading the bulletins, Samuelson resumed the regularly scheduled program, periodically interrupting with further bulletins, until a union record-turner arrived and Samuelson was able to end his program, at which time the station began playing somber easy-listening instrumental music as staff and listeners awaited further bulletins. [...] Samuelson recalled years later that he had initially thought fellow staffers were playing a joke on him with the initial bulletins about the shooting, until <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was real.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. bought houses in the South of France, {{in order to be}} near Bono and The Edge's homes so they could have a place to both [...] "work and play". That year, a bag holding {{personal}} papers and a laptop computer containing lyrics for the album was taken from Bono's car, which was parked outside Dublin's Clarence Hotel, which is owned by Bono and The Edge. Bono offered a reward of £2,000 for the return of the computer. An Irish man returned the laptop after having bought it for £300 thinking it was from a reputable source. <b>He</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was Bono's when he saw a picture of the singer's child Elijah Bob on the screen, prompting him to contact U2's management.|$|E

2500|$|Relations between Ferreira de Carvalho and the Japanese deteriorated. His {{telegraph}} {{link with}} the Portuguese Government in Lisbon was cut. In June 1942, a Japanese official complained that the Governor had rejected Japanese demands to punish Portuguese officials and Timorese and civilians who had assisted the [...] "invading army" [...] (the Australians). On 24 June, the Japanese formally complained to Lisbon, but did not take any action against Ferreira de Carvalho. Meanwhile, Doi once again sent Ross with a message, complimenting Sparrow Force on its campaign so far, and again asking that it surrender. The Japanese commander drew a parallel with the efforts of Afrikaner commandos of the Second Boer War and said that <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> would take a force 10 {{times that of the}} Allies to win. Nevertheless, Doi said he was receiving reinforcements, and would eventually assemble the necessary units. This time Ross did not return to Dili, and he was evacuated to Australia on 16 July.|$|E
2500|$|At one point, The Long Good Friday director, John Mackenzie, {{was linked}} with the film. When Carlito's Way and its sequel After Hours were optioned, Martin Bregman had Abel Ferrara in mind. However, when Bregman and Ferrara parted ways, De Palma was brought in. Bregman {{explained}} that this decision was not about [...] "getting the old team back together", rather than making use of the best talent available. De Palma, reluctantly, read the script {{and as soon as}} Spanish-speaking characters cropped up he feared it would be Scarface all over again. He said {{that he did not want}} to make another Spanish-speaking gangster movie. When De Palma finally did read it all the way through, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> was not what he thought it was. De Palma liked the script and envisioned it as a noir movie. Bregman supervised casting throughout the various stages of pre-production, and carefully selected the creative team who would make the film a reality. This included production designer Richard Sylbert, editor Bill Pankow, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard and director of photography Stephen Burum.|$|E
2500|$|In earlier {{versions}} of Jackson's script, Sauron does indeed [...] "come forth" [...] at Aragorn's challenge, and does battle with him: The extra materials published together with the extended DVD version of the third movie indicate as much. Scenes of the fight were shot, but later this idea was discarded {{and was replaced by}} a scene (in the extended version) where Aragorn kills the [...] "Mouth of Sauron" [...] (a representative of Sauron) before fighting a Mordor troll. In fact, the footage of the battle with the troll was the same footage of Aragorn fighting Sauron, with the CGI troll mapped over a painted-out Sauron, as seen in the DVD special features. In this abandoned scene, when Sauron first emerges from the Black Gate, he appears in his fair and seductive form as [...] "Annatar the Lord of Gifts", trying to entice Aragorn and the other leaders with offers of peace and dominion. [...] When they reject him, he reverts to his true form, as seen in the prologue. [...] Jackson said he removed the scene when <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> {{was too much of a}} departure from the source material and thematically missed the point: the battle was supposed to be a selfless sacrifice by Aragorn and his army, and making it into a duel between Aragorn and Sauron made it more about personal glory.|$|E
