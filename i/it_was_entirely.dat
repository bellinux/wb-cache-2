5|$|The bishops {{continued}} to use the title Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury until finally renouncing their claim to Glastonbury in 1219. Services in the reconsecrated Great Church had begun on Christmas Day, 1213, most likely before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> completed. King Edward I and Queen Eleanor attended the magnificent service at the reburial of King Arthur's remains {{to the foot of}} the High Altar in 1278.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Loveppears is {{the second}} studio album by Japanese {{recording}} artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released in Japan, Hong Kong and China on November 10, 1999 through Avex Trax and the China Record Corporation, and distributed worldwide on April 10, 2001 by Avex Entertainment Inc. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> written by Hamasaki herself, while the production was handled by Japanese musician Max Matsuura. Musically, Loveppears is a dance album and lyrically focuses on themes of love, frustration of life, loneliness, and individualism.|$|E
5|$|The 1879 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1879 college football season. The team {{was the first}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played just a single game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. The school would not have another football squad until 1882.|$|E
5|$|Bislett {{remained}} a speed skating venue until 1988, after which it only hosted athletics and football. Between 1925 and 1986, it saw 13 world championships and 10 European championships in speed skating. The structure was demolished {{and replaced with}} a new stadium in 2005. It hosts the annual Bislett Games, {{now part of the}} Diamond League in athletics. Marienlyst is used as a football stadium, and hosts both Strømsgodset IF and the Norway national under-21 football team. Lillestrøm, Dælenenga and Kadettangen are only used for lower-level football, as they lack any significant spectator stands. Jordal Amfi received a roof in 1972 and hosted the World Ice Hockey Championships in 1958 and 1999. Holmenkollbakken has been rebuilt several times since the Olympics; most recently <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> rebuilt in 2010. The complex has received a ski stadium, collectively known as Holmenkollen National Arena. In addition to the annual Holmenkollen Ski Festival, the hill hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, {{less for}} the sake of its golden decorations than as a {{political}} gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city. French soldiers broke up the carved wooden portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed {{at the mouth of the}} Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> destroyed in 1824.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{provided}} an opportunity for improving the visuals and gameplay. The visuals were given more contrast, so objects stood out more. Improvements to the lighting was a major focus for the team. The game's engine was also improved, along with character animations and facial movement. Due to the relatively small size of the DLC environment, developers {{did not need to}} focus on a raised concern in the main game about repeating character faces and voices. An element that had been generally criticized by both critics and players of the original game was the boss fights, which had been outsourced to Grip Entertainment and consequently did not follow the player-driven gameplay style {{of the rest of the}} game, instead focusing heavily on action. While a boss fight was included in The Missing Link, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> developed in-house by Eidos Montréal staff and allowed for a variety of solution for defeating the boss, including non-lethal options.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned whether or not <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent to relatives or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
