5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker {{on the bar}} at Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L. After the latter sunk, 10people drowned, including the captain. No specific locations are known for these shipwrecks so no complete track for this storm is known, but it {{was active in the}} western Gulf of Mexico beginning on September18. The storm made landfall early on September19 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rural</b> area of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico. Based on John Kaplan and Mark DeMaria's inland decay model created in 1995, it is estimated that the cyclone dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rural</b> parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
