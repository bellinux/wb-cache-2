40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of H 2 O, Na, K, Ca and Mg content in the oocytes of bream, Abramis brama observed in prespawning period on breeding ground and in reply to catching, transportation and subsequent remaining of spawners in a cage. Methods: For research on {{the dynamics of}} H 2 O and cations content in the oocytes of bream females, Abramis brama {{in the course of}} eggs transition from maturity Stage IV to Stage V, fishes were caught from breeding ground in the coastal zone of the Volga Reach of the Rybinsk reservoir at the Vereteya Station. For studying the influence of stress, the bream (76 individuals) were caught from breeding <b>ground</b> by <b>hauling</b> the seine during 15 min. Capture, sorting and transportation for 3 h to the ponds were the stress factors. Samples of oocytes from 6 â€“ 8 fishes were taken immediately after capturing, then two more were taken during transportation. Later fishes were removed from the cage in certain time intervals. Concentration of Na and K in the dissolved samples of oocytes was measured by the spectrometer (Flapho- 4, Carl Zeiss, Iena, Germany) and content of Ca and Mg was measured by atomic-absorption spectrometer- 1 (the same producer). Results: In natural conditions before spawning in the course of maturation of oocytes from maturity Stage IV to V, H 2 O content in the ovicells of bream has increased by 3. 3...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 1986 Hauling site fidelity, {{movement}} patterns, and {{the proportion}} of harbor seals hauling out were examined for one year by radiotagging 12 seals in the Klamath River, California. Hauling site fidelity was highest during the spring and summer months, with 42 % of the tagged seals traveling from nearby <b>hauling</b> <b>grounds</b> to forage in the river. The majority of seasonal movements and dispersals originated during winter months, with subadult seals exhibiting a greater tendency for movement than adults. Seasonal movements coincided with the abundance of common prey items, pupping, breeding, and moulting activities. Tagged female seals made a significantly larger proportion of seasonal and local moves than males. Seals hauled out an average of 56. 1 ?? 2. 8 % (standard error) of the days in April and 63. 6 ?? 5. 5 % (S. E.) in May. Based on resightings, a minimum of 56. 4 ?? 3. 1 % (S. E.) and 65. 1 ?? 12. 8 % (S. E.) of the study area harbor seal population hauled out daily in April and May. The maximum recorded count corrected for the proportion of animals hauled out suggests that from 522 to 778 harbor seals were present in the study area {{at the peak of the}} season in May 1983...|$|R
500|$|Having learnt of {{the ongoing}} Cold War and the {{doctrine}} of mutually assured destruction from Stepashin, Skaldak {{plans to use the}} submarine's nuclear missiles to provoke a global thermonuclear war and destroy humanity as revenge for the humans attacking him - under the Martian code humanity as a whole has declared war on the Ice Warrior race by assaulting him. Reaching the bridge, he is able to connect himself to the sub's missile guidance systems and activate the missiles. The Doctor and Clara are attempting to persuade Skaldak to show mercy when the sub is rocked by a tractor beam from above: the Ice Warriors have arrived over the site of the submarine's undersea <b>grounding,</b> and they <b>haul</b> it to the surface. Skaldak is beamed aboard the Ice Warriors' spaceship, though the missile launch system is still active. Showing mercy, Skaldak deactivates the missiles remotely. When the Doctor's sonic screwdriver informs him the TARDIS has reappeared, he informs Clara that it had [...] "relocated" [...] to the South Pole automatically as part of the H.A.D.S. ("Hostile Action Displacement System"), which the Doctor admits he reactivated by accident while fiddling with the controls. As they are at the North Pole, an embarrassed Doctor asks Zhukov for a lift to get the TARDIS before saluting the Ice Warrior ship as it leaves.|$|R
60|$|They went at {{the work}} with a rush, and the little oblong marked out upon the prairie sod became alive with toiling figures. Tall birch posts rose as by magic, with {{struggling}} men thrusting with the long pike-poles beneath them; stringers, plates and ties seemed to fly into place; and Alison, sitting on the grass with Mrs. Farquhar, wondered as the skeleton of the house grew moment by moment before her eyes. She had never thought it possible that a dwelling could be built in a night; but the men were clearly on their mettle, and they worked with an almost bewildering activity. They were on the <b>ground</b> one minute, <b>hauling</b> ponderous masses of timber, and the next climbing among the framing; were standing with one foot on a slender beam, or crawling along another on hands and knees. There was a constant thudding of ax-heads on wooden pegs, a sharper ringing of hammers on heavy nails; curt orders broke through the clatter of boards and the persistent crunch of saws. Still, {{there seemed to be}} no confusion. Each man knew exactly what to do, for, though houses are by no means invariably raised in this fashion on the prairie, some of the men had learned their work in the bush of Michigan, and some in Ontario. When the hammers clattered more furiously and the skeleton became partly clothed, there were cries of encouragement from the women.|$|R
40|$|Indonesia is {{maritime}} country surrounding by Wide Ocean. Two seasons {{that always}} {{happened in this}} area have been influence to the situation of oceanography and fisheries zone. The seasons which happened because influence by wind of monsoon, which are West Monsoon, East Monsoon, and the transition condition among both. The fishing ground information used Geography Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) software {{and can be used}} for specific purpose. The most fundamental application is for dynamics population and distribution of fish in the ocean ecosystem. Environmental characteristics such as: temperature, thermo clines, salinity, ocean currents, and depth is identify potential fishing use technology of image satellite represent the way of identifying indirectly. From satellite data far identified by interconnected oceanography parameters sliver with fish habitation or potential schooling fish. Between oceanography parameter having relation with life of pelagic fish is water temperature go out to sea and fertility of territorial water area. Map of conducive satellite data, sea surface temperature (SST) and content of chlorophyll-a the can be obtained by information about oceanography phenomena specially front thermal and upwelling representing potency area as fishing indicator. Fishing vessel usually leave fishing base without exactly knowing location of fishing ground so it always stay in uncertainty potential location of fishing <b>ground,</b> therefore its <b>haul</b> also becoming not surely. Meanwhile, in consequence of uncertainty fishing location, resulted fishing ship passing many time and fuel to looking for location of fishing ground. Successfully of the fishing operation is not depend by experience of fishing master but there are must be have the data where fishing ground located. And application of semi active fishing gear much help fisherman salary and require following by other sub-province especially at the west season, but having to limit by usage mesh size enabled by law or regulation so that small fish do not follow to be caught...|$|R
50|$|Vivian, meanwhile, {{is on her}} honeymoon and Victor notices her preoccupation. He {{threatens to}} end the {{marriage}} and make her life very difficult {{if anything happens to}} Carly. Vivian, however, discovers that Chloe was in the elevator and has survived. She vows to punish Chloe for failing to kill Carly. Now, Vivian wants to get rid of Maggie, whom she thinks Victor has eyes on. Her evil plan is similar to Carly's but putting her in a sarcophagus and try to bury her alive. With her henchmen, Gus, she may be able to pull it off, but Melanie thinks Maggie is leaving town. Under the ruse of creating a celebration of Isabella Toscano's (Brady's mother and Victor's daughter) life, Vivian commences her plan to kidnap and entomb Maggie in a new sarcophagus, which has supposedly been purchased to contain Isabella's remains. Vivian gets overly confident, and, hence, sloppy {{in the final stages of}} her plan. Her trusty assistant, Gus, gets cold feet and quits. Brady happens upon her plan and discovers what Vivian has planned and that she has deposited his mother's remains in a pet cemetery. Brady ends up interring Vivian in the sarcophagus rather than Maggie, to Vivian's horror. Vivian is freed by Gus and they entomb Maggie. Victor frees Maggie and plans for Vivian to be arrested but Brady decides she deserves to be free. Vivian and Gus are then dropped on an island but Brady rescues him in June. We discover that Vivian had an affair years ago and has a son Quinn who is a pimp. Quinn is blackmailing Chloe into becoming a prostitute but no one besides Chloe and Taylor knows what his occupation is. At first he doesn't get along with Vivian because she abandoned him but he soon turns around and agrees to give his mother a second chance much to Gus's dismay. Carly develops a drug addiction to Vivian's delight, however Quinn helps Carly through it and Vivian disowns him. Months later, Vivian and Quinn reconcile and Vivian's side-kick, Gus frames Quinn for a series of assaults on prostitutes when in reality, he is the culprit. On September 21, 2011 it is revealed that Quinn is innocent and Gus is guilty when Gus' latest victim (Chloe Lane) comes out of the coma caused by his attack on her, at which time Gus takes Nicole Walker hostage in the police station. Gus is eventually wrestled to the <b>ground</b> and <b>hauled</b> off to a jail cell to await trial. Vivianâ€™s friend/former-henchman, Ivan suddenly returns to Salem, shows her the great wealth he has acquired as a Bollywood movie director/producer, expresses his undying love to her, and then takes her with him to India to make her a movie star, and open a new chapter in their lives together as equals.|$|R
