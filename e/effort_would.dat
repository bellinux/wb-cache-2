5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|The anti-infiltration <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be {{supported}} by MSQ-77 Combat Skyspot, a ground-based radar bombing system first introduced in Southeast Asia in 1966 to direct B-52 strikes in poor weather or in complete darkness. This system was utilized to direct one-quarter of all strike missions conducted by U.S. aircraft during the conflict. Combat Skyspot was complemented by expanding the radio-based LORAN system utilized by other strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding weather modification effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad. After consulting with the British Government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be {{in the form of an}} infantry division, the 2nd New Zealand Division, under the command of Major General Bernard Freyberg. The new division would require nine battalions of infantry and consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective. As he planned his expedition, Scott {{saw no reason to}} believe that his <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be contested. However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in quick succession by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

5|$|Prost {{went on to}} win the 1977 Formula Renault European {{championship}} {{before moving}} up to Formula Three (F3) in 1978. In 1979 he won both the French and European F3 championships, by which time he was on the shopping lists of several Formula One teams. After carefully considering his options, he chose to sign with McLaren for 1980. He surprised the British team by declining their offer of a race drive in a third car at the final race of the 1979 season at Watkins Glen — reasoning that the token <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> benefit neither him nor the team.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank {{issued a}} decree {{requiring}} all Kraków Jews {{to leave the}} city within the next two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1968, {{a fire at}} {{the former}} {{incinerator}} plant off Route 611, where the Peace Candle was being stored, destroyed the four smaller candles that surround {{the base of the}} larger candle. The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating {{the construction of a new}} Peace Candle prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be made to rebuild them. Instead, the committee would build an entirely new candle within a year.|$|E

5|$|The {{sides of}} the Tor have seven deep, roughly {{symmetrical}} terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed {{as a result of}} natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected that the <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved. Alternatively, the flattened paths may have been created by the hooves of grazing cattle.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing welding goggles, he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E

25|$|Conditions {{were so bad}} at Flößberg, {{that the}} commandant told the SS to make some improvements, not because {{of concern for the}} prisoners' welfare, but because missile {{production}} and therefore, the war <b>effort,</b> <b>would</b> be negatively affected.

25|$|Snagging {{had been}} banned on many New York State waters before the early 1990s, however the {{practice}} continued on the Salmon River {{and several other}} Lake Ontario tributaries due to fears of potential negative economic impacts caused by the ban.

25|$|Much of Puebla’s {{art scene}} had {{disappeared}} before the 20th century {{but in the}} 1920s, {{a group of young}} artists from the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Puebla (School of Fine Arts of Puebla) began to band together for mutual support. These artists eventually caught the attention and patronage of artists such as Diego Rivera and Dr. Atl and received visitors such as David Alfaro Siquieros, Frida Kahlo, Francisco Cornejo and Alfredo Guati Rojo. This <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> become the Barrio del Artista.|$|E
25|$|Running from Anderson's Plantation {{across the}} hill and {{back down to the}} old {{driveway}} near to the walled garden is a wall or dyke replacing a tree lined hedge shown in 1858. The wall or dyke is very unusual in that it is made from roughly equal sized rounded whinstones and it is held together by cement. A great deal of expense and <b>effort</b> <b>would</b> have been needed to build this long section of dyke, which seems to have been in place by 1911.|$|E
