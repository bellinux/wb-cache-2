25|$|In {{the colonial}} period, basic {{patterns}} of regional development emerged and strengthened European settlement and institutional life {{was built on}} the Mesoamerican heartland of the Aztec Empire in Central Mexico. The South (Oaxaca, Michoacan, Yucatán, and Central America) was also in the region of dense indigenous settlement of Mesoamerica, but in the absence of <b>exploitable</b> <b>resources</b> of interest to Europeans, the South attracted few Europeans, while the indigenous presence remained strong. The North was outside region of complex indigenous populations, but with the discovery of silver in the region of nomadic and hostile northern indigenous groups, the Spanish sought to conquer or pacify those peoples in order to exploit the mines and develop enterprises to supply them. Since much of northern New Spain attracted few Europeans and had a sparse indigenous population, the Spanish crown and later the Republic of Mexico did not effectively exert sovereignty of the region, leaving it vulnerable to the expansionism of the United States in the nineteenth century.|$|E

Columbus's second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that. On Hispaniola, the city of Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus's brother Bartholomew Columbus and became a stone-built, permanent city.|$|E

2500|$|The United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least {{developed}} country (LDC) {{because of its}} limited potential for economic development, absence of <b>exploitable</b> <b>resources</b> and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks.

In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least {{developed country}} (LDC) status to a Developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as [...] "Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs". Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status.

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (EC, 2000) imposes the EU {{member states}} to assess the {{quantitative}} and qualitative status of all surface- and groundwaters. A key aspect {{in the assessment of}} the groundwater bodies is the establishment of a comprehensive and coherent conceptual understanding of the system. Such an assessment has been carried out in Denmark by the construction of a national water resources model from which the <b>exploitable</b> <b>resource</b> was estimated taken into account that the extractable resource is limited by pollution of shallow aquifers and an unacceptable depletion in the stream base-flow. Compared to previous estimates of the groundwater resource based on more simplistic mass balance approaches the <b>exploitable</b> water <b>resource</b> was nearly halved by the use of an integrated hydrological model. This result clearly indicates that the groundwater system is complex and the resource difficult to evaluate without the use of integrated models describing all relevant processes of the freshwater resources.

40|$|Conditions {{that lead}} to human rights {{violations}} are often {{the same as those}} that generate environmental degradation, social inequalities and labour standards violations - when bad things happen, they tend to create clusters of injustice. These conditions include the operation of tentacular capitalism the existence of poor governance where legal protections, should they exist, are not acted upon. Alternatively, there may be an authoritarian regime, civil conflict or war, in which case rule of law is largely absent. Whatever the specific circumstances, there is usually a vulnerable and initially inactive community and a habitat that has come to be seen as an <b>exploitable</b> <b>resource.</b> Using cases on forced labour, slavery and child labour, this chapter explores the limits of corporate responsibility and the potential of corporate citizenship in tackling environmental degradation as well as human rights and labour standard violations...|$|R

40|$|Levels of {{economic}} development vary widely within countries in the Americas. This paper argues that part of this variation {{has its roots in}} the colonial era. Colonizers engaged in different economic activities in different regions of a country, depending on local conditions. Some activities were"bad"in the sense that they depended heavily on the exploitation of labor and created extractive institutions, while"good"activities created inclusive institutions. The authors show that areas with bad colonial activities have lower gross domestic product per capita today than areas with good colonial activities. Areas with high pre-colonial population density also do worse today. In particular, the positive effect of"good"activities goes away in areas with high pre-colonial population density. The analysis attributes this to the"ugly"fact that colonizers used the pre-colonial population as an <b>exploitable</b> <b>resource.</b> The intermediating factor between history and current development appears to be institutional differences across regions and not income inequality or the current ethnic composition of the population.
