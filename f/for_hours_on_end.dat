Liaohe would eventually {{become one of the}} China National Petroleum Corporation's (CNPC) largest oil fields. Zhou was seen as a hard-working and emotionally mature presence to his colleagues; he did not drink or smoke, and would rarely speak based on script. He would reputedly talk unscripted <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> while keeping his colleagues engaged.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} for tuberculosis {{during this time}} was isolation (hence the sanatoria) and artificial pneumothorax or lung compression. In December 1944 Madonna Swan {{was taken to the}} Sioux Sanatorium in Rapid City, SD. During her many years at the San, as it was referred to, Madonna was treated for her TB by the placement of bean bags on her chest while lying flat on the back <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> This was the way that pneumothorax or lung compression was accomplished. The thought being that the collapsing of the lung would kill the mycobacterium tuberculosis by eliminating the air which the bacterium needed to grow, an idea supported by observations by the Italian physician Carlo Forlanini. This treatment did not however provide a cure for Madonna Swan.|$|E
25|$|The empress {{developed}} extremely {{rigorous and}} disciplined exercise habits. Every castle {{she lived in}} was equipped with a gymnasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber {{so that she could}} practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.|$|E
25|$|Conditions in {{the factory}} were not agreeable, however. The main problem was that several foremen and {{departmental}} heads regarded workers as still being in the army – which they were, but only in theory, since most had been officially ‘discharged’ as unfit for active service at the front. These bosses ruled the workshops under the full might of military law. One of the main clauses of that military law insisted the men should wear military uniform at all times. ‘At all times’ meant everywhere except in the home – {{on the streets of}} the village, going out into Birtley itself (with appropriate military pass) and above all at work, even if that necessitated working <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> next to one of the furnaces operating at several hundred degrees.|$|E

25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the Summer of Love, which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E

It was also announced that Williams would perform hit singles from his solo career during the tour. The band then played at some of the biggest venues across Europe for the second leg of the tour. The phenomenal demand for tickets across the country led to the web sites of all the major UK ticket suppliers either crashing or considerably slowing <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> The demand and sheer volume of fans also created problems for the UK telephone network. Take That's Progress Live also broke all records for ticket sales selling over 1.1million tickets in one day, smashing the previous box office record set by Take That's Circus tour in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tendulkar {{played as}} a youngster with his brother, Ajit, for Sahitya Sahawas society’s cricket team at Bandra East. Ajit is {{credited}} by Sachin for playing {{a pivotal role in}} his life. Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin {{on the top of the}} stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions. He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.|$|E

500|$|The Queen's health {{remained}} fair {{until the}} autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a [...] "settled and unremovable melancholy", and sat motionless on a cushion <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> When Robert Cecil {{told her that she}} must go to bed, she snapped [...] "Must is not a word to use to princes, little man". She died on 24 March 1603 at Richmond Palace, between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James VI of Scotland as James I of England.|$|E
500|$|Garland {{always had}} a large base of fans in the gay community, which {{includes}} Wainwright, who identifies as gay and came out to his parents {{at the age of}} 14. A connection is frequently drawn between the timing of Garland's death and funeral, in June 1969, and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern Gay Liberation movement. Coincidental or not, the proximity of Garland's death to Stonewall has become a part of LGBT history and lore. Wainwright, having been called the [...] "first post-liberation era gay pop star", was obsessed with The Wizard of Oz (1939) as a child and would dress in his mother's gown, [...] "pretend to be either the Wicked Witch – melting <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> – or the Good Witch, depending on his mood". Wainwright also claims his mother (Canadian folk musician Kate McGarrigle) forced him to perform [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] for guests while growing up, a song he often included in his concert repertoire as an adult.|$|E

Ely {{convinced}} the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response. Unknown to him, he changed the beat from 1-2-3-4, 1–2, 1-2-3-4, 1–2 to 1-2-3, 1–2, 1-2-3, 1–2 because he based it on the intro only. Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes. Dubbed [...] "The Chase", the Kingsmen became the club's house band and Ken Chase became the band's manager. Ely was begging Chase to let the band record {{their own version of}} [...] "Louie Louie", and on April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day. The band had just played a 90-minute [...] "Louie Louie" [...] marathon.|$|E

500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same clothes. I suspect that Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can have that kind of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos {{to become}} an {{associate}} professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. [...] In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of encephalitis, which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. [...] During his recuperation, many friends visited, including Nicholas Metropolis from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician Paul Erdős, who remarked: [...] "Stan, you are just like before." [...] This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. [...] Another friend, Gian-Carlo Rota, asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and biology; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation.

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to building a}} legal career, and {{becoming one of the}} most successful legal professionals of the 1870s, Fleva created a trademark and highly unconventional political style.

He notoriously organized electoral National Liberal rallies in front of patriotic landmarks, such as the Michael the Brave Monument in University Square. With time, Fleva became known to his supporters as Tribunul, [...] "the Tribune", or variations of that nickname. Writing in 2011, journalist Maria Apostol called him [...] "one of the most controversial political figures in the history of Romania."
