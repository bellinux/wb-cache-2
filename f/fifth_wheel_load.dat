The M35 and M211 series <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> rating was 12,000 lb on road and 7,000 lb off-road. A 36,000 lb trailer could be towed on road and a 17,000 lb one off.|$|E
50|$|All had a front winch, {{the fifth}} wheel {{replaced}} the rear winch. As a wrecker the boom could lift up to 20,000 lb, {{and had a}} longer reach than the M816. As a tractor the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> rating was 15,000 lb. Because of the high empty weight as a semi tractor, oversize 12.00x20 tires were used, {{this was the only}} model to have this size.|$|E
50|$|The M246, with {{an extra}} long wheelbase, was a wrecker with a fifth wheel mounted behind the boom. This let the truck perform wrecker duties and to load and tow semi trailers. All had a front and rear winch. Oversize 12.00×20 were used, {{this was the only}} model to have this size. As a wrecker the boom could support 12,000 lb, as a tractor the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> rating was 15,000 lb.|$|E
25|$|The M1000 has 40 wheels (215/75R 17.5 tires) across five axle lines, {{these with}} two {{half-width}} axles per line. Each axle has hydraulic pendular suspension providing a 254mm stroke with lateral oscillation accommodating surface undulations. A hydraulic suspension system is also provided on the pivoting gooseneck to equalise <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> Weight of the M1000 is 22,882kg. Payload {{according to the}} U.S. Army is 63,560kg, although the manufacturer quotes 80,000kg at reduced speeds. Overall length is 15.8 m, deck length is 10.58 m; deck width is 3.05 m, 3.66 m for a wide deck version.|$|R
50|$|With a semi-trailer, ballast {{is added}} {{in the form of}} the weight of the {{attached}} trailer pressing down upon the tractor's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel.</b> Since the <b>load</b> is separate from a ballast tractor, it provides no ballast: the drawbar only transmits a horizontal force.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> were {{originally}} {{not a complete}} circle and were hand forged.

There were a number of patents awarded for fifth-wheel design. Edward and Charles Everett, Quincy, Illinois patented a type of <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1850, followed by Gutches' metallic head block and <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1870 and Wilcox <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1905.|$|R
40|$|Movers Limited) Tatra 815 VVNC 8 X 8 is a 4 {{axle wheel}} drive vehicle i. e. all the 8 half axles are {{independently}} driven continuously. This chassis is considered suitable for variety of special defence {{projects such as}} 30 m telescopic mobile mast, 15 m mechanical bridge carrying of special radars etc. The standard chassis’s is fitted with 15. 00 x 21, 12 PR(Ply Rating) tires are designed for the carrying superstructure payload(PL) up to 15, 000 kg’s (maximum), and the un-laden weight of chassis’s is about 13, 000 kg. The gross vehicle weight (GVW) inclusive of payload (PL) is 28, 000 kg. The distribution of gross vehicle weight (GVW) {{on the front and}} rear tandem axles is as follows; Front axle weight = 2 x 6, 500 kg Rear axle weight = 2 x 7, 500 kg Gross vehicle weight = 28, 000 kg In one of the special project this chassis being used for towing of 40 tonnes semi- trailer. In this application the distribution of <b>Fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> (FWL) on the front and rear tandem axle is estimated as under; Front axle weight = 2 x 6, 750 kg Rear axle weight = 2 x 9, 750 kg Gross vehicle weight = 33, 000 kg By comparison of distribution of weights in the above two cases, it is observed that, there are increase load of 500 kg on front axles and 4, 500 kg on rear tandem axles and increase of 5, 000 kg payload on the chassis. Therefore, carrying this paper work we can increase the PL carrying capacity of BEML TATRA VVNC 8 x 8 by 5, 000 kg.

5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> for motorized trucks is often credited to US inventor Charles H. Martin of the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> Co. who invented the device in 1915. [...] It was submitted for patent in 1915, and finalized in 1916. Herman Farr invented it, and Martin hooked up with him and became the assignee. When they formed the Martin <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> company Martin was president and Farr was named secretary. The 5th wheel was Farr's invention. Martin capitalized on it. [...] "It's a fair question whether you really can consider the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> as a milestone separate from the semi-trailer. After all, {{the purpose of the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> is to link the tractor and the trailer; indeed, trailers existed before Charles H. Martin introduced the Martin Rocking <b>Fifth</b> <b>Wheel</b> in 1915. At the time, the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> literally was a wheel that moved with the trailer—unlike today’s technology that secures a kingpin. What makes the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> so important is the ability it gave fleet owners to attach large trailers to tractors easily and safely and the freedom it gave them to switch out trailers. Without a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel,</b> the modern distribution system would look quite different as drop-and-hook would not be easy. The semi-trailer increased the capacity of trucks, but it was the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> that brought the flexibility for drivers to keep moving while receivers unloaded the loads they just delivered." ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> {{coupling}} {{provides a}} pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> configuration, requiring the coupling {{to be installed}} {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|R

50|$|Increase in <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> has {{important}} implications for the rail infrastructure needed to accommodate future grain hopper car shipments. The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> As <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to handle prolonged rail traffic decreases. Moreover, the ability of a given bridge to handle prolonged rail traffic also decreases as <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> increase.|$|R
50|$|The {{two types}} of {{couplings}} are <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> coupling and automatic. In some applications, no separable coupling is fitted, and the trailer is bolted to the tractor unit, using a bearing, and rocker feet as are used under a <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> skid plate.|$|R
50|$|Today's <b>fifth</b> <b>wheels</b> {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} <b>fifth</b> <b>wheel</b> and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the king pin into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used.

The highest values of contact length and width and tire deflection occurred at the highest <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> and lowest tire inflation pressure. Contact patch width is a polynomial (order 2) function of <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> while there is a linear relationship between tire contact length and <b>wheel</b> <b>load</b> as well as between tire deflection and <b>wheel</b> <b>load.</b> Correlations were developed for the evaluation of contact patch length-rolling resistance, contact patch width-rolling resistance and tire deflection-rolling resistance.
