5|$|Always a tomboy, James quickly {{developed}} {{an interest in}} sports. Her godfather gave her a baseball bat and glove to celebrate her first holy communion. She excelled at hockey, baseball and synchronized swimming as a young child. Her mother wanted her to focus on swimming {{due to the lack}} of opportunities for girls in hockey in the 1970s. Her passion was for hockey, however, and she was constantly playing ball hockey with the neighbourhood boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> she was in kindergarten.

5|$|Another {{controversial}} issue during Desha's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley, president of Transylvania University. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Holley assumed {{the post of}} president in 1818, the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well-qualified and well-respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, Daniel Drake, Charles Caldwell, William T.

Many called Holley an infidel and charged {{that he was a}} drinker and a gambler. He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues.|$|E

In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.

5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Aldfrith's death.|$|E

5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives‚Äì both broad and standard‚Äì were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E
