This situation came to an end in 1949 when the Republic of Ireland Act came into force, removing the King's role in foreign affairs and making the President of Ireland de jure head of state, a new status celebrated by President Seán T. O'Kelly by paying the first ever state visit by an Irish president abroad.|$|E
5000|$|The O'Shannon {{model of}} humor (OMOH) was {{introduced}} by Dan O'Shannon in [...] "What Are You Laughing At? A Comprehensive Guide to the Comedic Event", published in 2012. [...] The model integrates all the general branches of comedy into a unified framework. This framework consists of four main sections: context, information, aspects of awareness, and enhancers/inhibitors. Elements of context are in play as reception factors prior to the encounter with comedic information. This information will require a level of cognitive process to interpret, and contain a degree of incongruity (based on predictive likelihood). That degree may be high, or go as low as to be negligible. The information will be seen simultaneously through several aspects of awareness (the comedy’s internal reality, its <b>external</b> <b>role</b> as humor, its effect on its context, effect on other receivers, etc.). Any element from any of these sections may trigger enhancers / inhibitors (feelings of superiority, relief, aggression, identification, shock, etc.) which {{will have an impact}} on the receiver’s ultimate response. The various interactions of the model allow for a wide range of comedy; for example, a joke needn’t rely on high levels of incongruity if it triggers feelings of superiority, aggression, relief, or identification. Also, high incongruity humor may trigger a visceral response, while well-constructed word-play with low incongruity might trigger a more appreciative response. Also included in the book: evolutionary theories that account for visceral and social laughter, and the phenomenon of comedic entropy.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 227 - 231) Microfiche. x, 231 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmIn this dissertation four Japanese constructions-the passive, the spontaneous, the honorific, and the potential-are examined. My goal is {{to provide}} a unified account of the syntactic function of the suffixes used in these constructions, which have phonetically similar forms and which are said to have arisen from a common source. I argue that the suffixes in question all downgrade the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> of the base verb, i. e., they prevent its association with the syntactically prominent specifier of IP position. In the case of passives, the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> of the base verb remains within the verbal projection, where it is realized as a postpositional phrase and hence does not get associated with the specifier of IP. In the case of the spontaneous, the suffix simply deletes the <b>external</b> <b>role,</b> thereby preventing it being realized in the specifier position. In the case of the subject honorific, the suffix prevents the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> from moving into the syntactically prominent specifer of IP position, so that the argument remains within the verbal projection. Finally, 10 the case of the potential, the suffix suppresses the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> through coindexing with another coreferential argument of the base verb, thereby preventing its realization...|$|E

This {{report is}} written {{based on the}} {{observation}} conducted by the writer in LTI Surakarta by doing her job training. The purpose of this final project is to describe the roles of Public Relations Division in LTI Surakarta. The roles of Public relations division in LTI Surakarta are divided into two categories. They are: (1) the internal, and (2) the <b>external</b> <b>roles.</b> The writer did some jobs with the Manager Marketing of LTI Surakarta by helping the Manager Marketing to finish his job like did the lobbying and solving complaints to gain the informations reported nin this report. The internal roles are the roles conducted by Public Relations Division to increase the performance of company by conducting their plans. The internal programs of Public Relations of LTI Surakarta are addressed to the internal public; they are officers including the public relations officer. Meanwhile, the <b>external</b> <b>roles</b> are the roles of Public Relations Division to increase the performance of company by conducting the programs addressed to the external publics as stake holders of LTI Surakarta. The external public includes other companies, government and official, press media, and advertising agency. From the discussion, the writer concludes that Public Relations Officer has conducted its roles, either internal or <b>external</b> <b>roles.</b> However, the company’s decision which placed one person to hold double jobs for the Public Relations Officer and Manager Marketing was not really effective because {{both of them had}} different focus. Public Relations tends to create and maintain the relationship and cooperation with public without ignoring the goals of company, while marketing is only focused on the selling of products of the company to get profit.

40|$|The {{administrative}} {{reform of the}} 1990 s aimed at changing both the internal modus operandi of the bureaucracy and also {{the nature of its}} exchange with organizations in its environment. This development, which often—and somewhat incorrectly—is described as a shift from “government ” to “governance”, has potentially far-reaching consequences for the bureaucracy. Also, if we conceive of the bureaucracy as a creature of the state, it is a development which also changes the role of the public administration in democratic governance. The paper will critically review the changing role of the bureaucracy in governance. The somewhat paradoxical argument of the paper is that the changing <b>external</b> <b>role</b> of the bureaucracy makes it not less but more important that the bureaucracy maintains its traditional internal modus operandi. The more fluid and contextual <b>external</b> <b>role</b> of the public administration, the more important it becomes that the public administration upholds values such as equal treatment, transparency and accountability. This is mainly because the public administration remains a keystone of democratic governance. Although the execution of policy may have become more contextual, citizen...|$|E

On the legislative front, the Presidency achieved its ambitions as far as the Regulation on the CO 2 limitations of light commercial vehicles, the RoHS Directive and the Biocide Regulation are concerned. However, the decision-making process on the WEEE Directive did not result in an agreement, but these dynamics seemed {{to be out of the}} Presidency’s control. At the front of the non-legislative issues, the Presidency succeeded in reaching Council conclusions on its two priorities: sustainable materials management and better instruments for environmental governance. Second, the Presidency’s <b>external</b> <b>role</b> relates to its responsibility of guiding the EU through the international climate change conference in Cancún and the international negotiations on biodiversity in Nagoya. It successfully managed to bring both the internal coordination and the external representation to a good end.

40|$|Latin deponents {{are usually}} treated as {{morphological}} idiosyncrasies {{in which the}} Middle morphology {{is not related to}} an anticausative (change of state), reflexive or passive syntactic structure, in which it would be expected and grammatically justified (Embick, David. 2000.

(eds.), Deponency and morphological mismatches, 127 – 144. Oxford: Oxford University Press). Focusing on the non-denominal deponents, I show that these verbs are always reflexives or anticausatives. In the reflexive and anticausative structures a single argument gains two thematic roles, the most external one, doer for the reflexives, undergoer for the anticausatives, and a lower one (holder of a state, benefactive, etc.). The Latin Middle morphology marks the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> as syntactically deactivated but semantically existential and allows for the assignment of the <b>external</b> <b>role</b> to a lower argument. The peculiarity of deponents is not the presence of the Middle, but the fact that, because of specific lexical constraints, these verbs cannot be present in an Active derivation. Similar lexically constrained verbs which can only appear in anticausative or reflexive structures are crosslinguistically attested: deponents are not Latin idiosyncrasies...|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} the {{contemporary}} activities and roles that scientific associations play in science and society. It {{is based on a}} comprehensive study of scientific associations in Portugal, relying on a multi-method, quantitative and qualitative approach. After a brief review of the (scarce) literature on associations in the social studies of science, we provide an outline of the expanding field of scientific associations in Portugal.

We conclude that the <b>external</b> <b>roles</b> of associations (establishing connections between science and society) have become more important than the internal ones. Whereas the internationalisation of science has moved the communication, collaboration and competition between researchers into the transnational sphere, the links that associations forge between science and other social spheres are still deeply rooted in national settings and much dependant on specific configurations and practices by government, business and other social actors...|$|R

In-depth interviews with ten young professional women revealed that they actively draw on role models from different domains.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that {{an interpretation of}} competition solely {{as a means to}} increase consumer welfare eliminates substantial characteristics from competition as a process, depriving competition from its original meaning. It is misleading to define competition by evaluating its <b>external</b> <b>role</b> on the economy. This role is important only from the perspective of performance.

Some forms of competition are good or beneficial others are considered as harmful or undesirable, but in both cases we talk about different features of the same phenomenon. The idea that ‘competition has to bring positive outcomes for economy, otherwise it is not competition’ is logically incorrect. It is impossible to qualify the essence of object only by exploring its external effects. The paper concludes that competition itself deserves its protection even in circumstances when it does not lead to efficiency gains. In this respect competition {{can be seen as a}} ‘luxury product’ of market-oriented societies, which is not indispensable for achieving such values as industrial growth, market integration, social coherency, consumer welfare or innovations...|$|E

However, unlike other null-subject constructions, such sentences may contain Principle A reflexives and agent-oriented adverbials leading Holmberg (2005) {{to argue for}} a null generic pronoun, unable to satisfy the EPP for lack of phonetic content.

Distributional evidence is examined suggesting that in the generic subject construction it is not and that the Finnish null subject, like its counterpart in classical null-subject languages, is a specific pronoun.
