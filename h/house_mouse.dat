5|$|The Noronha skink {{probably}} lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha {{was discovered}} by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis). These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island. The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the <b>house</b> <b>mouse,</b> may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> known as the St Kilda <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but did not do so before the 1930 evacuation.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{on island}} populations of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> (Mus domesticus) and their viruses reveal {{insights}} into viral persistence in isolated communities. We surveyed the ectoparasites, endoparasites, and antiviral antibodies for 11 murine viruses and two bacteria of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> inhabiting two islands off Australia. <b>House</b> <b>mice</b> on Boullanger Island were seropositive to two viruses, murine cytomegalovirus and epizootic diarrhea of infant mice. On subantarctic Macquarie Island, <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> were seropositive for five viruses: murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse parvovirus, epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. The diversity of antiviral antibodies was lower among populations of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> on islands than those inhabiting mainland Australia. The decreased diversity of viruses in island populations of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> {{may be a}} function of which agent the founder mice transfer to the island and related to the low densities which the host population may periodically reach over time...|$|R

50|$|<b>House</b> <b>mice</b> are {{not usually}} a vector of human plague (bubonic plague) because they have fewer infestations with fleas than do rats, and because the fleas which <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> {{normally}} carry exhibit little tendency to bite humans rather than their natural host.|$|R
5|$|Rodents {{have been}} used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as {{laboratory}} animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat, the black rat, and the <b>house</b> <b>mouse,</b> are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive, and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.|$|E
5|$|The river, and its tributaries, had a {{population}} of water rats (Hydromys chrysogaster) and Australian swamp rats (Rattus lutreolus). Water rats remain in reduced numbers, but the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus) and brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) have largely supplanted the natives. The <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus) is now the most common mammal of the Torrens environ.|$|E

40|$|Little data {{is known}} about the {{prevalence}} of Salmonella spp. and ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria in <b>house</b> <b>mice,</b> therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria in <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> which were caught in the city of Utrecht. With the results, an attempt was made to give an indication of the public health risks related to the presence of Salmonella spp. and ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria in <b>house</b> <b>mice.</b> Between September and December of 2015, <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> were acquired in co-operation with households and the university pest control contractor (Rentokil). Faecal samples were investigated for the presence of Salmonella spp. and ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was used to determine ESBL/AmpC-phenotype. Faecal samples of 26 <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> were included in this study. None (0 %) of the tested faecal samples were positive for the presence of Salmonella spp. and one (3. 8 %) of the samples tested positive for the presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing bacteria (Enterobacter suspected). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that it concerned an AmpC-phenotype, but this has to be confirmed by means of PCR at a later time...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} wild mammalians {{may be found}} in Canadian {{territory}} without being confirmed natives. Some were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced. These include the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus), and Norway and black rats (respectively Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Other include escaped animals; the Coypu (Myocastor coypus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as feral cats, dogs and horses fall into this category. Fallow deers (Dama dama) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) were introduced for hunting.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> are two of only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, of which there are three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
40|$|Salmonellae were {{isolated}} from the faeces from 17 of 170 (10 %) wild <b>house</b> <b>mice.</b> Salmonella typhimurium was isolated from 10, S. typhimurium, var. Copenhagen from 2, S. thompson from 1, and S. muenchen from 4. It was concluded that <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> could be a reservoir of infection and {{play an important role}} in huma. n and animal salmonellosis. Salmonellosis in animals and man has become a world-wide problem. Each host species may be a source of infection to another. The public health significance of salmonella-infected <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> is apparent: they have been regarded as possible vectors of. human and animal salmonellosis owing to their indiscriminate feeding on sanitary wastes and human and animal food. This suspicion has been strengthened by reports of natural isolations of pathogens from <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> found in human and animal environmen...|$|R

5|$|The black currawong consumes {{the berries}} of the heath species Leptecophylla juniperina, and Astroloma humifusum, {{and the native}} sedge Gahnia grandis, as well as {{domestic}} pea, and apples. Invertebrates consumed include earthworms (Lumbricidae) and many types of insects, such as ants, moths, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and beetles like weevils, scarabs and leaf beetles. It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp (Vespula germanica). A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (Petroica boodang) was seen to suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, Tasmanian nativehen (Gallinula mortierii), flame robin (Petroica phoenicea) and rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildlife}} on Ford Island {{is likely}} {{very similar to}} that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor. Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the <b>house</b> <b>mouse,</b> mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, Java sparrow and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including mullet, milkfish and Hawaiian anchovy. The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E

40|$|Estimates of body {{condition}} in mammals may be constructed from measures of skeletal size and body mass.

Indices of condition for individual <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> were not correlated with the fat content of their carcasses. Indices of condition for <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> have a relatively low repeatability because of variation from day to day in body mass and because of variation in length measurements taken by different observers. Bias in measurements among observers must be eliminated to make indices of condition from live animals useful...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maternal}} environment on intermale aggression was studied by means of embryo transfer of genetically selected aggressive (SAL) and nonaggressive wild <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> (LAL), and their reciprocal F 1 's, to standard (NMRI) females.

Since previous studies on wild <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> failed to demonstrate postnatal effects on aggression, and the present results indicate the absence of prenatal maternal environmental effects on aggression, the primacy of genetic over maternal variance in the development of adult intermale aggression in wild <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> is indicated. ...|$|R
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} <b>house</b> <b>mouse,</b> it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground {{and would not be}} expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E

5|$|Rodents {{are used}} widely as model organisms in animal testing. Albino mutant rats were first used for {{research}} in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes. Nowadays, the <b>house</b> <b>mouse</b> is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory rodent, and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide. They are favored because of their small size, fertility, short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans. They are used in research into genetics, developmental biology, cell biology, oncology and immunology. Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century; about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States {{for research in}} the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. In 2007, they constituted about 2% of all laboratory animals. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. They have been launched into orbital space flight several times—first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961, with a successful recovery. The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic; it is used in studies on thermoregulation. It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P, a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain.|$|E

Most of these have not caused much damage, and most have only established in human settlements. R. nitidus and R. argentiventer have very limited distributions on the island.

40|$|General Motors and the A C.

Diaphragms with or without a rodent proof cure formula, which are used by GM, did not influence the gnawing of all test rodent species. Diaphragms with a lubricant (Paricin) were more attractive to gnawing by <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> than diaphragms without a lubricant. Five objects with different texture were used to detect gnawing preference of <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> and 3 objects were used on Peromyscus.

Rubber stoppers were gnawed less than wood blocks and corks by <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> and Peromyscus, but the differences were not significant. Results indicate that the presence of a rigid and protective edge on the diaphragms was a critical factor in attracting rodent gnawing. To test this possibility, diaphragms on servos supported by aluminum piston heads with 3 different beveled edges were presented to captive Peromyscus. The amount of gnawing was not significantly different among the diaphragms supported by the different piston heads. Once the gnawing was initiated, continued gnawing was thought to be dependent on the texture of objects...|$|R

5000|$|The {{polygamous}} {{behavior of}} female <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> promotes sperm competition, which affects {{both male and}} female evolutionary fitness.

Sperm competition that arises from polygamy favors males with faster, more motile sperm in higher numbers, increasing male fitness. The competitive aspect of insemination increases the frequency of polyandrous events and fertilizations. Polyandry has evolved to increase reproductive success. Male mating behavior is also affected in response to the practice of polygamous behavior. Compared to monogamous <b>house</b> <b>mice,</b> polygamous <b>house</b> <b>mice</b> mate for longer periods of time.
