The sheriff forbids anyone from going <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things to find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports {{later in the year}} that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Ph≈ìbus the cardinal.|$|E
5|$|In August 1912 Harriet Monroe hired Pound as {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to Poetry. He submitted his own poems, as well as poems by James Joyce, Robert Frost, D. H. Lawrence, Yeats, H.D. and Aldington, and collected material for a 64-page anthology, Des Imagistes (1914). The Imagist movement began to attract attention from critics. In November 1913 Yeats, whose eyesight was failing, rented Stone Cottage in Coleman's Hatch, Sussex, and invited Pound to accompany him as his secretary. They stayed there for 10 weeks, reading and writing, walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> fencing. It was the first of three winters they spent together at Stone Cottage, including two with Dorothy after she and Pound married on 20 April 1914.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Junior Campers, led by Ernest Borgnine, take the correct route, but {{they end up}} in a much worse position: after finding {{themselves}} trapped in a dark, tangled swamp (while being hunted by mountain men), they are attacked by a bear that Borgnine tries but fails to fight off (due to Homer stealing his Swiss Army Knife), and they finally flee to an abandoned summer camp. At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure lurking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> their fates are left unknown.|$|E

Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E
5|$|As Miraz and {{his army}} arrive at Aslan's How, Caspian {{suggests}} Peter and Miraz duel to the death, with the loser's army to surrender, {{to buy time}} for Lucy and Susan to find Aslan. Miraz agrees to the duel, not wanting {{to look like a}} coward in front of his men. The girls are attacked by Telmarine soldiers, so Susan remains behind to fight them while Lucy continues alone. Peter defeats Miraz, and gives Caspian his sword to finish him off, but Caspian spares Miraz's life. Sopespian kills Miraz with one of Susan's arrows and accuses the Narnians, leading to a battle, with the Telmarines gradually winning. Lucy finds Aslan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> he awakens the trees, turning the battle in the Narnians' favor. Sopespian orders a retreat to a bridge, where they are confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons the river god, who destroys the bridge, killing many of the soldiers, swallowing Sopespian and winning the battle.|$|E

The theme of this thesis is the classification and application of industrial robots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> furniture industry {{as well as the}} analysis of the presence of industrial robots in developed world economies. It is presented the total delivery of industrial robots for the period from the year 2000 to the year 2011. Conducted analysis demonstrates the specifity of the implementation of industrial robots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> furniture industry, <b>in</b> comparison to other branches of industry, in fact, it is evident that the degree of implementation does not directly depend on countrie s technological development and that some countries have recognized their own potential chance for development in this branch of industry. It is noticeable that the trends of robotization are very different compared to <b>the</b> robotization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> furniture industry. This work presents the comparative analysis by continents and regions for the mentioned period of time, both on an annual basis and on the total number of industrial robots delivered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> furniture industry at that time.

5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> <b>and</b> later upon any Confederate artillery that {{attempted to}} move into firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Miller's discography {{as leader}} began to expand again, as Maxjazz started to release {{recordings}}. A series of four concert recordings were released {{over the following}} years: Live at The Kennedy Center Vol. 1 and Live at The Kennedy Center Vol. 2 (recorded in 2002), with Derrick Hodge (bass) and Rodney Green (drums); and Live at Yoshi's Vol. 1 and Live at Yoshi's Vol. 2 (recorded in 2003), with Hodge and Karriem Riggins (drums). In 2002 Miller joined bassist Ron Carter's Golden Striker Trio, with guitarist Russell Malone. The trio occasionally toured internationally for the next decade. In 2003 Miller was commissioned to write a score for the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company; after writing The Clearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> <b>and</b> having it choreographed by Ronald K. Brown, Miller and his band played the piece for performances by the company.|$|E
5|$|The 1530, Herbarum Vivae Eicones of Brunfels {{contained}} the admired botanically accurate original woodcut colour illustrations of Hans Weiditz along with descriptions of 47 species new to science. Bock, in {{setting out to}} describe the plants of his native Germany, produced the New Kreuterbuch of 1539 describing the plants he had found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> fields but without illustration; this was supplemented by a second edition in 1546 that contained 365 woodcuts. Bock was possibly the first to adopt a botanical classification in his herbal which also covered details of ecology and plant communities. In this, he was placing emphasis on botanical rather than medicinal characteristics, unlike the other German herbals and foreshadowing the modern Flora. De Historia Stirpium (1542 with a German version in 1843) of Fuchs was a later publication with 509 high quality woodcuts that again paid close attention to botanical detail: it included many plants introduced to Germany {{in the sixteenth century}} that were new to science. The work of Fuchs is regarded as being among the most accomplished of the Renaissance period.|$|E

5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Peƒáanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Ni≈° in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Peƒáanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Peƒáanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinoviƒá, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Peƒáanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinoviƒá was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January‚Äì February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Peƒáanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Peƒáanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Ni≈° in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Peƒáanac advised his fighters to hide out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> mountains, while Vojinoviƒá ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Peƒáanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> stumbles upon {{a bizarre}} shaft of light. Once Tony {{steps into the}} light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and {{is sent to the}} hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D. Clark), an {{experienced}} big game hunter and tracker from England {{who specializes in}} hunting man-eating tigers. Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger, one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn, she runs back to the car, but the Tiger has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> they discuss the tiger. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E
