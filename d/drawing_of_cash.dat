40|$|In {{the first}} essay, "The Source <b>of</b> <b>Cash</b> and Its Marginal Value," we study the {{relation}} between the source <b>of</b> firms' <b>cash</b> holdings and the value <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> to shareholders. The marginal value of a dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings depends on the source of the dollar: $ 1. 00 <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> has a value of $ 1. 27 when it is from operations, $ 0. 80 when from financing, and $ 0. 46 when from investing. Within the same source, the marginal value of an added dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings is significantly higher than the absolute value of a subtracted dollar. Shareholders of financially constrained or distressed firms value incremental cash holdings from almost any source more highly than do shareholders of unconstrained or stronger firms, but differences in value remain across the sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> within each subsample. Agency costs and information asymmetry are two frictions that appear to have the largest impact upon the value <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> In the second essay, "Explanations for Diverging Values of Cash," we further explain the differing values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> found in the first essay. Intertemporal relationships among the sources and uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide a rational basis for shareholders to assign different values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> based on the source. Sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide information about likely uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> up to two to three years in the future, and many of the intertemporal relations are statistically and economically significant. Likewise, prior uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> relate significantly to later uses <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> Past sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> inform investors about likely future sources, even up to five years into the future. The fact that different kinds <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> flows have predictive power for future cash flows helps explain the wide range of the values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> associated with different sources...|$|R

Data used in this research is financial statement data of manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) in 2001 - 2009.
