25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>ecological</b> <b>monitoring</b> of kelp forests before, during, and after such disturbances, scientists try to tease apart {{the intricacies of}} kelp forest dynamics using experimental manipulations. By working on smaller spatial-temporal scales, they can control for {{the presence or absence}} of specific biotic and abiotic factors to discover the operative mechanisms. For example, in southern Australia, manipulations of kelp canopy types demonstrated that the relative amount of Ecklonia radiata in a canopy could be used to predict understory species assemblages; consequently, the proportion of E. radiata can be used as an indicator of other species occurring in the environment.|$|E
