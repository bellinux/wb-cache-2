2500|$|Green roofs can be {{categorized}} as intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium {{and the amount of}} maintenance they need. Extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot (50–120kg/m2) while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot (390–730kg/m2). Traditional roof gardens, which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns, are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive, requiring irrigation, feeding, and other maintenance. [...] Intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from <b>kitchen</b> <b>herbs</b> to shrubs and small trees. [...] Extensive green roofs, by contrast, are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance, perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth. [...] Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance. [...] They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of rockwool laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of Sedum species and mosses. [...] Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a waterproofing membrane is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.|$|E
6000|$|On parting {{with the}} old angler I inquired after his place of abode, and, {{happening}} {{to be in the}} neighborhood of the village a few evenings afterwards, I had the curiosity to seek him out. I found him living in a small cottage containing only one room, but a perfect curiosity in its method and arrangement. It was on the skirts of the village, on a green bank a little back from the road, with a small garden in front stocked with <b>kitchen</b> <b>herbs</b> and adorned with a few flowers. The whole front of the cottage was overrun with a honeysuckle. On the top was a ship for a weathercock. The interior was fitted up in a truly nautical style, his ideas of comfort and convenience having been acquired on the berth-deck of a man-of-war. A hammock was slung from the ceiling which in the daytime was lashed up so as to take but little room. From the centre of the chamber hung a model of a ship, of his own workmanship. Two or three chairs, a table, and a large sea-chest formed the principal movables. About the wall were stuck up naval ballads, such as [...] "Admiral Hosier's Ghost," [...] "All in the Downs," [...] and [...] "Tom Bowling," [...] intermingled with pictures of sea-fights, among which the battle of Camperdown held a distinguished place. The mantelpiece was decorated with sea-shells, over which hung a quadrant, flanked by two wood-cuts of most bitter-looking naval commanders. His implements for angling were carefully disposed on nails and hooks about the room. On a shelf was arranged his library, containing a work on angling, much worn, a Bible covered with canvas, an odd volume or two of voyages, a nautical almanac, and a book of songs.|$|E

50|$|In the Japanese cuisine, chefs {{often use}} {{shellfish}} and their roe in different dishes. Sushi (vinegared rice, topped with other ingredients, including shellfish, fish, meat and vegetables) features both raw and cooked shellfish. Sashimi primarily consists of very fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces. Both sushi and sashimi are served with {{soy sauce and}} wasabi paste (a Japanese horseradish root, a spice with extremely strong, hot flavor), thinly sliced pickled ginger root, and a simple garnish such as shiso (a <b>kitchen</b> <b>herb,</b> member of the mint family) or finely shredded daikon radish, or both.|$|R

40|$|Salvia divinorum is a hallucinogenic herb {{from the}} mint family, Lamiaceae. An {{estimated}} 1. 8 million {{people over the}} age of 12 have used S. divinorum in their lifetime as of 2008. The abuse of S. divinorum is attractive to teens and young adults who wish to experiment with psychoactive materials. The plant material and extracts are widely available via the Internet, and it is known that S. divinorum will not show up on common drug screens. The active component in S. divinorum is salvinorin A, which is a non-nitrogenous diterpene that is a highly selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist, reported to be the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen. Since salvinorin A is such a selective and potent agonist of the KOR, there is interest in researching analogues in efforts to develop and understand therapeutic drugs for depression, schizophrenia, and other mental illnesses, resulting in the discovery of analogues with increased potency. These semi-synthetic salvinorin analogues have been abused by spraying the drug on innocuous plant material or on cigarette papers as a substrate for smoking. This practice poses a significant health risk, as most new analogues will have little safety and toxicity data associated with common abuse routes. Chemical characterization of the potent analogue, salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether (SB-EME) was performed in order to develop methods of differentiation from Salvia divinorum and salvinorin A. These characterization techniques include HPLC, UV/Vis, NMR, and a colorimetric assay with Ehrlich's reagent. Adulteration of other plant materials with salvinorin A and analogues was performed and analyzed to determine if fortified materials can be detected by colorimetric assay. The validation studies of the HPLC method for SB-EME were found to be accurate (%RE < 12 %), precise (RSD = 12 %), and linear (R 2 = 0. 9993) over the mass range of 0. 038 µg - 4. 8 µg. The LOD was determined to be 0. 038 µg, and the LOQ was determined to be 0. 113 µg. Significant matrix effects were observed when using Salvia officinalis as a blank matrix, affecting the accuracy and selectivity of the method. However, the purified solutions of SB-EME had baseline resolution from salvinorin A and salvinorin B, which allows for easy qualitative distinction if adulterated samples are suspected. UV/Vis analysis provided a rapid and facile SB-EME characterization method. The UV/Vis trace for SB-EME was distinguishable from both salvinorin A and salvinorin B. NMR analysis confirmed the structures of salvinorin A, salvinorin B and SB-EME, with resonances specific to each compound. The colorimetric assay with Ehrlich's reagent provided a red-orange result with salvinorin B and SB-EME, similar to salvinorin A. While this does not provide differentiation in the field, it does allow all materials related to Salvia divinorum to be identified and collected for further analysis in the lab, as this colorimetric analysis allows easy distinction from common <b>kitchen</b> <b>herbs</b> such as mint, basil, and sage. Characterization of the colored species in the assay with Ehrlich's reagent was performed with UV/Vis, HPLC, and NMR. The UV/Vis analysis showed a new peak at 500 nm in the aqueous layer, which would correspond to a red-orange color. HPLC analysis revealed a new, highly retained peak from the DCM layer of the assay. 1 H NMR analysis indicated that the backbone of the salvinorins was not stable in acid, and the molecule that creates the color was likely a degraded analogue. The analysis of the adulterated plant materials by colorimetric assay was inconclusive, as color intensity decreased as concentration of spiked standard increased. HPLC analysis of the vial remnants after the colorimetric assay confirm recoveries of the spiking compounds up to an average of 22 % for salvinorin A, 96 % for salvinorin B, and 41 % for SB-EME over all matrices, indicating incomplete deposition of standard material onto the plant material. In conclusion, salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether can be detected in the field through the use of Ehrlich's reagent as a colorimetric assay. Further laboratory tests, including HPLC and UV/Vis, were shown to easily distinguish the ether derivative from salvinorin A and B...|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. <b>Kitchen</b> gardens provided <b>herbs,</b> including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|R
