40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{immunization}} status {{of young children}} in a predominantly Hispanic region in and around downtown Los Angeles, and factors associated with complete immunization by age 24 months. METHODS: The information was gathered in a two-stage cluster survey with probability proportionate to estimated size (PPS) sampling of 30 clusters at the first stage, and simple random sampling of a constant number of children at the second stage. Vaccination coverage was determined by {{a review of the}} home immunization (HI) card, or of clinic records. RESULTS: Of the 270 sampled children, 91. 5 % were Hispanic and 6. 7 % were Black. Home telephone numbers were not available in 24. 8 % of the homes, and 34. 1 % reported having no health insurance. Vaccination coverage was over 90 % for the first three doses of Diphtheria, tetanus toxoids and pertussis/ diphtheria, tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTP/DTaP) /Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (DT), first two doses of poliovirus (Polio) vaccine, first dose of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and first two doses of hepatitis B (<b>Hep</b> <b>B)</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Yet, by age 24 months, only 72. 2 % of the children had received the combined series of 4 : 3 : 1 (i. e., four DTP/DTaP/DT, three Polio, one MMR). This was further reduced to 64. 4 % for the combined series of 4 : 3 : 1 : 3 : 3 (i. e., four DTP/DTaP/ DT, three Polio, one MMR, three Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), three Hep B). Factors associated with completed on-time vaccination were having an HI card available during the interview and being enrolled in Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). CONCLUSIONS: While vaccination levels for individual antigens were found to be high, more emphasis needs to be placed on getting preschool children vaccinated on-time according to the Recom...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{parasitic}} {{infections are}} associated with active immunomodulation which may include by-stander effects on unrelated antigens. It {{has been suggested that}} pre-natal exposure to parasitic infections in the mother impacts immunological development in the fetus and hence the offspring's response to vaccines, and that control of parasitic infection among pregnant women will therefore be beneficial. We used new data from the Entebbe Mother and Baby Study, a trial of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy conducted in Uganda, to further investigate this hypothesis. 2705 mothers were investigated for parasitic infections and then randomised to albendazole (400 mg) versus placebo and praziquantel (40 mg/kg) during pregnancy in a factorial design. All mothers received sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine for presumptive treatment of malaria. Offspring received Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines at birth, six, 10 and 14 weeks. New data on antibody levels to diphtheria toxin, three pertussis antigens, Haemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) and Hepatitis B, measured at one year (April 2004 -May 2007) from 1379 infants were analysed for this report. Additional observational analyses relating maternal infections to infant vaccine responses were also conducted. Helminth infections were highly prevalent amongst mothers (hookworm 43. 1 %, Mansonella 20. 9 %, Schistosoma mansoni 17. 3 %, Strongyloides 11. 7 %, Trichuris 8. 1 %) and 9. 4 % had malaria at enrolment. In the trial analysis we found no overall effect of either anthelminthic intervention on the measured infant vaccine responses. In observational analyses, no species was associated with suppressed responses. Strongyloidiasis was associated with enhanced responses to pertussis toxin, HiB and <b>Hep</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> antigens. Our results do not support the hypothesis that routine anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy has a benefit for the infant's vaccine response, or that maternal helminth infection has a net suppressive effect on the offspring's response to vaccines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{major effort}} to {{introduce}} new vaccines into poor {{nations of the}} world was initiated in recent years {{with the help of the}} GAVI alliance. The first vaccines introduced have been the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and the hepatitis <b>B</b> (<b>Hep</b> <b>B)</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The introduction of these vaccines during the first phase of GAVI's operations demonstrated considerable variability. We set out to study the factors affecting the introduction of these vaccines. The African Region (AFRO), where new vaccines were introduced to a substantial number of countries during the first phase of GAVI's funding, was selected for this study. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: GAVI-eligible AFRO countries with a population of 0. 5 million or more were included in the study. Countries were analyzed and compared for new vaccine introduction, healthcare indicators, financial indicators related to healthcare and country-level Governance Indicators, using One Way ANOVA, correlation analysis and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Introduction of new vaccines into AFRO nations was associated primarily with high country-level Governance Indicator scores. The use of individual Governance Indicator scores, as well as a combined Governance Indicator score we developed, demonstrated similar results. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study results indicate that good country-level governance is an imperative pre-requisite for the successful early introduction of new vaccines into poor African nations. Enhanced support measures may be required to effectively introduce new vaccines to countries with low governance scores. The combined governance score we developed may thus constitute a useful tool for helping philanthropic organizations make decisions regarding the type of support needed by different countries to achieve success...|$|R

40|$|The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis C (HCV) – are a {{major health}} concern in prisons, {{evidenced}} {{by the fact that}} prevalence rates tend to be substantially higher among prison populations than in the general population. Prisons and other places of detention are high-risk environments for the transmission of these diseases. This is related to the over-incarceration of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups who carry a disproportionately high burden of disease and ill-health; the criminalisation of drug users and high levels of injecting drug use; overcrowded and substandard prison conditions; inadequate health care; and the denial of harm reduction services. Over the past 20 years, from an Irish perspective, there has been significant improvement in medical services for the prison population. The Irish Prison Service (IPS), responsible for the prisoners and their health, has made significant investment since 1999 in better healthcare facilities for prisoners 1. In 2001 the IPS introduced drug treatment plans and healthcare plans, <b>Hep</b> <b>B</b> <b>vaccine</b> was made accessible to prisoners, nurses were employed, drug free units were expanded, and methadone treatment was implemented. In 2006 the IPS published a drugs policy ‘Keeping drugs out of prison’. However, there still remains a lack of information available that would assist public authorities in making decisions with regards to these services. While some {{progress has been made in}} the adoption of monitoring mechanisms for infectious diseases in Irish prisons, this progress is arguably less than sufficient or consistent in meeting the standards of human rights-based prison monitoring. As has been acknowledged above, the absence of adequate medical services in prisons can contribute to, or even constitute, conditions that meet the threshold of ill treatment. Presently, to our knowledge, inspection of infectious diseases is not formally included in the criteria for inspection of places of detention. Prison monitoring is often separated from health care inspection guidelines, thus leaving gapsin terms of coherent recording and monitoring. This separation is less than optimal in terms of services being positioned to provide an effective and coherent national response to prisoner need. This report is part of a larger international project that seeks to address this gap...|$|E

MethodsThis was a randomized, phase III, observer-blind study in Thai infants (N= 412), who received DTaP–IPV–Hep B–PRP-T or DTaP–IPV–Hep B//PRP-T at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, co-administered with PCV 7. All received <b>Hep</b> <b>B</b> at birth. Non-inferiority for <b>Hep</b> <b>B</b> ≥ 10 mIU/ml and PRP ≥ 0. 15 μg/ml was analyzed (DTaP–IPV–Hep B–PRP-T relative to DTaP–IPV–Hep B//PRP-T) at 1 month post-primary. Seroprotection/seroconversion and geometric mean titers (GMTs) were analyzed descriptively for all hexavalent components. Safety was evaluated from parental reports. ResultsAnti-Hep B and anti-PRP antibody seroprotection rates were high for DTaP–IPV–Hep B–PRP-T (n= 189) and DTaP–IPV–Hep B//PRP-T (n= 190), and non-inferiority was demonstrated. Anti-D and anti-T ≥ 0. 01 IU/ml, anti-polio types 1, 2, and 3 ≥ 8 (1 /dil), and anti-PT and anti-FHA seroconversion were high and similar in each group. For DTaP–IPV–Hep B–PRP-T and DTaP–IPV–Hep B//PRP-T, anti-Hep B ≥ 100 mIU/ml was 98. 4 % and 99. 5 % (GMTs 2477 and 2442 mIU/ml), respectively; anti-PRP ≥ 1. 0 μg/ml was 85. 2 % and 71. 1 % (GMTs 5. 07 and 2. 41 μg/ml), respectively.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{protein kinase}} C (PKC) has been implicated as an {{effector}} of erythropoietin (EPO) production, its exact role is still uncertain. <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> human hepatocellular carcinoma cells {{were used for}} this study and were depleted of PKC in three different ways: long-term treatment with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), selective inhibition with calphostin C, and treatment with PKCα antisense oligonucleotides. When EPO-producing <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells were incubated in 1 % O 2 (hypoxia) for 24 h, PMA treatment resulted in significant decreases in medium levels of EPO in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cell cultures at concentrations higher than 10 nM. The specific PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, significantly inhibited medium levels of EPO and EPO mRNA levels in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells exposed to 1 % O 2. Western blot analysis revealed that <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells express the classical PKCα and γ isoforms, as well as novel PKCϵ and δ and the atypical ζ isoform. Preincubation with PMA for 6 h specifically down-regulated PKCα protein expression. Phosphorothioate modified antisense oligonucleotides specific for PKCα also decreased EPO production in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells exposed to hypoxia for 20 h when compared to PKCα sense treatment. The translocation of PKCα from the soluble to particulate fractions was increased in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells incubated under hypoxia compared with normoxia (21 % O 2) controls.

So far, investigations of oxygen-regulated erythropoietin (EPO) gene expression in the human hepatoma cell lines <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HepG 2 allowed many important insights into the mechanisms of oxygen-sensing, signalling and regulation of an increasing number of oxygen-responsive genes. To differentiate the various signalling pathways involved in EPO production by these two cell lines, we examined several factors that positively influenced EPO expression. The results demonstrate a keen differential effect of cell density and oxygen concentration on EPO induction in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> compared to HepG 2 cells. Using optimized cell culture conditions, EPO production rates as high as 1 U EPO per 106 <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells in 24 h could be achieved.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the most}} common hepatic tumor worldwide and is a major cause of death in many countries. Although chronic viral infections and hepatotoxic agents are the major risk factors, the molecular pathogenesis of HCC remains largely unknown. Among model mice, TGFα/c-Myc transgenic mice develop human HCC-like tumors. Whole genome sequencing of HCC tumors from patients has shown that mutations to CTNNB 1 (β-catenin) are the most frequent (15. 9 %). So in this study, we characterized the effects of TGFα, c-MYC and mutant CTNNB 1 genes on the transplantable <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells. TGFα increased the tumor number after transplanting <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells. Mutant CTNNB 1 changed the characteristics of <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> tumor cells into a disarranged structure with loose cell-cell contacts. And co-transduction of TGFα and mutant CTNNB 1 synergistically increased the growth rate, size and weight of <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> tumors. Unexpectedly, c-MYC overexpression in the <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> cells induced apoptosis. Interestingly, TGFα+mutant CTNNB 1 +MYC-transduced cells grew very slowly and the tumor showed transdifferentiation into a cholangial duct. These results suggest that the interaction of these three genes determines the characteristics of <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> tumor.

HcGIP 1 cDNA hybridized strongly with poly(A) + RNA species from HepG 2 and <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B.</b> Both HcGIPI and HcGIP 2 mRNAs were expressed in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HuH 7 cells. The nucleotide sequence of an ∼ 300 -bp cDNA fragment, isolated after RT-PCR cloning from HepG 2 RNA, was identical to a sequence within the conserved domain of HcGIP 1 cDNA, {{consistent with the}} presence of HcGIPI mRNA in HepG 2 cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{enhancer sequence}} {{has recently been}} demonstrated in the hepatitis B viral genome. This enhancer sequence {{has also been shown}} to increase the activity of HBcAg gene promoter. Using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression system, we demonstrated that the intrinsic promoter activity of HBsAg gene promoter was stronger than that of HBcAg gene promoter in both human hepatoma cell lines, <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HuH- 7. Furthermore, we showed that the HBV enhancer sequence not only stimulated the HBcAg gene promoter activity, but also stimulated the HBsAg gene promoter activity in both <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HuH- 7 cells. The enhancer sequence increased the HBsAg gene promoter activity 20 -fold in both <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HuH- 7 cell lines, while the increase of the HBcAg gene promoter was 2 - and 8 -fold in <b>Hep</b> 3 <b>B</b> and HuH- 7 cells, respectively...|$|R
