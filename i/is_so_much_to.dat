500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do right where he is.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a largely {{positive}} review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the conceit {{and called the}} episode [...] "the scariest [...] of the year". She applauded the [...] "now you see it, now you don't" [...] appearance of the bug creature and noted that Pincus' casting was [...] "just right". She concluded that the episode was [...] "so well realized" [...] and that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> enjoy". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two compared the entry to the previous fifth season installment [...] "Bad Blood", calling [...] "Folie à Deux" [...] its [...] "logical extension". Shearman and Pearson argued that the episode [...] "provide a comedy and an effective monster story at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union's General Assembly newsletters. He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lure of the}} {{countryside}} could prove a distraction to an active boy, who needed to be pulled back into line. Henry Dowes wrote to Cromwell in September 1534 explaining that he had used every effort to advance Gregory in his studies, but “forcause summer was spent {{in the service of}} the wild gods, it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be regarded after what fashion youth is brought up.” However, by April 1535, Dowes was able to report to his father that [...] "his improvement is greater than at any time here before, partly because he is brought into some awe and dread, and is ready to give himself to learning when required, partly because those things which formerly alienated his mind from study are now withdrawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} father wants {{me on the}} farm. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do, you see. While the war was on {{everything}} went to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Gwendolen, {{in a tone}} of assent to the {{interest}} of that expectation. [...] "And there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be seen and done in town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Moses; [...] "at least," [...] he added, {{blushing}} very deeply, [...] "I didn't {{feel like}} reading. I had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do, and there <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We mustn't {{sit here}} too long, there'll <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] said Lady Agnes anxiously, perceiving a certain {{slowness}} {{in the service}} of the boeuf braisé.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> obliged <b>to</b> you," [...] said Rachel. [...] "Oh Lord Castlewell! I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> obliged <b>to</b> you. He {{tells me}} {{in the first place}} that you are a reprobate." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> lament in {{the world}} in which we live," [...] said the younger of the strangers, [...] "that I can spare no pang for the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} so occupied, Adela. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do in taking up a parish. Even though I know all the people so well, {{there has been so}} much to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How she {{sticks to}} him!" [...] said Arabella. [...] "Oh no--I fancy {{they are not}} married, or they wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> one another as that... I wonder!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am," [...] I said, with {{a modest}} {{acquiescence}} in an assertion which I felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> my credit. But I blushed for its untruth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she responded, [...] "it's delightful! And everybody's so energetic! You {{move with}} a spring and verve; and I don't hear any grumbling, though there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am tired, but it isn't that. It {{seems that}} there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> think about. I'll tell you {{everything}} to-morrow, when I get quiet again. Not {{that there is much}} to tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} I envy any one {{so much in}} life," [...] he proceeded, [...] "as coming to Monte Carlo for {{the first or second}} time. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> know, to see, to understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said, governor!" [...] cried Tom, with beaming face. [...] "Now, that {{is exactly}} my own feeling, but there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be explained. Why have they left London, and where have they gone to?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{pass over}} those three months. I tried hard for Harry and Polly's sake to keep up, and as there <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{do with his}} outfit and her trousseau, I succeeded pretty well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> happy; I should indeed. There's nothing I {{should like}} <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> make myself useful in some way.

6000|$|Mr. Poole's Annotations has the {{following}} remarks on these lines; which, I think, <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{that part of}} my case which is to follow, that I do not omit them. The words are these:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I not reasonable? Do I not think? But there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> think of!" [...] she sighed. [...] "You carried your {{deception}} so far. You came here, for instance, as Monsieur de Lesperon. Why that duplicity?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you knew}} I loved you, though {{in those days}} I dare not tell you so? I have done so, I think, from the night I first saw you, and yet there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> make you shrink from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] {{he replied}} gravely, [...] "it {{will be out}} of the {{question}} for me to stay just now. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do at the cañon; and I think you know why I am so anxious to carry the work through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] said Olive, [...] "not always. I {{remember}} a child {{you did not}} care for, on whom you did not even look, who was absolutely nothing to you, although you <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R
60|$|David applauded vigorously; but Mr. Power rose silently, looking both {{touched and}} surprised; and, drawing Christie's {{hand through his}} arm, led her away into the garden {{for one of the}} quiet talks that <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, no one <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> blame as I. I {{will trust}} no living {{creature}} again. My carelessness {{opened the way}} to temptation, and Heaven knows, Lucilla, I have been infinitely more displeased with myself than with them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity we have {{to sleep}} when there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> see," [...] was Dave's comment, as, after having passed through Cincinnati, it grew time to retire. [...] "I'd like very much to see what {{this section of the}} country looks like." ...|$|E
6000|$|In seeking for {{information}} about the teraphim, I lighted upon the following passage in the valuable article on that subject by Archdeacon Farrar, in Kitto's Cyclopædia of Biblical Literature, which <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the purpose of my argument, that I venture to quote it in full:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate to do it," [...] said Billings. [...] "They {{have been}} fine to me. Jor and Tan are splendid men {{and they will}} think me an ingrate; but I can't waste my life here when there <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{be done in the}} outer world." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{lingered in}} the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in Eden must have been, crept over it. There <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> talk over and recall--things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood.|$|R
60|$|Her {{soul was}} evidently {{with them and}} with her charges, of whom there <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say, that the {{carriage}} came all too soon to hurry Albinia away from the sight of that buoyant sweetness and capacity of happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "A sail," [...] said Davids, {{peering out}} over the sea but able to see nothing. Lucilla and Dickory did not cease talking. At that moment Lucilla did not care greatly about sails, there <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said about Barbadoes.|$|R
