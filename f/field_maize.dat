Two hybrids of each zone were considered. Three experiments were carried out under growth chamber and glasshouse conditions. Corn response to rimsulfuron doses was linear. Hybrids of zone 1 were more tolerant to rimsulfuron than hybrids from zones 2 and zone 3. Dry weight reduction of hybrids (DWR {{as a percentage of the}} untreated control 14 days after treatment) varied according to the dose from 22 % to 29 %, 31 % to 35 %, and 36 % to 38 % in zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
