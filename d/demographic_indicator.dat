50|$|By {{the age of}} 15, most Savanna and River Pumé {{girls are}} married. Boys also marry young, but the early {{marriage}} of Pumé girls is particularly important as a <b>demographic</b> <b>indicator</b> of relatively rapid maturation in response to living in an environment with low food availability, high disease exposure, and potentially high risks of mortality. Pumé girls work less than girls in comparable hunter-gatherer populations, allowing them to potentially spend more calories on growth rather than on foraging effort, and thus reach sexual maturity at a younger age. This may lengthen their reproductive lifespan, compensating for their shorter life expectancy and their high infant and later childhood mortality rates. Although early marriage is the general practice for Pumé hunter-gatherers, {{there is no evidence}} of coercion of girls to marry or begin sexual relations before they feel ready.|$|E

30|$|Quite surprisingly, {{migration}} at working ages assumptions in the Eurostat projections has {{an almost}} {{no effect on}} convergence in aging in the long run. This {{can be explained by}} the assumption that there will be convergence in every <b>demographic</b> <b>indicator,</b> which are baseline assumptions of the EUROPOP 2013 regional population projections. Interestingly, the contribution of migration at working ages is crucial in explaining the biggest fluctuation of the effect of change in working-age population during the observed period. The most notable is the change of the trend in 2009, which is likely to be caused by sharpened out-migration from East-European regions after the outbreak of the economic crisis, and the preceding local peak of 2004 – 2005 was, most likely, linked to the increased migration intensities after the biggest EU enlargement. The relative importance of migration during the observed period and the lack of effect on the projected period indicate that convergence in migration flows, as projected by the basic Eurostat scenario, may not be the most realistic outcome.|$|E

Infant mortality rates are formally defined as the number of infant deaths (excluding still births) by infants of less than one year of age out of every one-thousand infants born.

Existing literature on this issue suggests that migration patterns change according to local conditions at the origin in Mexico and patrolling strategies at the border. A <b>demographic</b> <b>indicator</b> called the Migration Propensity Index (MPI) is used to quantify the amount of immigration {{from the state and}} municipio of origin in Mexico to the sector of destination in the U. S. This index is calculated using population counts for areas in Mexico and amounts of total apprehended immigrants originating from those areas. Using apprehension data from 1999 to 2006, this study identified Mexican states that had higher and lower sending rates of illegal immigrants to each of the ten Border Patrol sectors of the southwest U. S. -Mexico border (Livermore, San Diego, El Centro, Yuma, Tucson, El Paso, Marfa, Del Rio, Laredo, and McAllen). Having identified those states, it showed a consistent trend in the study period. Investigating further at a higher spatial resolution, the municipio level, allowed the validation of patterns found at the state level. Finally, global and local spatial autocorrelation indexes were used to identify clustered areas of municipios showing high and low MPI values; and census and socio-economic variables for selected municipios were used to find correlation between MPI and conditions of life at the origin...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: The current {{demographic}} trend brings {{changes such as}} declining birthrate, ageing of the population or the entry {{of a new generation}} of people in the labour market. This development naturally has an impact on the business environment. The above factors are also enhanced by the effects of the 2008 economic crisis. This situation requires organizations to adapt to these changes in order to be able to effectively supplement staffing needs e. g. from unused labour reserves. One of these unused reserves is the group of graduates without experience. Methods: This paper was prepared based on an analysis of secondary and primary data. Primary data was obtained through a questionnaire survey (n= 420 students) using a modified version of “The Culture Compass” method designed by Pauly Chu, an American expert on diversity issues. Scientific aim: The aim of the paper is to identify the profile of individual cultural orientations of the Czech Generation Y and their comparison with results obtained abroad. Findings: On the basis of research, the prevailing profile of individual cultural orientations of a sample of respondents and two less significant ones were identified. Moreover, events were identified which the respondents believe have influenced the development of their personalities. A comparison with results obtained abroad was carried out. In terms of organization and personnel management, workforce diversity of employees in terms of a <b>demographic</b> <b>indicator</b> (age) was identified. Conclusions: This research confirms the opinion that Generation Y is the first globalized generation in the society. The results reveal that the Czech Generation Y shows similar attitudes and views as their peers in the West. A slight difference was probably caused by partially different conditions in which they grew up. At the same time, the indicated type of events that influenced the development of their personalities was the same...|$|E
