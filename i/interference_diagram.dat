40|$|Compressor and turbine bladed wheels {{interact}} with the fluid distributed by the stator vanes. They are subject to vibration and fatigue loading, especially when resonance conditions are excited. Avoiding resonance is fundamental when designing bladed wheels. The Campbell diagram approach is too conservative since bladed wheels show many close frequency natural modes, thus {{it is almost impossible}} to avoid frequency matching. Singh's Advanced Frequency Evaluation (SAFE) diagram, or <b>interference</b> <b>diagram,</b> also introduces shape matching in addition to the frequency, for resonance prediction, therefore many frequency matching cases can be identified as non-critical and thus tolerated. The present paper explains and demonstrates the SAFE diagram by introducing an analytical expression to identify bladed wheel resonance conditions. The mode shape matching with a harmonic component is investigated by means of specific examples. Symmetry properties of the matching distribution of harmonic indices and mode shapes are also introduced and demonstrated. Finally, a bladed wheel analysis is used for validation, both in FE simulations and experiments...|$|E

In evaluating interferences, the SAFE diagram compares not only the frequencies of exciting harmonics with natural frequencies of blades, but also the shape of these harmonics with the normal mode shapes of a completely bladed disc including packeted blading. Examples are given of cases where the Campbell diagram predicts a dangerous resonance while the SAFE diagram shows that no resonances exist which are supported by experience.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{screening}} {{effect for the}} multiparton interactions (MPI) for proton–deuteron collisions in the kinematics where one parton belonging to the deuteron has small x 1, so the leading twist shadowing is present, while the second parton (x 2) {{is involved in the}} interaction in the kinematics where shadowing effects are small. We find that the ratio of the shadowing and the impulse approximation terms is approximately a factor of 2 larger for MPI than for the single parton distributions. We also calculate the double parton antishadowing (DPA) contribution to the cross section due to the independent interactions of the partons of the projectile proton with two nucleons of the deuteron and find that shadowing leads to a strong reduction of the DPA effect. For example, for the resolution scale Q 12 ∼ 4   GeV 2 of the interaction with parton x 1 we find that shadowing reduces the DPA effect by ∼ 30  %.

40|$|Lecturepg. 43 - 48 Based on the {{development}} of numerical analysis techniques over the past decade, the engineer can easily model the internal flow conditions and vibration characteristics of turbomachinery. When focusing on vibration response of rotating blades, it is easy to predict the resonance frequency; however difficulty remains in the prediction of vibrational stress. The primary reasons include: The unsteady external excitation force and vibration response are complicated making it difficult to calculate these characteristics precisely, and; It is likewise difficult to confirm the simulation results of vibration response since the actual measurement of vibrational stress on the rotating blades presents its own set of challenges. The authors already introduced the measured actual stress on mechanical drive steam turbine blades at the resonance condition with nozzle wake during full load testing and compared the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). On the contrary, there is not much study or discussion regarding compressor impeller resonance stress based on measuring actual stress. Considering that compressor impeller sizing has increased, it is important to deeply study the vibration phenomena relating to internal flow and blade cascade interaction excitation forces and create a clear criteria for designing large, robust impellers. In this regard, the authors introduce a unique stress measurement technique for rotating blades at full load by specially designing flexible, high response impellers to emphasize the vibration stress. The basic vibration characteristics of the nodal diameter <b>interference</b> <b>diagram</b> and Campbell diagram are explained. In order to estimate vibrational stress on the blades, the unsteady CFD analysis is applied for calculation of the external excitation force and the vibration response is analyzed. The analyzed detail results are compared with the actual measured vibration stress and vibration response systematically. Through this study, the resonance with the inlet guide vanes (IGV) and a unique blade/stator cascade interaction phenomena are found. Subsequently, the cause of these phenomena is investigated, and the authors try to explain this mechanism. Finally, based on the correlation between the measured and analyzed vibration stresses over the entire whole flow path, the strength criterion is studied as a guideline, by comparing application experience...|$|E

40|$|The Drell-Yan {{process is}} {{considered}} {{as a case study}} to investigate two different aspects of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics: the search for a next-to-soft factorization formalism to organize next-to-leading-power (NLP) threshold logarithms to all orders, and the development of new methods based on unitarity to efficiently compute fixed-order cross-sections of single-particle inclusive processes. Specifically, considering the abelian part of the real-virtual <b>interference</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the two-loop Drell-Yan K-factor, next-to-soft corrections are studied with three different approaches: the use of diagrammatic techniques, the method of regions, and an approach based on the soft-collinear factorization formula. In this investigation special care is needed for collinear effects, which lead to the definition of a radiative jet function, computed {{here for the first time}} at one-loop. The final result of this analysis is a full control of abelian-like NLP logarithms that paves the way for a full resummation formalism. For what concerns unitarity methods, the formulation in Mellin space of the optical theorem for Deep Inelastic Scattering is generalized to the Drell-Yan case through a diagram-by-diagram approach based on unitary cuts. Crucial to this analysis is the removal of unphysical cuts by means of diagram-independent prescriptions in Mellin space. This approach offers an alternative method to compute the NNLO Drell-Yan cross-section and seems a promising tool for the computation of inclusive cross-sections at NNNLO...|$|R

The effect of the shaft’s flexibility on the dynamic characteristics of the bladed discs and the coupling effects between the shaft and bladed disc modes are investigated. Results show clearly the coupling effects in a bladed disc-shaft system. <b>Interference</b> <b>diagrams</b> are developed, from which the {{dynamic behaviour}} of a bladed disc can be predicted for varying flexibility relationships between solid shafts and bladed discs. The global rotating mode shapes of flexible tuned and mistuned bladed disc-shaft assemblies are calculated.

Calculated natural frequencies obtained from the blade, the bladed disc and the shaft with two discs are checked to discover resonance conditions and coupling effects. It is shown that blade mistuning strongly affects the interaction between flexible bladed discs and a flexible shaft. This interaction affects the flexible bladed disc modes and is not restricted to the modes with zero, one and two nodal diameters.

40|$|In general {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with high energy elementary particle physics and in particular it discusses the interactions {{in the framework of}} the multiperipheral context. The first chapter is a general introduction to the field where different observables of interest, such as cross-section and multiplicity, are defined and discussed. In the second chapter after introducing different multi-particle production mechanisms, such as multiperipheral and diffractive models, we put more emphasis on the former and study different models of the type. The impact parameter space is a suitable place to work in, so we transform the multi-particle amplitude to this space and extract interesting results out of it in chapter 3.

We show {{that it is hard to}} reconcile the model with the experimentally observed radius of elastic scattering as a function of energy. The fourth chapter is about the <b>interference</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the multiperipheral model in the unitarity equation. As energy increases the number of such terms increases rapidly.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the Yukawa coupling of the top quark is one important goal of particle physics after {{the discovery of the}} Higgs boson. There are two processes that offer the possibility to directly measure the Yukawa coupling of the top quark at the LHC. These are the production of a top-antitop-quark pair in association with a Higgs boson via the strong interaction (tt̅H) and the electroweak production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson (tH). In the Standard Model, the cross section for tH production is much smaller than the cross section for tt̅H production as there is a destructive <b>interference</b> between <b>diagrams</b> where the Higgs boson is radiated off a top quark and diagrams where it is radiated off a W boson. Despite the reduced cross section, this interference provides additional sensitivity to the sign of the Yukawa coupling.
