25|$|Because {{natural gas}} is not a pure product, as the {{reservoir}} pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon <b>isothermic</b> depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method {{to deal with this}} problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of a {{thermodynamic}} process involving a photon gas, consider a cylinder with a movable piston. The interior walls of the cylinder are [...] "black" [...] in order that the temperature of the photons can be maintained at a particular temperature. This means that the space inside the cylinder will contain a blackbody-distributed photon gas. Unlike a massive gas, this gas will exist without the photons being introduced from the outside – the walls will provide the photons for the gas. Suppose the piston is pushed all the way into the cylinder so that there is an extremely small volume. The photon gas inside the volume will press against the piston, moving it outward, and in order for the transformation to be <b>isothermic,</b> a counter force of almost the same value will have to be applied to the piston so that the motion of the piston is very slow. This force will be equal to the pressure times the cross sectional area (A) of the piston. This process can be continued at a constant temperature until the photon gas is at a volume V0. Integrating the force over the distance (x) traveled yields the total work done to create this photon gas at this volume ...|$|E

5000|$|Subsequent {{detailed}} {{studies of}} concentration {{and speed of}} cooling behavior of Shpolskii systems by L. A.

[...] <b>Isothermic</b> annealing of the supersaturated rapidly frozen solutions of dibenzofuran in heptane was performed, and it was shown that {{the return of the}} metastable system to equilibrium in time reasonable for laboratory observation required the annealing temperature to be close to the melting temperature of the metastable frozen solution.

Early in his employment he was sent to Europe to purchase books for the library at the Arboretum. When the Journal of the Arnold Arboretum was started in 1919, Rehder was co-editor, along with the Arboretum director, Charles Sprague Sargent. Rehder produced a new edition of Manual of Cultivated Trees and Shrubs and authored the Bibliography of Cultivated Trees and Shrubs and The Bradley bibliography. He was co-author, with Ernest Henry Wilson, of Plantae Wilsonianae and A Monograph of Azaleas. Rehder created the first system of <b>isothermic</b> zones for the United States that related average winter minimum temperatures to the hardiness of specific plants.

5000|$|IDEAL (Integrated Design, Evaluation, and Assessment of Loadings) is a post-construction {{water quality}} model for {{designing}} stormwater {{best management practices}} (BMP) (see Best management practice for water pollution) and calculating their effectiveness in removing common stormwater pollutants (sediments, bacteria, nitrogen and phosphorus). The model's runoff treatment algorithms are process-based by predicting runoff rates and pollutant loads and routing these loadings through BMPs using technologies which have been experimentally validated. [...] Using <b>isothermic</b> relationships along with accepted decay, settling, and infiltration methods, pollutant trapping in BMPs is computed. The developers of the IDEAL model are Bill Barfield (Regents Professor at Oklahoma State University, Woolpert Inc.) and John Hayes of Clemson University. Currently, six BMPs can be modeled with IDEAL: sand filters, wet and dry detention basin, bioswales, bioretention cells, and vegetated filter strips. The ability to model engineered devices has recently been developed, but requires trapping efficiency information to be input. Rainwater tanks or cisterns can also be modeled. Currently, hydraulic modeling of closed systems and open channels is simplistic.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{publication}} of its discovery, HDA technology is being used for a [...] "simple, easy to adapt nucleic acid test {{for the detection of}} Clostridium difficile". [...] Other applications include the rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus [...] by the amplification and detection of a short DNA sequence specific to the bacterium. The advantages of HDA is that it provides a rapid method of nucleic acid amplification of a specific target at an <b>isothermic</b> temperature that does not require a thermal cycler. However, the optimisation of primers and sometimes buffers is required beforehand by the researcher. Normally primer and buffer optimisation is tested and achieved through PCR, raising the question of the need to spend extra on a separate system to do the actual amplification. Despite the selling point that HDA negates the use of a thermal cycler and therefore allows research to be conducted in the field, much of the work required to detect potentially hazardous microorganisms is carried out in a research/hospital lab setting regardless. At present, mass diagnoses from a great number of samples cannot yet be achieved by HDA, whereas PCR reactions carried out in thermal cycler that can hold multi-well sample plates allows for the amplification and detection of the intended DNA target from a maximum of 96 samples. The cost of purchasing reagents for HDA are also relatively expensive to that of PCR reagents, more so since it comes as a ready-made kit.|$|E
