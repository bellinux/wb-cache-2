5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. <b>Interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|In archaea such as Thermoplasma acidophilum, all the α {{and all the}} β {{subunits}} are identical, whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such {{as those}} in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit. In mammals, the β1, β2, and β5 subunits are catalytic; although they share a common mechanism, they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH). Alternative β forms denoted β1i, β2i, and β5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro-inflammatory signals such as cytokines, in particular, <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma.</b> The proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the immunoproteasome, whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal proteasome.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. <b>Interferon</b> <b>gamma</b> release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} if exogenous <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> {{is effective in}} immunosuppressed mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, recombinant murine <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> was administered to cyclosporin-treated mice with either acute or chronic T. cruzi infection. <b>Gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> significantly decreased parasitemia and prevented death in acutely infected mice. Parasitemias and mortality of mice treated with both <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> and cyclosporin {{were similar to those}} of immunocompetent controls. In chronically infected mice, cyclosporin treatment produced significantly more organ explant cultures positive for T. cruzi. Fewer positive cultures, particularly for spleen and heart, were obtained from cyclosporin-treated mice when they also received <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon.</b> Ketoconazole treatment of mice resulted in no positive cultures. Cyclosporin treatment did not prevent activation of peritoneal macrophages by parenteral <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon,</b> nor did it have a consistent effect on serum titers of alpha/beta or <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> in response to a second challenge inoculum of T. cruzi. These data indicate that exogenous <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> suppresses acute and chronic T. cruzi infection in cyclosporin-treated mice but that <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is not as effective as the relatively specific antimicrobial ketoconazole. <b>Gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> activates macrophages despite cyclosporin treatment, and its effects appear to be tissue specific...|$|R

40|$|We showed {{previously}} {{that the}} mouse fibroblastoid cell line Ltk-aprt- is {{resistant to the}} antiviral effects of beta interferon. This lack of response reflects a partial sensitivity to the interferon that {{is accompanied by a}} failure to activate expression of several interferon-regulated genes, although certain other genes respond in a normal manner. We show here that Ltk-aprt- cells were also unable to establish an antiviral state and to activate expression of 2, 5 -oligo(A) synthetase when treated with <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon.</b> Strikingly, however, treatment with a combination of beta <b>interferon</b> and <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> provided complete protection against viral replication. Although the cells were completely insensitive to up to 250 U of the interferons per ml added singly, essentially complete protection from viral cytopathic effects was achieved when as little as 10 U of each of the interferons per ml were combined. Expression of 2, 5 -oligo(A) synthetase was also sensitive to this synergistic effect. Activation of an antiviral state could also be achieved by sequential treatment, first with <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> and then with beta interferon. Partial protection against viral replication could be achieved by pretreatment with <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> for as little as 1 h before incubation with beta interferon and could be blocked by the addition of specific antibodies or by cycloheximide, indicating that <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> induces the synthesis of a protein which can act synergistically with a signal produced by the beta-interferon receptor. We suggest that Ltk-aprt- cells suffer from defects in one or more components of the gene activation pathways for both type I and type II <b>interferons.</b> Nonetheless, <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is able to activate the expression of a gene encoding a protein required for signal transduction.

40|$|The <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> assay {{is used to}} {{identify}} Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected animals. It {{has been suggested that}} regulatory mechanisms could influence the sensitivity of the test when it is performed with cells from cattle and that the neutralization of interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) in vitro would increase the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> responses. To investigate the regulatory mechanisms affecting the <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> assay with cells from goats, blood was collected from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-exposed, and noninfected goats. Neutralization of IL- 10 by a monoclonal antibody resulted in increased levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPDj) -stimulated samples from both infected and exposed goats. However, the levels of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> release were also increased in unstimulated cells and in PPDj-stimulated cells from some noninfected animals following neutralization. Depletion of putative regulatory CD 25 high T cells had no clear effect on the number of gamma-interferon-producing cells. The IL- 10 -producing cells were identified to be mainly CD 14 + major histocompatibility complex class II-positive monocytes in both PPDj-stimulated and control cultures and not regulatory T cells. However, possible regulatory CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells produced IL- 10 in response to concanavalin A stimulation. The numbers of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 8 + γδT-cell receptor-positive cells producing <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> increased following IL- 10 neutralization. These results provide insight into the source and the role of IL- 10 in <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> assays with cells from goats and suggest that IL- 10 from monocytes can regulate both innate and adaptive <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> production from several cell types.

25|$|The {{cause of}} lichen planus is unknown, {{but it is}} not {{contagious}} and does not involve any known pathogen. It is thought to be a T cell mediated autoimmune reaction (where the body's immune system targets its own tissues). This autoimmune process triggers apoptosis of the epithelial cells. Several cytokines are involved in lichen planus, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma,</b> interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. This autoimmune, T cell mediated, process is thought to be in response to some antigenic change in the oral mucosa, but a specific antigen has not been identified.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of interferons on the {{induction}} of human monocyte secretion of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) activity by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Monocytes do not spontaneously produce IL- 1 {{and the addition of}} interferons to the culture does not lead to detectable secretion. Addition of LPS alone induces the release of measurable amounts of IL- 1 activity. The addition of low doses (1 - 10 units/ml) of alpha, beta, or <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> to the LPS-stimulated cultures further increases this secretion by 50 %. The addition of 1000 units/ml of alpha or beta interferon leads to inhibition of IL- 1 release. By contrast, <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is a dose dependent enhancer of IL- 1 release. The effect of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> is on the production of IL- 1 and is not an enhancement of IL- 1 activity in the biological assay. Results demonstrate that addition of <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> to monocytes increases the rate of secretion of IL- 1 by these cells. <b>Gamma</b> <b>interferon</b> also appears to abrogate the loss in the ability of monocytes to produce IL- 1 activity after overnight culture. This last result parallels the maintainence of the expression of the HLA-DR surface marker on monocytes by <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon.</b> These results may help define a mechanism involving IL- 1 generation which could have bearing on the in vivo pyrogenic effects of purified <b>gamma</b> <b>interferon...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{large number}} of {{activated}} T-cells generates a massive immune response which is not specific to any particular epitope on the SAg thus undermining {{one of the fundamental}} strengths of the adaptive immune system, that is, its ability to target antigens with high specificity. More importantly, the {{large number of}} activated T-cells secrete large amounts of cytokines, the most important of which is <b>Interferon</b> <b>gamma.</b> This excess amount of IFN-gamma in turn activates the macrophages. The activated macrophages, in turn, over-produce proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is particularly important {{as a part of the}} body's inflammatory response. In normal circumstances it is released locally in low levels and helps the immune system defeat pathogens. However, when it is systemically released in the blood and in high levels (due to mass T-cell activation resulting from the SAg binding), it can cause severe and life-threatening symptoms, including shock and multiple organ failure.|$|E
500|$|... 20S proteasomes {{can also}} {{associate}} {{with a second}} type of regulatory particle, the 11S regulatory particle, a heptameric structure that does not contain any ATPases and can promote the degradation of short peptides but not of complete proteins.

The mechanisms by which it binds to the core particle through the C-terminal tails of its subunits and induces α-ring conformational changes to open the 20S gate suggest a similar mechanism for the 19S particle.

500|$|The {{proteasome}} plays {{a straightforward}} but {{critical role in}} the function of the adaptive immune system. Peptide antigens are displayed by the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC) proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

Although constitutively expressed proteasomes can participate in this process, a specialized complex composed of proteins, whose expression is induced by <b>interferon</b> <b>gamma,</b> are the primary producers of peptides which are optimal in size and composition for MHC binding. These proteins whose expression increases during the immune response include the 11S regulatory particle, whose main known biological role is regulating the production of MHC ligands, and specialized β subunits called β1i, β2i, and β5i with altered substrate specificity. The complex formed with the specialized β subunits is known as the immunoproteasome.
