25|$|In the 1980s, {{cyberpunk}} authors like William Gibson {{turned away}} from the optimism and support for progress of traditional science fiction. This dystopian vision of the near future is described in the work of Philip K. Dick, such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and We Can Remember <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>You</b> Wholesale, which resulted in the films Blade Runner and Total Recall. The Star Wars franchise helped spark a new interest in space opera. C. J. Cherryh's detailed explorations of alien life and complex scientific challenges influenced a generation of writers.|$|E

Screenwriter Dan O'Bannon had completed his adaptation of Dick's short story Second Variety in the early 1980s (along with his adaptation of another of Dick's short stories, We Can Remember <b>It</b> <b>For</b> <b>You</b> Wholesale, which became the 1990 film Total Recall). By 1983, O'Bannon's screenplay for Screamers had been optioned by Tom Naud (SFX designer on the 1981 film Outland). However, the production never went ahead as planned and {{it was not until the}} 1990s that Screamers went into production, by which time the screenplay had been rewritten by Miguel Tejada-Flores. The film, directed by Christian Duguay, was made in Canada. Locations included a quarry in Quebec, in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, as well as Joliette.|$|E

500|$|Becky {{formed a}} {{friendship}} with local residents Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh). Becky's on-screen partnership with Roy was particularly successful.

Kelly spoke of Becky's different attributes in their relationship, during an interview stating: [...] "She absolutely believes that she's 100% in love with him. I see it as a very teenage relationship because of the on-off status. Becky's very mature in many ways– she's very streetwise and if you needed something, you'd go to Becky and she'd find <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> But emotionally, she's very immature. That's a lot to do with why she gets on so well with Roy because he's quite emotionally immature, too. It's probably the one level that they do connect on."

500|$|Comedian Ed Byrne {{performed}} a skit {{in which he}} jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: [...] "The only ironic thing about that song is it's called 'Ironic' and it's written {{by a woman who}} doesn't know what irony is. That's quite ironic." [...] Also, satirists Berger and Wyse parodied the song in one segment of their cartoon strip The Pitchers. In that episode, a superhero named [...] "Irony Man" [...] compared his superpowers to lyrics from Morissette's song, causing his cohorts to rename him [...] "The Man from Alanis". In December 2009, the comedy website CollegeHumor released a spoof video of the song called [...] "Actually Ironic", featuring actress Sarah Natochenny, in which Patrick Cassels amended the lyrics in a form that would be appropriately ironic. The CollegeHumor spoof was replicated in July 2013 by sisters Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, from New York City, who published their version on YouTube. The sisters sing the line [...] "We fixed <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Alanis. You're welcome." [...] throughout their [...] "It's Finally Ironic" [...] video.

500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E
