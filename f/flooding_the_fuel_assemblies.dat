Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the holddown assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly.</b> Because <b>the</b> TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top nozzle adapter plate of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> and <b>the</b> rodlets are hanging in the guide thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> nozzle support. <b>The</b> added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly's</b> dynamic characteristics.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the modeling of a PWR <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> under dynamic shock loading {{in support of}} the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) shaker test campaign. The focus of the test campaign is on evaluating the response of used fuel to shock and vibration loads that a can occur during highway transport. Modeling began in 2012 using an LS-DYNA <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> model that was first created for modeling impact scenarios. SNL’s proposed test scenario was simulated through analysis and the calculated results helped guide the instrumentation and other aspects of the testing. During FY 2013, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> model was refined to better represent the test surrogate. Analysis of the proposed loads suggested the frequency band needed to be lowered to attempt to excite the lower natural frequencies of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly.</b> Despite SNL’s expansion of lower frequency components in their five shock realizations, pretest predictions suggested a very mild dynamic response to the test loading. After testing was completed, one specific shock case was modeled, using recorded accelerometer data to excite the model. Direct comparison of predicted strain in the cladding was made to the recorded strain gauge data. The magnitude of both sets of strain (calculated and recorded) are very low, compared to the expected yield strength of the Zircaloy- 4 material. The model was accurate enough to predict that no yielding of the cladding was expected, but its precision at predicting micro strains is questionable. The SNL test data offers some opportunity for validation of the finite element model, but the specific loading conditions of the testing only excite <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> to respond in a limited manner. For example, the test accelerations were not strong enough to substantially drive <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> out of contact with the basket. Under this test scenario, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> model does a reasonable job of approximating actual <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> response, a claim that can be verified through direct comparison of model results to recorded test results. This does not offer validation for <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> model in all conceivable cases, such as high kinetic energy shock cases where <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> might lift off the basket floor to strike to basket ceiling. This type of nonlinear behavior was not witnessed in testing, so the model does not have test data to be validated against. a basis for validation in cases that substantially alter <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> response range. This leads to a gap in knowledge that is identified through this modeling study. The SNL shaker testing loaded a surrogate <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> with a certain set of artificially-generated time histories. One thing all the shock cases had in common was an elimination of low frequency components, which reduces the rigid body dynamic response of the system. It is not known if the SNL test cases effectively bound all highway transportation scenarios, or if significantly greater rigid body motion than was tested is credible. This knowledge gap could be filled through modeling the vehicle dynamics of a used fuel conveyance, or by collecting acceleration time history data from an actual conveyance under highway conditions...|$|R
