50|$|Exxon is {{responsible}} for clean-up of environmental damage caused by oil facilities, and {{has been the subject}} of extended litigation. As of 2015, Exxon has completed a soil investigation at the 324-acre terminal. It has until May 7, 2016, to finish its groundwater investigation under a bill passed unanimously by the New Jersey Legislature in late 2013 that gave polluters a deadline extension on investigating cleanups. according to the NJ DEP, clean-up at Constable Hook has included <b>excavation,</b> <b>stabilization,</b> capping, and the capturing of ground water contamination and installation of steel wall containment systems.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} development of a region depends on the speed that people and goods can travel. The reduction of people and goods travel time {{can be achieved by}} planning smooth road layouts, which are obtained by crossing natural obstacles such as hills, by tunneling at great depths, and allowing the reduction of the road alignment length. The stress state in rock masses at such depths, either because of the overburden or due to the tectonic conditions of the rock mass induces high convergences of the tunnel walls. These high convergence values are incompatible with the supports structural performance installed in the <b>excavation</b> <b>stabilization.</b> In this article it is intended to evaluate and analyze some of the solutions already implemented in several similar geological and geotechnical situations, in order to establish a methodological principle for the design of the tunnels included in a highway section under construction in the region influenced by the Himalayas, in the state of Himachal Pradesh (India) and referenced by "four laning of Kiratpur to Ner Chowk section"...|$|E

" The {{purpose of the study}} was to offset future disturbances and damages to these farmsteads, and it includes "archival investigations, architectural documentation, oral-history interviews of long-time area residents and family members, farm equipment and artifact analyses, archaeological <b>excavations,</b> <b>stabilization</b> measures, and the development of interpretative exhibits for area schools, museums, and the general public" (p. i) ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of {{the early}} efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, {{starting}} in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological <b>excavations,</b> <b>stabilization</b> of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House.|$|R
40|$|Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has led {{the efforts}} for lunar and Martian landing site preparation, {{including}} <b>excavation,</b> soil <b>stabilization,</b> and plume damage prediction. There has been much discussion of sintering but until our team recently demonstrated it for the lunar case there was little understanding of the serious challenges. Simplistic sintering creates a crumbly, brittle, weak surface unsuitable for a rocket exhaust plume. The goal of this project is to solve those problems and {{make it possible to}} land a human class lander on Mars, making terminal landing of humans on Mars possible for the first time...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} current physics topics, {{including}} long-baseline neutrino physics, proton decay searches, and supernova neutrino searches, hope to someday construct huge (50 kiloton to megaton) particle detectors in shielded, underground sites. With today's practices, this requires the costly <b>excavation</b> and <b>stabilization</b> of large rooms in mines. In this paper, we propose utilizing the caverns {{created by the}} solution mining of salt. The challenge is that such caverns must be filled with pressurized fluid and do not admit human access. We sketch some possible methods of installing familiar detector technologies in a salt cavern under these constraints. Some of the detectors discussed are also suitable for deep-sea experiments, discussed briefly. These sketches appear challenging but feasible, and appear to force few major compromises on detector capabilities. This scheme offers avenues for enormous cost savings on future detector megaprojects. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Many natural slopes were {{subjected}} to change in geometry {{in order to make}} room for construction of infrastructures. This paper presents stability analysis of a natural slope subjected to cutting {{to make room for the}} development of factories in an industrial site. The analysis was performed for the most critical slope section and analysis was made in comparison to the case presented in literature. Data required for slope stability analysis were retrieved from relevant project report. The result shows that the stability of the slope decreases due to slope <b>excavation</b> and <b>stabilization</b> should be done in order to limit further reduction of shear strength due to yielding of soil mass. Analysis using circular failure surface such as Simplified Bishop is simple and is usually suitable for analysis of existing slope where there is no indication of incipient failure. However, pre-defined failure surface in Morgensten Price method is more useful if failure surface could be predicted based on slope assessment or when rectification work has been applied...|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, repairs were {{recommended}} {{to the building}} that totaled an estimated $70,000. [...] After two and half centuries, the building constructed from solid timbers, suffered from “dry not rot and beetle teeth”. [...] A volunteer archeological crew from New York University and the New York State Division for Historic Preservation was formed to survey the site for stabilization work funded by the Society of Friends and {{a grant from the}} National Park Service. [...] The crew conducted tests to determine the nature of the surface below the Meeting House floor. [...] Since no evidence of significant cultural or archaeological artifacts were found, it was determined that <b>excavation</b> for the <b>stabilization</b> work could continue.|$|R
50|$|Adolph Bandelier {{provided}} one of {{the first}} detailed archaeological maps and descriptions of Classic period architecture at the central locus, or Compound A, of the Casa Grande site, in 1884. Jesse Walter Fewkes and Cosmos Mindeleff made further descriptions of this area. Between 1906 and 1912, Fewkes conduced <b>excavations</b> and <b>stabilization</b> of this portion of the site. In 1927, Harold Gladwin excavated stratified tests of several trash mounds at both the Grewe and Casa Grande sites. He also defined and excavated portions of Sacaton 9:6 (GP), an adobe-walled compound situated on the extreme edge of the Casa Grande site, east of State Route 87, near the current entrance to the monument. Relatively large-scale excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1931, by Van Bergen-Los Angeles Museum Expedition under the direction of Arthur Woodward and Irwin Hayden. This project concentrated on a 30 acre parcel at the Grewe site, and Compound F located within the northeast corner of the Casa Grande National Monument. Overall, including the recovery of 172 burials {{and hundreds of thousands of}} artifacts, about 60 pithouses, numerous pits, 27 adobe pitrooms, and a ballcourt were excavated or tested during the course of this project.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a global assessment}} {{of the quality of}} the engineering works associated with rock excavation for the construction of the permanent shiplock of the Three Gorges Project (TGP). The shiplock was constructed between 1995 and 1999 by open and deep excavation in a mountain comprising weathered and fresh granite. Since the shiplock is the main navigation structure for ships to pass through the Three Gorges Dam after the dam is completed, it is prudent to summarize the experience and information obtained during the design and construction of the engineering works associated with rock excavation. This paper adopts the meta-synthesis theory (MST) to quantitatively assess the global quality of such engineering works in rocks. The paper {{presents a}} detailed discussion along with summative data on the rock conditions, the engineering measures and the monitored performance for this quality assessment. The assessment results show that the global quality of the rock engineering works in rocks can be rated as very good and that the rock <b>excavation</b> and <b>stabilization</b> measures can basically meet the high design standards and requirements of the permanent shiplock. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Contaminated {{lands are}} often the blight of concerted {{industrial}} activities in highly developed and industrialized countries. Unfortunately, Malaysia is not unaffected by this issue and thus requires intervention in terms of tightening of legislation regarding contaminated land as well as application of established remediation technologies. Since redevelopment of such sites are already earmarked under the 9 th Malaysia Plan, it is reckoned that the next step for related stakeholders {{is to focus on}} local customization or creation of cost-effective and effectual contaminated land remediation technologies. As applications of these technologies are still in their infancy in Malaysia, familiarity of such technologies is lacking among pertinent stakeholders. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an overview of the types of contaminated land remediation technologies with regards to their current usage and applicability in the Malaysian context. Technologies such as soil vapour extraction, bio-remediation, containment, solidification/ <b>stabilization,</b> <b>excavation</b> and phyto-remediation are described. It is suggested that a long-term strategy be established to ensure more expertise and technologies with regards to contaminated land remediation will be locally available. All agencies, either public or private should invest in the training of their personnel so that a pool of local experts can be made available in the near future...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{foundations}} of long-term management in the northern forests of Iran is the existence of forest roads network. Passing the roads through low to moderate slopes and areas with high level of stability, reduces the costs of excavation, earth filling, land <b>stabilization,</b> <b>excavation</b> gable roofs and earth filling, and thus reduces construction costs. This research {{was carried out in}} the Shafaroud forest in the west of Guilan province. The paper aims to develop a method using the GIS technology and MPSIAC model to produce the stability map for designing the new roads network in the study area. The results showed that the proposed road network with a length of 23908 meters compare to existing roads network with a length of 25280 meters, could generate a suitable coverage among the parcels. The length of the proposed roads network is 1372 meters less than the length of the existing roads and creates the highest percentage of coverage with the least length so that in addition to the reduction of costs the forestry plans could be directed in the way of sustainable development. Some 12 % of the proposed road passes through regions with high stability more than the existing road and the passage of the proposed road through the unstable regions as compared to the existing road has reduced two times and has had {{a significant difference in the}} level of 99 % and totally has reduced the corrosive effects of the road on the nature. Ultimately, the results yielded show that using the GIS can increase the accuracy of the designing and quality of the forest road network and reduce the costs...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of the treatability test is to evaluate and optimize polyphosphate remediation technology for infiltration either from ground surface, or some depth of <b>excavation,</b> providing direct <b>stabilization</b> of uranium within the deep vadose and capillary fringe above the 300 Area aquifer. Expected result from this experimental plan is a data package that includes: 1) quantification of the retardation of polyphosphate, 2) the rate of degradation and the retardation of degradation products {{as a function of}} water content, 3) an understanding of the mechanism of autunite formation via the reaction of solid phase calcite-bound uranium and aqueous polyphosphate remediation technology, 4) an understanding of the transformation mechanism, identity of secondary phases, and the kinetics of the reaction between uranyl-carbonate and –silicate minerals with the polyphosphate remedy under solubility-limiting conditions, 5) quantification of the extent and rate of uranium released and immobilized based on the infiltration rate of the polyphosphate remedy and the effect of and periodic wet-dry cycling on the efficacy of polyphosphate remediation for uranium in the vadose zone and capillary fringe, and 6) quantification of reliable equilibrium solubility values for autunite under hydraulically unsaturated conditions allowing accurate prediction of the long-term stability of autunite. Moreover, results of intermediate scale testing will quantify the transport of polyphosphate and degradation products, and yield degradation rates, at a scale that is bridging the gap between the small-scale UFA studies and the field scale. These results will be used to test and verify a site-specific, variable saturation, reactive transport model and to aid in the design of a pilot-scale field test of this technology. In particular, the infiltration approach and monitoring strategy of the pilot test would be primarily based on results from intermediate-scale testing. Results from this experimental plan will be documented in a PNNL report...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Executive Summary This Cultural Assets Literature Review and Research Synthesis {{report was}} {{undertaken}} by The Cairns Institute for the Office of Environment and Heritage, NSW. The project collates available information {{relevant to the}} understanding and mitigation of climate change impacts on cultural assets and seeks to draw out the themes and issues relevant to the broader Sydney area. The project components were conducted within a relatively tight time frame. These included a literature review, a survey of practitioners and agencies and local governments and 6 targeted interviews {{based in part on}} the feedback from the survey. Planning and preliminary work for the project began in late April and the literature review and survey was undertaken in May 2012. An EndNote database of all the literature reviewed was compiled. There are 324 references included in this database (see Appendix A). The targeted interviews were undertaken in July 2012. There were 47 respondents to the online survey. Significant themes and issues emerged from the literature review and survey including: •	Lack of research funding; •	Lack of political will and leadership on the part of government; •	Frustration that climate change impacts on cultural heritage are not being addressed by governments at all levels in Australia; •	The need for fine grained site specific research to go beyond general predictions; •	Opportunities for information sharing relating to research projects and outcomes between researchers, cultural asset managers and policy makers. •	The value of small community based projects AND •	The needed for larger scale projects that can draw together the knowledge gained from the geographically scattered projects into a more coherent picture; •	The importance of regular maintenance in maximising the resilience of cultural assets in the face of change; •	The need for long term monitoring of cultural assets and the collation and dissemination of this data; •	The importance of specific research on new pests and changing conditions and ways to mitigate these impacts; •	The importance of local council and state government agencies to build cultural assets into their general climate change preparedness, and •	A perceived urgency for identifying the likelihood of specific sites being negatively impacted and the development of priorities for research, mitigation and salvage. There is broad recognition that cultural assets will suffer both direct and indirect impacts as a result of climate change. Direct bio-physical impacts are generally likely to involve an escalation in frequency or an increase in intensity of the impacts that assets are already subjected to. Such impacts are likely to be cumulative over time. However some direct impacts for some cultural assets may be catastrophic. For example coastal sites that currently experience impacts such as salt corrosion, saltwater inundation, and heavy rain from coastal storms are expected to experience these impacts with increasing frequency. Strategies such as building the resilience of cultural assets through regular maintenance, effectively protecting assets from known and existing biophysical impacts and understanding when these impacts become critical through effective monitoring are the key to the sound management of cultural assets {{in the face of a}} changing climate. There is an urgent need to audit and assess the range, significance and distribution of cultural assets that might be affected by climate change and develop an informed response. Such a response might involve a range of interventions such as recording, salvage <b>excavation,</b> and <b>stabilization.</b> It is also important for governments to begin a conversation with the community about the nature and likelihood of climate change impacts on their cultural assets and to better understand community expectations for the management of these places. In many cases existing projects and programs may be able to be adapted so that they adequately address the issue of climate change and cultural heritage although increased investment in research and conservation activity will be required. Unfortunately, it is clear that governments in Australia are under- investing in cultural assets and this must be addressed. The cost of inaction now will compound the cost of remedial action for future generations as well as exacerbate the non-monetary costs associated with the social impact of the unnecessary loss of cultural heritage places and values. The climate change focus of local governments needs to shift from the immediate urgency of 'liability' back to a focus on nurturing and working for communities. In the short term however these fundamental shifts are unlikely to occur and this report has identified a number of opportunities to advance our understanding of the impacts of climate change on cultural assets and to develop useful projects with little additional financial commitment. These opportunities involve Local Government broadening existing projects and the State Government facilitating effective action through information sharing and the provisions of tools such as web based information repositories. The lessons from this research are not restricted to government. There is a body of research that indicated that there is a human tendency to be poorly prepared for distant, future and abstract risks and there is increasing concern that the professionalization of the cultural heritage industry has led to disengagement with heritage at the community level. Therefore it is essential that the heritage profession (including both individual practitioners and non government organisations) and asset managers find new ways to capture community attention to this important issue through communicating 'emotive and concrete understandings of heritage loss' (McCarthy 2011 : 9). ...|$|R
