25|$|NanoPutians are {{a series}} of organic {{molecules}} whose structural formulae resemble human forms. James Tour et al. (Rice University) <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesized</b> these compounds in 2003 {{as a part of a}} sequence on chemical education for young students. The compounds consist of two benzene rings connected via a few carbon atoms as the body, four acetylene units each carrying an alkyl group at their ends which represents the hands and legs, and a 1,3-dioxolane ring as the head. Tour and his team at Rice University used the NanoPutians in their NanoKids educational outreach program. The goal of this program was to educate children in the sciences in an effective and enjoyable manner. They have made several videos featuring the NanoPutians as anthropomorphic animated characters.|$|E

50|$|A common {{method to}} {{construct}} a targeted chemical library is to include known ligands {{of at least one}} and preferably several members of the target family. Since a portion of ligands that were <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesized</b> to bind to one family member will also bind to additional family members, the compounds contained in a targeted chemical library should collectively bind to a high percentage of the target family.|$|E

50|$|Conjugated polymers, such as polyfluorene, can be <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesized</b> with {{different}} properties {{for a wide}} variety of applications. The color of the molecules can be designed through synthetic control over the electron donating or withdrawing character of the substituents on fluorene or the comonomers in polyfluorene. Solubility of the polymers are important because solution state processing is very common. Since conjugated polymers, with their planar structure, tend to aggregate, bulky side chains are added (to the 9 position of fluorene) to increase the solubility of the polymer.|$|E
50|$|Although Igor's {{interest}} to the synthesis of chiral ligands has not been faded, he changed {{the general direction of}} his research once more, and now he works in the area of drug design. One of the main design principle is restriction of conformational mobility of the drug candidate molecules. Prof. Komarov's research group developed many approaches to synthesis of conformationally restricted amines and amino acids - the building blocks for drug design. Numerous conformationally restricted fluorine-containing amino acids were also <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesized,</b> with a purpose of using them as labels to study peptides in lipid bilayers by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.|$|E
30|$|Biological {{materials}} (such as bones or shells, etc.) with multiscale and hierarchical structures {{consisting of}} thick, hard inorganic mineral layers and thin, soft organic layers exhibit an excellent combination {{of strength and}} toughness [1, 2]. Although a number of metallic multilayered/laminated composites produced by various methods [3, 4] had revealed a high strength and a potential improvement of plasticity without losing strength owing to {{the contribution of the}} laminated structures and interfaces [5], a few efforts had been made to <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesize</b> bio-mimetic laminated materials with submicron-thick inorganic layers [6 â 11]. Theoretically, Gao et al. [12] demonstrated that when the critical length scale of the mineral inorganic platelets in natural materials drops below approximately 30 nm, the biomaterials became insensitive to flaws, i.e., the strength of a perfect mineral platelet was maintained despite defects. This intrigued us to <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>synthesize</b> the artificial counterparts of this composite with nanometer-thick constituent layers less than 30 nm.|$|R
