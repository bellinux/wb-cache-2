Understanding the tectonic setting of large <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> is important in earthquake hazard mitigation.

2500|$|On 21 November 2004, {{the islands}} of les Saintes were struck by an {{earthquake}} of magnitude 6.3. It was an <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquake</b> situated on a system of normal faults going from les Saintes {{to the north of}} Dominica. These faults are globally directed 135° (north-west to south-east), with dip north-east (Roseau fault, Ilet fault, Colibri fault, Marigot Fault) or south-west (Souffleur fault, Rodrigues fault, Redonda fault). These faults bound zones of rifts corresponding to an extension located on Roseau volcano (an inactive submarine volcano). The epicentre was offshore, located between the island of Dominica and les Saintes archipelago, at approximately 15°47'N 61°28'W, on Souffleur fault. The depth of the focus is located on the earth's crust, and is superficial, about [...] The concussions of the main shock and the numerous aftershocks were powerful, reaching an intensity of VIII (important structural damage) on the MSK scale. Damage to the most vulnerable properties in les Saintes, in Trois-Rivières (Guadeloupe) and in the North of Dominica were considerable. In Trois-Rivières, a collapsed wall killed a sleeping girl and seriously hurt her sister. In les Saintes, even though no-one was killed or badly wounded, many were traumatised by the strong and numerous aftershocks.|$|E

25|$|All tectonic plates have {{internal}} stress fields caused by {{their interactions with}} neighboring plates and sedimentary loading or unloading (e.g. deglaciation).

50|$|Interplate {{earthquakes}} {{differ from}} <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquake</b> in {{the intensity of}} stress drop which occurs after the quake. <b>Intraplate</b> <b>earthquake</b> have, on average, more stress drop {{than that of the}} interplate earthquake. Interplate earthquakes also differ fundamentally from intraplate earthquakes in the way stress is released and recovered. An interplate earthquake results in an immediate stress drop along the fault. Following this is a period of postseismic stress restoration. This restoration occurs quickly within the first few decades following the rupture and is due to tectonic loading and viscous relaxation in the lower crust. This results in a transfer of stress to the upper crust. Later on, a period of steady stress increase occurs due to tectonic loading.|$|E

We use bathymetric and seismic reflection data from the rupture area of the earthquakes in the northern Wharton Basin to demonstrate pervasive brittle deformation between the Ninetyeast Ridge and the Sunda subduction zone. In addition to evidence of recent strike-slip deformation along approximately north-south–trending fossil fracture zones, we identify a new type of deformation structure in the Indian Ocean: conjugate Riedel shears limited to the sediment section and oriented oblique to the north-south fracture zones. The Riedel shears developed in the Miocene, at a similar time to the onset of diffuse deformation in the central Indian Ocean. However, left-lateral strike-slip reactivation of existing fracture zones started earlier, in the Paleocene to early Eocene, and compartmentalizes the Wharton Basin. Modeled rupture during the 11 April 2012 <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> is consistent with the location of two reactivated, closely spaced, approximately north-south–trending fracture zones. However, we find no evidence for WNW-ESE–trending faults in the shallow crust, which is at variance with most of the earthquake fault models...|$|R

Both body and surface wave tomography has been applied to some significant intraplate seismic zones to explore the cause of <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes.</b> Pn tomography in the Central and Eastern United States reveals that the major intraplate seismic zones are all near the edges of high-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle. It indicates that the origin of <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> could be related to the rheological boundaries around rigid lithospheric roots where stress may accumulate. A joint teleseismic and local P tomographic study shows that the New Madrid Seismic Zone is associated with a local, NE-SW trending low-velocity anomaly in the lower crust and upper mantle, suggestive of a weak zone caused by local deformation due to rheological contrast. Rayleigh wave tomography in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau discovers a lithospheric velocity boundary that separates the low-velocity northeastern Tibet and the high-velocity Ordos and Sichuan blocks. Again, the velocity contrast zone is also linked to significant <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes...</b>|$|R

2500|$|According to the Mohr–Coulomb {{theory of}} [...] rock failure, large glacial loads {{generally}} suppress earthquakes, but [...] rapid deglaciation promotes earthquakes. According to Wu & Hasagawa, the rebound stress {{that is available}} to trigger earthquakes today is {{of the order of}} 1 MPa. This stress level is not large enough to rupture intact rocks but is large enough to reactivate pre-existing faults that are close to failure. Thus, both postglacial rebound and past tectonics play important roles in today's <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> in eastern Canada and southeast US. [...] Generally postglacial rebound stress could have triggered the <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> in eastern Canada and may have played some role in triggering earthquakes in the eastern US including the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811.

40|$|The {{earth was}} shown {{in the last century}} to have a surface layer {{composed}} of large plates. Plate tectonics is the study of the movement and stresses in the individual plates that make up the complete surface of the world's sphere. Two types of earthquakes are observed in the surface plates, interplate and <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes,</b> which are classified, based on the location of the origin of an earthquake either between two plates or within the plate respectively. Limited work has been completed on the definition of the boundary region between the plates from which interplate earthquakes originate, other than the recent work on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, defined at two degrees and the subsequent work to look at the applicability of this degree based definition. Others suggested an alternative view of a constant width for the interplate region in recent work at Texas A&M University. The objective of the paper is to determine whether the assumption of a linear width of the region along the tectonic plate boundaries to classify earthquakes as interplate and <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> using accepted statistical criteria provides a better fit to the data than the constant degree definition. There are three types of interplate boundaries defined by the relative movement of the two plates to each other, which further complicates this study. The study used a nonrandom analysis of regions of the different types of boundary to compare the rate and decay of the <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> from a notional centerline for the known boundaries. The study used GIS software and EXCEL for the statistical analysis component of the research work. The results show that a constant width definition provides a number of advantages in determining the relative definition of interplate and <b>intraplate</b> <b>earthquakes</b> when compared to the constant degree definition developed for work on the Mid Atlantic Ridge. Further research is suggested on a randomly selected set of study sites to improve the reliability and quality of the statistical work for each type of the boundary of the tectonic plates...|$|R
