40|$|Requiring {{the states}} to involve {{consumers}} in health planning through local health planning boards (HSAs) was {{an attempt by the}} federal government to control health care costs. Elimination of this requirement more recently has meant some states have discontinued the program. The elimination of HSAs can be considered a case of policy disinnovation. Drawing on the innovation literature, the following variables were expected to correlate, although negatively, with elimination of HSAs: value added to manufacturing, average acre value of farms, per capita income, population living in metropolitan areas, and party competition. All were found to correlate negatively. Predisposition to spend reflected in per capita state expenditures was also correlated negatively with elimination of HSAs, as was the average <b>daily</b> <b>hospital</b> room <b>charge</b> and average <b>hospital</b> cost per stay...|$|R

But the previous studies based on statistical analysis to predict the <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> for patients did not show satisfactory results.

We built an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a classification and regression tree (CART) model, and compared their prediction accuracy. Linear correlation coefficients were high in both models and the mean absolute errors were similar. But ANN models showed a better linear correlation than CART model (0. 813 vs. 0. 713 for the <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> paid by insurance and 0. 746 vs. 0. 720 for the <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> paid by patients).

Design Review of prospectively collected and mandatory reported Florida hospital discharge data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999. We used the 2 test for trend analysis to assess significant change in age, mortality, and complications, and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare inflation-adjusted <b>hospital</b> <b>charges,</b> comorbidity, length of stay, and secondary procedures. Setting Administrative database including all community- and university-based surgeons. Patients All patients 70 years or older who underwent colon resection from 1995 through 1999.

Results: The frequency of different colon resections increased by 10 % to 30 % from 1995 through 1999.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Percutaneous transluminal {{angioplasty}} with stenting (PTAS) of the {{carotid artery}} has been advocated {{as an alternative}} treatment for high-grade stenosis. Rationale for this approach includes less morbidity, shorter recovery, and lower cost when compared with carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods: The clinical results and <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> of patients who underwent elective treatment for carotid stenosis were reviewed. During a concurrent 14 -month period, 218 patients were admitted 229 times for 234 procedures {{for the treatment of}} 239 carotid bifurcation stenoses, 109 by PTAS and 130 by CEA. <b>Hospital</b> <b>charges</b> were reviewed for each hospitalization and were categorized according to radiology, operating room, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and all other <b>hospital</b> <b>charges.</b> Results: The combined incidence of postprocedure strokes and deaths were: PTAS, eight strokes (7. 7 %) and one death (0. 9 %); CEA, two strokes (1. 5 %) and two deaths (1. 5 %). Total <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> per admission for the two groups were $ 30, 140 for PTAS and $ 21, 670 for CEA. The average postprocedure length of stay for PTAS was 2. 9 days (median, 2 days) and for CEA was 3. 1 days (median, 3 days). Cardiac catheterization laboratory charges for the PTAS group were $ 12, 968, whereas the operating room charges for the CEA group were $ 4263. When hospitalizations that were extended by complications were excluded, the average total charges for the PTAS group (n = 84) dropped to $ 24, 848 (mean length of stay, 1. 9 days) and for the CEA group (n = 111) to $ 19, 247 (mean length of stay, 2. 6 days). Conclusions: After evaluating <b>hospital</b> <b>charges,</b> PTAS for the treatment of carotid stenosis cannot currently be justified on the basis of reduced costs alone. With future cost-containing measures, total <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> can be reduced in both groups. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 27 : 16 - 24. ...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transition}} from a centrally planned to a market economy, China's urban health insurance system is being reformed.

This study aims to examine the impact of the reform on <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> by comparing changes between two cities with different insurance systems and identifying determinants for those changes. Data was collected troth six hospitals in two cities, one city implemented an urban health insurance reform, the other did not. Acute appendicitis and normal childbirth were used as tracers for calculating <b>hospital</b> <b>charges.</b> Methods included the retrospective review of medical records, interviews with health policy makers and hospital staff, focus group discussions, and the review of hospital and health insurance documents. The results showed that <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> per case of acute appendicitis and childbirth increased 101 and 94 %, respectively, in the city without reform, and 41 and 34 % in the city with reform, between 1995 and 1999.

The combined measures of a single insurer, selective contracts, a new payment system, and use of an essential drug list, is regarded as the key features for an effective <b>hospital</b> <b>charge</b> control, and would appear to be successful measures for hospital expenditure containment within health insurance reform.

Purpose: Very few studies, however, have analyzed the economic implications of these two ACDF variations. We analyze the short-term hospital economic impact of these alternatives. Study Design and Setting: A retrospective study in a tertiary care center in central Georgia. Patient Sample: 550 consecutive elective 1 - or 2 -level ACDF patients met inclusion criteria for our study. 305 consecutive patients undergoing 1 -level ACDF with rigid plate fixation (mean age 50. 5 years) and 245 consecutive 2 -level patients (mean age 52. 6 years) received allograft implants (1 -level n= 86, 2 -level n= 33) or autograft (1 level n= 219, 2 -level n= 212) bone. 32 patients were treated in an outpatient setting. Outcome Measures: <b>Hospital</b> <b>charges</b> were reviewed for cost factors such as procedure time, hospital supplies, labor, and length of stay. Methods: T-tests were used to establish statistical significance of any differences between the studied variables with respect to the choice of allograft vs. autograft.

Allograft resulted in significant reductions in average length of stay (LOS) for 1 -level patients (0. 78 vs. 1. 37 days, p 0. 05). For <b>hospital</b> <b>charges,</b> allograft usage resulted in insignificantly higher mean <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> for 1 -level patients (allograft $ 17, 243, autograft $ 16, 969, p> 0. 05), but significantly increased <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> for 2 -level patients (allograft $ 21, 240, autograft $ 19, 056, p< 0. 01). Significant variances in cost included allograft implants in allograft procedures 1 s and pain pumps in autograft procedures. Conclusion: In 1 -level patients undergoing ACDF, allograft usage yielded a shorter length of hospital stay with comparable <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> as autograft. However, for 2 -level patients undergoing ACDF, allograft yielded higher <b>hospital</b> <b>charges</b> at a statistically significant rate, without yielding statistically significant reductions in LOS. As with many issues, the decision as to which graft type to use for ACDF procedures is a multi-factorial issue. Both short and long term cost considerations must be heavily weighed. The limitations of our study must also be weighed against our conclusions. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
