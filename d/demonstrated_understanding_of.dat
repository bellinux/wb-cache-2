40|$|Congenital {{cytomegalovirus}} (cCMV) infections {{cause more}} {{children to have}} permanent disabilities than Down Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Spina Bifida, and pediatric HIV/AIDS combined. The risk of infection during pregnancy can be significantly decreased using universal precautions, such as thorough handwashing and cleansing of surfaces and objects that have {{come into contact with}} infected body fluids. Children under 3 years of age are commonly asymptomatic excretors of CMV, with the highest viral loads present in saliva. Pediatric therapists have regular close contact with young children, and are thus likely at elevated occupational risk of acquiring CMV. Our objective was to evaluate therapist knowledge of cCMV and its transmission. We recruited American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) and American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) members via electronic newsletters and printed flyers from April to September 2015. Participants completed an online, anonymous 24 -question survey using Survey Monkey. We compared responses between groups and previously published CMV awareness data using binomial tests of difference of proportions and multiple logistic regression. Our study identified both a low level of therapist awareness and poor <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> cCMV. Self-reported cCMV awareness amongst therapists was greater than awareness in the general population, and equivalent to awareness amongst health care professionals. Whereas 52 % of participants self-reported awareness of cCMV, only 18 % <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the behavioral modes of CMV transmission. Fewer therapists reported awareness of cCMV than other, less prevalent conditions. Higher levels of health risk knowledge were associated with greater contact with children. Most participants reported learning about cCMV from the workplace. The knowledge gaps between self-reported awareness of cCMV and <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> modes of transmission described by our results emphasize the need for additional training of therapists. cCMV is preventable, and accurate knowledge of modes of transmission is crucial for the health of practitioners and clients...|$|E

A number of behavioral techniques, including extinction of tantrum behaviors, reinforcement of compliant bedtime, {{and implementation of}} consistent bedtime routines {{have been successful in}} improving bedtime compliance. The present study examined the effects of the ‘‘Mystery Motivator’’ (MM), a behavioral contract designed to remediate bedtime problems by delivering random reinforcement. Emphasis was placed on the optimal use of clinical intervention by enlisting parents as primary change agents in the home setting. Three adults and their four children, aged 3 - 5 years, participated. Three of the four children showed substantial changes in both time out of bed and bedtime noncompliance between baseline and treatment phases. A fourth child showed less improvement. Parent participants <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the materials and successfully implemented the home program.

40|$|Background: People with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) {{are more likely}} to have health problems than people without disability. Little previous research has investigated health from the perspective of the people with ID themselves. We aimed to focus on what people with ID understand being healthy to mean and what their experiences are of healthy lifestyles. Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 adults with ID to ask them about their health and healthy lifestyles. Data were analysed thematically. Results: Participants <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> what it means to be healthy, have a healthy diet, the dangers of substance misuse, and the benefits of exercise. Participants demonstrated some knowledge about rationales for engaging in healthy behaviours. The idea of moderation was raised, along with barriers and facilitators to engaging in a healthy lifestyle. Conclusions: Findings suggest that people with ID demonstrate some understanding of what constitutes being healthy and are aware of healthy lifestyles, the consequences of unhealthy behaviours, and of the need for moderation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Danish {{dialogue}} {{particles are}} nine optional, non-focusable monomorphemic words which point to intersubjective configurations of shared knowledge, conflicting perspectives, or different balances in knowledge states. Acquisition of the particles requires sophisticated perspective-taking skills as {{children must be}} able to represent a proposition from both their own and another person’s perspective simultaneously. A comparison of results from 164 Danish children and 60 adults on a gap-filling test with three of the particles suggests that most 11 -to- 14 -year-olds follow adult-like usage norms for these three particles. The children <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the complex meaning of each individual particle and sensitivity {{to the ways in which}} constellations of character perspectives shifted in the narratives. A comparison with the performance of Danish same-age, verbal children with autism, known to have difficulties with taking others’ perspective, showed that the children with autism chose the most appropriate dialogue particle in the test significantly less often than the typically developing children. The results confirm the semantic analysis of the particles and the cognitive-functional view of language as reflecting cognitive predispositions and communicative requirements...|$|E
40|$|The Chief Nursing Officer’s {{recent review}} {{of mental health}} nursing called for the {{widespread}} involvement of mental health service users {{in the education of}} mental health nurses. This paper describes an innovative project that involved mental health service users in the education of pre-registration mental health nursing students through an online discussion forum that blended e-learning with enquiry-based learning (EBL). The findings of an evaluation are presented, drawing on quantitative and qualitative methods. Overall, the project was a success with students and service users engaging in online discussions on a range of issues. EBL presentations <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the service user experience and students reflected on implications for clinical practice. All participants would take part again and recommend the online forum to others. Analysis of activity data revealed different levels and styles of student involvement. Limitations in communication skills appeared to limit student participation, alongside logistical difficulties, whereas the service users eagerly utilised the forum. Potential implications for healthcare education are discussed and recommendations made for developments in user-led e-learning and further research...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been a {{tradition}} in interaction design to involve users in order to better capture user needs and preferences. The involvement of children as informants and design partners is well documented for interaction design but its use in serious games design is much less reported. Where children are contributing to the design of learning materials their knowledge may be incomplete. This paper reports on the organisation of, and the deliverables from, a participatory design activity with children in which they were charged with designing a game for children in another continent. The study found that children predominantly focussed on the learning aspects of the serious game during their design activities but they were also able to consider some of the game aspects. They <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> instruction but were less aware of some of the other aspects of learning including feedback on understanding. Involving children {{in the design of the}} serious game lead to some nice insights that were included in the game that was subsequently built and shipped. Taking Müller’s third place in HCI as inspiration, the paper concludes with some reflection for how to involve children in serious game design...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} which combines robotics and science education through inquiry into natural phenomena {{and development of}} their robotic representations. The physical models are constructed using the PicoCricket robot kit. The approach is implemented and evaluated {{in the framework of}} a teacher training course for Technion students (prospective teachers) given in connection with outreach courses for {{middle school and high school}} students. The educational follow-up study utilized qualitative methods including personal interviews, analogical thinking and attitude questionnaires, videotaped and transcribed observations. The data indicated that the proposed approach facilitated acquisition of both technology and science concepts and inspired interdisciplinary connections by exploring analogies and contrasts between the two fields. The findings reveal characteristics of robotic model building activity necessary for representations of processes in nature, and in particular, the need to place the model construction activity in the hands of the students. Data collected indicated that prior to course, the prospective teachers had little knowledge regarding models and lack of experience in their application. At the end of the course they <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the advantages and challenges of teaching with models as well as motivation to build models and teach using models...|$|E

40|$|In many countries, {{legislation}} and policy directives increasingly emphasize {{the rights of}} parents to participate in child protection decision-making. As these kinds of initiatives have become more widespread, literature has tended to presume that increased participation of parents in child protection practice is both feasible and desirable. However, despite demonstrated benefits of parents 2 ̆ 7 participation, factors related to the statutory context of child protection work present challenges to translating the ideals of participation into reality. Findings from in-depth interviews with 28 child and family welfare practitioners indicate that effective parent participation is contingent {{on a range of}} parent and system factors. Parent factors include parents 2 ̆ 7 willingness to engage with child welfare authorities, their <b>demonstrated</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> their children 2 ̆ 7 s needs, and their willingness to effect parenting changes in order to meet these needs. System factors relate {{to the power of the}} child protection system in relation to parents, and the extent to which workers have time for thorough case planning and for building relationships with parents. These factors are clearly interrelated, with some parent factors themselves contingent on parents 2 ̆ 7 prior experiences of the child protection system.
