5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{nickname}} of 'Tug' reputedly {{comes from}} an incident when he repeatedly ordered a battleship {{to try to come}} alongside, and <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> offered her captain a tug to assist. He was also known as 'Old 'Ard 'Art' for his refusal to consider the cares and comforts of officers and men.|$|E
500|$|After Singh {{returned}} from India in 1909, {{she joined the}} Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) {{at the behest of}} Una Dugdale, a friend of the Pankhurst sisters; Emmeline Pankhurst had co-founded the Women's Franchise League in 1889. In 1909 Singh pioneered the movement for women's voting rights, funding suffragette groups and leading the cause. She refused to pay taxes, frustrating the government; King George V asked <b>in</b> <b>exasperation,</b> [...] "Have we no hold on her?" ...|$|E

500|$|At {{an early}} {{show at the}} Railway Tavern in Harrow, Townshend smashed his guitar after accidentally {{breaking}} it. When the audience demanded he do it again, Moon kicked over his drum kit. Subsequent live sets culminated in what the band later described as [...] "auto-destructive art," [...] in which band members (particularly Moon and Townshend) elaborately destroyed their equipment. Moon developed a habit of kicking over his drums, claiming that he did so <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> at an audience's indifference. Townshend later said, [...] "A set of skins is about $300 [...] and after every show he'd just go bang, bang, bang and then kick the whole thing over." ...|$|E
500|$|By general {{critical}} consent the libretto of [...] {{is a work}} of poor quality. The weak plot, as Bizet's biographer Winton Dean observes, {{turns on}} the unlikely coincidence regarding Leila's necklace, and no real effort is made in the text to bring any of the characters to life: [...] "They are the regulation sopranos, tenors, etc., with their faces blacked". Mina Curtiss, in her book on Bizet, dismisses the text as banal and imitative. Donal Henahan of The New York Times, writing in 1986, said that the libretto [...] "rank right down there with the most appallingly inept of its kind". The writers themselves admitted its shortcomings: Cormon commented later that had they been aware of Bizet's quality as a composer, they would have tried harder. Carré was worried about the weak ending, and constantly sought suggestions for changing it; Curtiss records that <b>in</b> <b>exasperation,</b> the theatre manager Carvalho suggested that Carré burn the libretto. This facetious remark, Curtiss asserts, led Carré to end the opera with the fishermen's tents ablaze as Leila and Nadir make their escape.|$|E

Simon's No Bed for Bacon, Bacon {{constantly}} intrudes on Shakespeare's rehearsals {{and lectures}} him on playwriting technique (with quotations from Bacon's actual works), until Shakespeare <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> asks [...] "Master Bacon: do I write my plays, or do you?" ...|$|E

2500|$|It was Buñuel's {{intention}} to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: [...] "Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what {{in those days}} was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason." [...] Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a huge success amongst the French bourgeoisie, leading Buñuel to exclaim <b>in</b> <b>exasperation,</b> [...] "What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when it goes against their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Learning of {{the unrest}} over the robbery, Smith {{took to the}} streets, {{mingling}} with the residents and merchants, and claiming {{that no one had}} been robbed. Smith argued that Stewart had lost his gold in a square game. Between 2 and 6 PM, “at least a dozen men went to Soapy Smith and {{tried to get him to}} disavow the robbery and give up the men.” Smith, however, maintained his position and “declined to do anything about the matter,” finally stating <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> “that if Stewart had not ‘hollered,’ he [...] would feel like going out and getting him a piece of the money” back. In contrast with the Alaskan, Smith told several businessmen he would make amends.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{described}} Lanrezac as “a big flabby man” with a {{habit of}} hitching his spectacles behind his ear, whilst Sir John, who disliked him, later described him as “a Staff College pedant” with no practical ability at command in war. Sir John had an infamous meeting with Lanrezac at Rethel (17 August), at which he attempted to speak in French, despite {{not being able to}} do so well. When he asked whether the Germans spotted at Huy were crossing the river, his attempt to pronounce the name [...] "Huy" [...] caused Lanrezac to exclaim <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> that the Germans had probably gone there to fish. Not only did they form a mutual dislike, but Sir John also believed Lanrezac was about to advance further, whereas in fact Lanrezac wanted to fall back from his strong position behind the angle of the Rivers Sambre and Meuse, but was forbidden to do so by Joffre. Concerned at having to guard against a German Meuse crossing south of Sedan, at Mezieres, or (most likely) at Namur north of Givet, Lanrezac urged that he be allowed to retreat to Maubeuge to avoid being flanked.|$|E
5000|$|At that time, I {{thought that}} [...] "Pinoy Kasi" [...] would reflect the middle way, {{sometimes}} uttered <b>in</b> despair, <b>exasperation,</b> even shame but also... I {{hoped it would}} be more often said in awe, wonder, and pride.|$|R
60|$|The {{smuggler}} {{uttered the}} last sentence <b>in</b> deep <b>exasperation,</b> for the time appointed for signalising his comrades at sea had arrived, and yet that stolid coast-guard-man sat there {{as if he had}} become fastened to the shingle.|$|R
60|$|The {{vice-consul}} laughed forlornly <b>in</b> his <b>exasperation,</b> but {{he agreed}} with Clementina when she said, in further excuse, that Mrs. Lander was really very sick. He pushed back his hat, and scratched {{his head with a}} grimace.|$|R
2500|$|French met General Charles Lanrezac, {{commanding}} the French Fifth Army on his right, at Rethel (17 August)—they {{were met by}} Lanrezac's Chief of Staff Hely d'Oissel, with the words: [...] "At last you’re here: it’s not a moment too soon. [...] If we are beaten we will owe it to you". They conferred in private {{despite the fact that}} Lanrezac spoke no English and Sir John could speak little French, Wilson being eventually called over to translate. [...] French asked whether the German advance forces spotted at Huy would cross the Meuse River (a reasonable question, as a westward crossing of the Meuse exposed the BEF to encirclement from the west)—his inability to pronounce the name [...] "Huy" [...] caused Lanrezac to exclaim <b>in</b> <b>exasperation</b> that the Germans had probably [...] "come [...] [...] [...] to fish"; French understood the tone but not the meaning, and Wilson tactfully translated that the Germans would indeed cross the river. [...] French informed Lanrezac that his forces would not be ready until 24 August, three days later than promised. [...] The French cavalry under André Sordet, which Sir John had previously asked Joffre in vain to be placed under his command, were further north trying to maintain contact with the Belgians. [...] Sir John, concerned that he had only four infantry divisions rather than the planned six, wanted to keep Allenby's cavalry division in reserve and refused Lanrezac's request that he lend it for reconnaissance in front of the French forces (Lanrezac misunderstood that French intended to use the British cavalry as mounted infantry). [...] French and Lanrezac came away from the meeting with a poor relationship. [...] At the time French wrote in his diary that Lanrezac was [...] "a very capable soldier", although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs 1914. [...] Besides their mutual dislike he believed Lanrezac was about to take the offensive, whereas Lanrezac had in fact been forbidden by Joffre to fall back and wanted the BEF moved back further to clear roads for a possible French retreat.|$|E
