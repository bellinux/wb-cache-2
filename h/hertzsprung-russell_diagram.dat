5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating variable stars. In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
500|$|In astronomy, {{the main}} {{sequence}} is a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appears on plots of stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude plots {{are known as}} <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagrams</b> after their co-developers, Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or [...] "dwarf" [...] stars. These are the most numerous true stars in the universe, and include the Earth's Sun.|$|R

The present review is mainly concerned with radiation which is emitted by 'normal' stars, defined here to include those appearing on classical <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The mechanisms for both steady, quiescent emission and intense, strongly varying outbursts are discussed. Included are discussions of bremsstrahlung, gyrosynchrotron emission, electron-cyclotron masers, and plasma radiation. The manifestation of these mechanisms in various kinds of solar radiation are considered along with stellar manifestations...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{distances}} to star clusters {{can be estimated}} by using a <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> or colour–colour diagram to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of the stars, for example fitting the main sequence or identifying features such as a horizontal branch, and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of 7,330light-years (2,250parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000light-years (2,900±300parsecs).|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagram,</b> it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of large numbers}} of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over the last decade has made it possible to investigate star formation and early evolution in a previously unexplored mass regime. In this review, we begin by describing surveys for low-mass members of nearby associations, open clusters, star-forming regions and the methods used to characterize their stellar properties. We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagrams</b> for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.

50|$|A <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> (H-R) <b>diagram</b> is a {{scatter plot}} of stars with {{temperature}} or spectral type on the x-axis and absolute magnitude or luminosity on the y-axis. H-R diagrams of all stars, show a clear diagonal main sequence band containing {{the majority of}} stars, {{a significant number of}} red giants (and white dwarfs if sufficiently faint stars are observed), with relatively few stars {{in other parts of the}} diagram.|$|R
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a <b>Hertzsprung–Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Early {{calculations}} {{suggested that}} there might be white dwarfs whose luminosity varied with a period of around 10 seconds, but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this., § 7.1.1; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76; in 1965 and 1966, and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12.5 minutes. The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76, like that of the other pulsating variable white dwarfs known, arises from non-radial gravity wave pulsations., § 7. Known types of pulsating white dwarf include the DAV, or ZZ Ceti, stars, including HL Tau 76, with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA;, pp.891, 895 DBV, or V777 Her, stars, with helium-dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB;, p.3525 and GW Vir stars (sometimes subdivided into DOV and PNNV stars), with atmospheres dominated by helium, carbon, and oxygen. GW Vir stars are not, strictly speaking, white dwarfs, but are stars which are in a position on the <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagram</b> between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region. They may be called pre-white dwarfs. These variables all exhibit small (1%–30%) variations in light output, arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds. Observation of these variations gives asteroseismological evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs.|$|E

Non-LTE model {{atmosphere}} calculations {{have been}} used to estimate effective temperatures (from either the helium spectrum or the silicon ionization equilibrium) and gravities (from the hydrogen spectrum).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA {{statistical analysis of}} the "Second Catalog of Emission- Line Stars of the Orion Population" was undertaken. After {{the reduction of the}} Catalog to numeric data, statistics and frequency distributions were systematically searched for any physically significant characteristics. Those two-way frequency distributions with possible physical significance were analyzed. Distance moduli for 228 stars were tabulated. <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagrams</b> were plotted. The T Tauri stars, so plotted, lie between the main sequence and giant branch. A lack of correlation between the large scale variability and any other set of observed characteristics was discovered.

It is argued, that on the basis of current data, no conclusion can be reached as to whether T Tauri stars are on convective or radiative equilibrium tracks approaching the main sequence.

40|$|The {{age of the}} universe, {{measured}} from the Big Bang to the present, is at the focus of cosmology. Its determination relies, however, {{on the use of}} stellar objects or their products. Stellar explosions, like type Ia supernovae serve as standard(izable) candles to measure the expansion of the universe. <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagrams</b> of globular clusters can determine the age of such clusters and thus are lower limits of the age of the galaxy and therefore also the universe. Some nuclear isotopes with half-lives comparable to the age of galaxies (and the universe) can serve as clocks (chronometers) for the duration of nucleosynthesis. The isotopes U- 238 and Th- 232 with half-lives of 4. 5 x 10 (9) and 1. 4 x 10 (10) yr, decaying via alpha decay chains to Pb isotopes, are well suited to serve this purpose. They are products of the same nucleosynthesis process, the r-process. Therefore, the present paper aims at understanding the necessary environment conditions in the (stellar) production sites, the nuclear physics involved, the observational constraints for r-process nucleosynthesis, the results from nucleocosmochronology, and the remaining challenges and uncertainties which need to be overcome for a full {{understanding of the nature of}} the r-process...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-quality}} CMDs of three star clusters, NGC 1831, NGC 1868 and NGC 2249 in detail, via {{the two most}} likely causes (stellar rotation and age spread) for CMDs with extended main-sequence turn-offs. The results show evident failure of stellar rotation (including resolved and unresolved binary stars) to interpret the CMDs of three star clusters, and the unexpected success of age spread. In particular, the special structures of turn-off and red clump parts cannot be generated by stellar rotation, but age spread perfectly reproduces the observed features. This suggests that these three clusters contain multiple populations of stars, rather than a single population of rotating stars and binaries. The thick subgiant branch of NGC 1831 gives the strongest support to this. The results demonstrate that stellar rotation cannot save the widely accepted view (simple population) of star clusters, and an extended star formation history is needed for explaining the observed CMDs. In addition, this work shows that a narrow subgiant branch does not correspond to a simple population. The judgement of simple population in NGC 1651 by a previous work is not necessarily reliable. We anticipate our assay to be {{a starting point for}} more precise study of <b>Hertzsprung-Russell</b> <b>diagrams</b> of star clusters.

We vet these relations via full fits to the full broadband spectral energy distributions for a subset of benchmark stars, and perform quality checks against the large set of stars for which spectroscopically-determined parameters are available from LAMOST, RAVE, and/or APOGEE. We then estimate radii for the 355, 502 Tycho- 2 stars in our sample whose Gaia DR 1 parallaxes are precise to ≲ 10 %. For the 64, 960 of these stars with external spectroscopic information, we achieve median uncertainties on the effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, angular diameters, and radii of 1. 0 %, 1. 4 %, 2. 4 %, and 7. 5 %, respectively.
