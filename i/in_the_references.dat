5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return from the dead. The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>references</b> of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E

5000|$|A {{foreign key}} {{is a field}} in a {{relational}} table that matches the primary key column of another table. The foreign key {{can be used to}} cross-reference tables. Foreign keys do not need to have unique values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation. Foreign keys effectively use the values of attributes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation.A foreign key could be described formally as: [...] "For all tuples <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> relation projected over <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> attributes, there must exist a tuple <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> relation projected over those same attributes such that <b>the</b> values <b>in</b> each of <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> attributes match <b>the</b> corresponding values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> attributes." ...|$|R

50|$|Multiple rows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> (or child) table may {{refer to}} <b>the</b> same row <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> (or parent) table. <b>In</b> this case, <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between the two tables is called a one to many relationship between <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table and <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table.|$|R
50|$|A table (called <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table) {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) <b>in</b> another table (<b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table) by using a foreign key. <b>The</b> <b>referenced</b> column(s) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are {{possible}} (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> table, <b>the</b> relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table. If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table to <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> tables), NO ACTION (if the specific row is <b>referenced,</b> changing <b>the</b> key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>referenced</b> table results <b>in</b> setting <b>the</b> <b>referencing</b> values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|R

A classical introduction for graduate students or advanced undergraduates is Rolfsen (1976), given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>references.</b> Other good texts from the references are Adams (2001) and Lickorish (1997). Adams is informal and accessible for the most part to high schoolers. Lickorish is a rigorous introduction for graduate students, covering a nice mix of classical and modern topics.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{generally}} consider Tacitus's {{reference to}} the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate to be both authentic, and of historical value as an independent Roman source about early Christianity that is in unison with other historical records. William L. Portier has stated that the consistency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>references</b> by Tacitus, Josephus and the letters to Emperor Trajan by Pliny the Younger reaffirm the validity of all three accounts.|$|E
25|$|The RAF's {{airborne}} systems {{moved the}} antennas {{by moving the}} entire aircraft. In the case of GL, the bearing angle was already movable {{through the use of}} the rotating cabin. One solution to moving the elevation angle would be to have the vertical pole tilt, but for reasons that are not recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>references,</b> this solution was not used. Instead, the upper antenna of the vertical pair was able to be moved up and down the ladder-like extension.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{documented}} that Llull was buried at the Church of Saint Francis in Mallorca by March 1316. Riber {{states that the}} circumstances of his death remain a mystery. Zwemer, a Protestant missionary and academic, accepted the story of martyrdom, as did an article in the Catholic Encyclopedia published in 1911 (see links <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>References</b> section). Bonner gives as a reason for Llull's journey to Tunis the information that its ruler was interested in Christianity—false information given to the Kings of Sicily and Aragon and relayed to Llull.|$|E
30|$|To {{calculate}} {{recall and}} precision, we considered that true positives are instances (classes or methods) present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> code smell <b>reference</b> list {{that are also}} reported by the tool being assessed. False positives are instances that are not present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> list, but they were reported by the tool. False negatives are instances present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> list that were not reported by the tool. Finally, true negatives are instances that are not present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> list and were also not reported by the tool. Therefore, recall {{is the number of}} true positives divided by the number of instances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> list (true positives + false negatives), while precision <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of true positives divided by the number of instances reported by the tool (true positives + false positives).|$|R

Magnetization changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> layer can be probed by measuring minor MR loops.
