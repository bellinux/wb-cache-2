5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema {{had to rely on}} its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Korall radar-jammers were {{mounted on}} <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mainmast}} {{as well as}} a Machta system on the foremast. Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system. A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E

5|$|The Watermill at Opwetten is {{situated}} {{along the river}} Kleine Dommel. Diverted river water flows along a channel with force to drive two wooden undershot water wheels, connected to two buildings on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw.

50|$|Located {{just south}} of Cardigan, between Llechryd Bridge and the Teifi Marshes in Ceredigion, Coedmor National Nature Reserve is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most picturesque in Wales.

5|$|A single large {{opening on}} <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it {{from most of the}} {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges {{on the inside of the}} nasal cavity and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E

5|$|Even so, {{and partly}} because of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, {{as part of}} {{the review}} of the defences of Singapore against threats from European powers in the region, it was decided that forts be built on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} to New Harbour. Fort Pasir Panjang was built on Labrador and Fort Siloso on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa). It was found that the steep cliffs and thick mangrove swamps surrounding the two forts acted as an ideal natural barrier to intruders.|$|E
