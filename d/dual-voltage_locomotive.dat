5000|$|... #Caption: British Class 92 92001 cross-channel <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{under test}} in November 1994.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} get an idea of how to realise the first [...] "real" [...] <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>{{locomotive}},</b> the damaged BB16540 locomotive was rebuilt in 1959 to dual-voltage and renumbered BB20004.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} electrified at 20 kV AC (50 Hz) and was changed in 2016 to the Shinkansen-standard 25 kV AC (50 Hz). For operation on the line, JR Freight introduced Class EH800 <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|Next to {{its present}} AC {{equipment}}, a small DC equipment {{was built in}} to operate under 1.5 kV, however with limited power. Although BB20004 is generally considered the prototype of the BB25500 locomotives this is not entirely true. BB25500 locomotives are based on BB16500 locomotives for the greater part, but some equipments were either parts which were not used on BB16500 locomotives but on older locomotives, or entirely new designs. BB20004 contributed however a big part to the realisation of the BB25500 and later <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> and expanded the knowledge of <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> greatly.|$|R

50|$|After {{successful}} {{tests with}} BB20004, prototype of BB25500 locomotives, another {{new series of}} <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> was ordered by SNCF: the BB25150 and BB25200 series.These had a higher power than their predecessors, {{and in order to}} test the new parts and technology it was decided to rebuild a BB16000 <b>locomotive</b> into <b>dual-voltage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} three dual-voltage locomotives, which were only meant to operate on Aix-Annecy and got 1.5kV equipment for the purposes described above, this locomotive can be considered the first [...] "real" [...] SNCF <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{train was}} formed of 14 series {{sleeping}} cars based at JR East's Oku Depot in Tokyo, typically consisting of 8 cars. The train was hauled by a JR East Nagaoka-based EF64-1000 DC electric locomotive between Ueno and Nagaoka, where the train reversed, {{and by a}} JR East Nagaoka-based EF81 <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive</b> between Nagaoka and Kanazawa.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} uses Toshiba-made 3-phase AC motors, powered through Insulated-gate {{bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) control. It is a <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive,</b> designed {{to operate on}} either 3 kV DC or 25 kV AC. Like the earlier Classes 7E1, 7E4, 9E, 11E, 15E and 18E electric locomotives, these engines have driving cabs at one end only since they would only be utilised in multi-unit consists.|$|E

50|$|On {{electrified}} {{lines the}} services {{were to be}} hauled by Class 92 locomotives. These locomotives were built and designed as multipowered electric units for this role as well as hauling Channel Tunnel freight services. They are <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> able to operate on 750 V DC lines (as in the South-East of England) and 25 kV AC lines (for beyond London, through the Channel Tunnel and in Europe).|$|R
5000|$|With {{electrification}} of {{the mayor}} European axes pending in the late-1950s, SNCF engineers dreamed of a locomotive type which could operate of all 4 major European currents: 1.5 kV DC, 3 kV DC, [...] and [...] Unfortunately, the technology to develop such kinds of locomotives wasn't advanced enough at that time. Therefore, the engineers stuck {{to the idea of}} realizing a reliable series of <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive</b> first.|$|E
50|$|The SNCF Class BB 7200 is a 1.5 kV DC {{electric}} locomotive {{operated by the}} SNCF in France. It is the DC version of the 'Nez Cassé' family of locomotives. SNCF Class BB 15000 is the AC version while the Class BB 22200 is a dual-voltage version. They are numbered {{to show that the}} DC and AC class numbers add up to the <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotive</b> class number (7200 + 15000 = 22200). Another relative is the NS Class 1600 operated in the Netherlands, a DC locomotive based on the BB 7200.|$|E
50|$|The first railway to {{use this}} system was {{completed}} in 1951 by SNCF between Aix-les-Bains and La Roche-sur-Foron in southern France, initially at 20 kV but converted to 25 kV in 1953. The 25 kV system was then adopted as standard in France, but since substantial amounts of mileage south of Paris had already been electrified at 1,500 V DC, SNCF also continued some major new DC electrification projects, until <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> were developed in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|SNCF {{had already}} experimented {{with three other}} <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>{{locomotive}}s</b> in the 1950s, but these were all rebuilt from a DC locomotive and could only deliver their full power under 25 kV. Power output under 1.5 kV was reduced to 10% of the full power which is nearly negligible. This was however no real problem, as these locomotives operated only on Aix-les-Bains - Annecy and only needed the 1.5kV DC to pull trains into the station of Aix-les-Bains or to drive to their depot in Chambéry.|$|R
50|$|The {{train was}} formed of twelve E26 series {{sleeping}} cars, including a lounge {{car at the}} Sapporo end and a deluxe suite at the Ueno end. The train was hauled by a JR East Tabata-based Class EF510-500 <b>dual-voltage</b> electric <b>locomotive</b> between Ueno and Aomori, by a JR Hokkaido ED79 AC electric locomotive between Aomori and Hakodate, and {{by a pair of}} JR Hokkaido DD51 diesel locomotives between Hakodate and Sapporo. Prior to June 2010, the services were hauled by JR East Class EF81 <b>dual-voltage</b> electric <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{modernisation}} of the Zagreb-Belgrade railway line an electrification system of 25 kV/50 Hz was used. Electrification on other lines in Croatia was then made exclusively 25 kV/50 Hz. Later, {{the majority of}} the Zagreb - Rijeka line was re-electrified to 25 kV/50 Hz, but until December 2012 there was still a part that under 3 kV DC. Consequentially a power system break existed at Moravice. HŽ was considering the purchase of <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives,</b> as an alternative to full re-electrification of 3 kV DC tracks, but the idea was scrapped for good as all electrified railways in Croatia are now using 25 kV/50 Hz.|$|R
50|$|The SNCF class BB 20004 <b>locomotive</b> was a <b>dual-voltage</b> {{test-bed}} <b>locomotive</b> {{transformed from}} the damaged BB16540 in 1959. After {{the end of}} its test period in 1969 it was reinstated with its original equipment under its original number BB16540.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow Hokkaido Shinkansen {{services}} to operate through the dual-gauge Seikan Tunnel (which commenced on 26 March 2016), the overhead line system voltage was raised from the narrow gauge standard of 20 kV AC to the standard shinkansen power supply of 25 kV AC. A fleet of approximately 20 new <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> capable of operating under either 20 kV or 25 kV was therefore required to replace the Class ED79 and Class EH500 locomotives previously used to haul freight and overnight sleeping car services through the tunnel. These locomotives are also compatible with the digital ATC and feature digital train wireless communications. The total cost of manufacturing the fleet of locomotives together with construction of new maintenance depot facilities was approximately 19 billion yen.|$|R
50|$|In early August 2013 {{the first}} of ninety-five Class 20E <b>dual-voltage</b> {{electric}} <b>locomotives</b> for Transnet Freight Rail was lowered onto its bogies for the first time. Ten of these locomotives were built by the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Company in China while the rest were built locally.|$|R
50|$|The train {{used to be}} hauled between Ueno and Aomori by a JR East Tabata-based Class EF81 <b>dual-voltage</b> {{electric}} <b>locomotive,</b> however from July 2010 {{this work}} {{was taken over by}} the Class EF510-500. Until its removal from service in 2001, ED76-551 hauled the Hokutosei between Aomori and Hakodate. It was subsequently replaced by the Class ED79.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, SBB Cargo had 7360 {{freight wagons}} in service (of which 6677 were low-noise vehicles). SBB Cargo {{purchased}} 50 Re 482 <b>dual-voltage</b> freight <b>locomotives</b> for its Switzerland-Germany services, 15 {{of which can}} also be operated in Austria. SBB Cargo uses <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> for its Switzerland-Italy services: 21 Re 484 locomotives and 12 Re 474 locomotives. In total, 495 traction vehicles were in service during 2013. For its freight services in Switzerland and Germany, SBB Cargo uses 45 Am 843 diesel shunters with environment-friendly soot particle filters. These locomotives help improve the production efficiency of heavy shunting operations and are equipped with radio remote-control systems. The Biel works uses an additional 45 modernised Tm IV shunting tractors. After the refit, the shunting tractors will be classified as type Tm 232.In summer 2010, SBB Cargo ordered 30 new two-axle hybrid locomotives (type Eem 923 Hybrid) from Stadler Winterthur AG to replace the Bm 4/4 shunting locomotives and various three-axle shunting locomotives used for light freight duties for wagonload traffic, since the old locomotives no longer met current requirements in terms of age, cost-effectiveness and performance. The newly developed model {{is based on the}} Ee 922 shunting locomotive which SB already uses for shunting duties in its Passenger division. The hybrid version for SBB Cargo has an electric motor and an auxiliary diesel engine for use on non-electrified sidings. The Eem 923 hybrid has a maximum speed of 120 km/h. In late February 2014, the last of the Eem 923 locomotives to be ordered was christened “Chestenberg” in Lupfig and put into operation.18.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail Class 92 is a <b>dual-voltage</b> {{electric}} <b>locomotive</b> {{which can}} run on 25 kV AC from overhead wires or 750 V DC {{from a third}} rail. It was designed specifically to operate services through the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France. Eurotunnel indicates the Class 92 locomotive as the reference for other locomotives which railway undertakings might want to get certified for usage in the Channel tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|Little {{groups of}} armed {{soldiers}} stand about. I'm reminded {{that people were}} shot on this frontier not many weeks before. The train is taken over by an army of workmen, tapping wheels, climbing over bogies and, in the carriages, peering into ceiling cavities and shining torches under the seats. My passport is checked four times and finally stamped with a multi-coloured seal of approval. A girl scuttling about the compartments with an official briefcase demands to know if I have Hungarian money, and scuttles away again before I {{have a chance to}} answer. — Eric Robson, [...] "Changing Trains", in Great Railway Journeys of the World (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1981) In May 1988, the Lehár was added to the EuroCity network. [...] The time required for the border crossing was shortened to ten minutes, due to the introduction of <b>dual-voltage</b> <b>locomotives</b> that {{did not need to be}} changed at the border, and onboard passport and customs inspections. The overall travel time from Vienna to Budapest was reduced to just three hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{train was}} formed of 24 series {{sleeping}} cars based at JR East's Oku Depot in Tokyo and JR Hokkaido's Sapporo Depot, typically consisting of 12 cars including a KaNi24 generator car. From Ueno to Aomori {{the train was}} hauled by a JR East Class EF510-500 <b>dual-voltage</b> electric <b>locomotive,</b> by a JR Hokkaido Class ED79 AC electric locomotive between Aomori and Hakodate, and {{by a pair of}} JR Hokkaido Class DD51 diesel locomotives between Hakodate and Sapporo.|$|R
50|$|The WCAM 3 class {{locomotives}} are {{in service}} in the Mumbai region’s Central Railway zone. The <b>dual-voltage</b> WCAM series <b>locomotives</b> haul intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region on Central Railways which is on a 1500V DC overhead system, as opposed {{to other parts of}} India which have 25000 V AC overhead.|$|R
50|$|Services {{remained}} stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but {{the opening of}} the Ligne-a-Grande-Vitesse Nord in 1993 started a cascade of assignments in which the BB15000's lost services to either <b>dual-voltage</b> BB26000 <b>locomotives</b> or to TGV trains. Yet BB15000 locomotives remained strong in the northeast and pulled strongly-promoted Corail Téoz services between Paris and Strasbourg from 2003 until mid-2005, when half of the loco-hauled services were converted to TGV trainsets, albeit still running on the classic line. In mid-2006 the remainder were also converted into TGV services, leaving only some TER trains for the Lorraine and Alsace regions, and the EuroCity trains between Basel and Brussels (loco change at Luxemburg) or Paris and Frankfurt (loco change at Strasbourg).|$|R
5000|$|WCAM (W -broad gauge CA -Both DC and AC M -for both {{goods and}} {{passenger}} service) is the dual-power AC/DC series locomotive used by Indian Railways. These locomotives can run under both DC traction and AC traction. All the WCAM locos except the WCAM 1 (made by CLW) {{were made by}} BHEL. They have 750 V DC traction motors, using resistance banks in DC mode and a variable ratio auto-transformer with rectifier units in AC mode, for power control. The WCAM class locomotives were in service only in the Mumbai region. The <b>dual-voltage</b> WCAM series <b>locomotives</b> hauled intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region which was on a 1500 V DC overhead system, as opposed {{to other parts of}} India which have 25000 V AC overhead.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s {{both the}} West German state {{railways}} (DB) and the Belgian state railways (SNCB) started planning for electrification. Belgium was committed to a 3 Kw DC network while the Germans had opted for a 15 Kw AC power supply. At this stage <b>dual-voltage</b> and multi-voltage <b>locomotives</b> were far from mainstream in Europe, which imposed a greater level of inflexibility on decisions about where to change power supply systems and locomotives. In the end the decision was taken that for trains operating along the line from Liege to Aachen, switching of the power supply and locomotives should be centralised some distance inside Germany, at Aachen, where the equivalent switch would also be made for trains coming from the Netherlands. An added advantage of choosing Aachen was that many international passenger trains were already held up there while being reconfigured, as blocks of carriages from the directions of Rotterdam and Brussels were split or merged for the next part of their journeys across Germany. Where this happened there was little or no incremental time-cost involved in switching locomotives at the same time. Work began on electrification of main lines in 1961, and this immediately involved some of the international trains headed towards Brussels and Ostend being rerouted onto the Montzen Route to the north, thereby avoiding Herbesthal completely. Passenger services along the branch line to the east, via Eupen to Raeren in Germany had already been ended on 28 March 1959, so that by 1961 Herbethal had also lost its function as an interchange station.|$|R
