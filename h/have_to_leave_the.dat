5|$|Springfield {{starts to}} harass and hate all immigrants. At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu confides in Homer {{that he is}} an illegal immigrant. Apu {{explains}} that if Proposition 24 passes, he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> United States, as his visa expired many years earlier. Apu is forced to go to Fat Tony to obtain a false United States citizenship. However, feeling guilty and embarrassed about taking the fraudulent route, he realizes he has disgraced his parents by turning his back on his Indian heritage, and tears up the fake passport.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> slate behind if they want to climb a ladder.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston was not exiled immediately; {{he did not}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> realm until 25 June, but faced excommunication by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, {{should he}} return. Edward used the {{intervening}} period to provide for his favourite's continued prosperity and political importance. As a compensation {{for the loss of}} the earldom of Cornwall, which was another condition of the exile, Gaveston was granted land worth 3,000 marks annually in Gascony, and land amounting to the same value in England. Further to this, he was appointed the King's Lieutenant of Ireland, so that a certain amount of honour could be maintained despite the humiliation of the exile. The appointment came the day after Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, had been given the same position, indicating that it was an improvised measure. Gaveston's appointment came with wider authority than Ulster's, however, for he had full regal powers to appoint and dismiss any royal officers.|$|E

25|$|As Geldof {{began to}} learn more about the situation, he {{discovered}} that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was because of repayments on loans that their countries had taken from Western banks.

25|$|The Republic of Ireland Act {{came into}} force on 18 April 1949.

25|$|There is no {{official}} state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support {{at least one}} of the three traditional denominations—Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant—with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3%) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.|$|E

25|$|Kyary {{was raised}} in a {{traditional}} strict household, where her parents frequently set early curfews and limited her cell phone access. Her mother was very critical of her fashion sense, to the point where Kyary would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> house dressed normally, and change into Harajuku-style clothing inside a public restroom. She would often return home to find that her mother had disposed of her fashion accessories, which led to further quarrels. She writes in her autobiography, Oh! My God!! Harajuku Girl that her father was more supportive of her, although they had their fair share of quarrels as well.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe would tell them to return home to their wives and families.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and was very disappointed to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.|$|E
25|$|In the 1800s the {{continental}} railway system was greatly expanded. In 1897 construction opened on a spur {{line of the}} Santa Fe Railroad, which was to lead directly to the Grand Canyon; by 1901 the line was open. During {{his visit to the}} Grand Canyon in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt met two Havasupais at Indian Garden. Roosevelt told them about the park that was being created, and that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> area. In 1908 the Grand Canyon was declared a national monument, and by 1919 it had received National Park status. However, it was not until 1928 that the Havasupai finally left Indian Garden, forced out by the National Park Service.|$|E
25|$|On the October 2 {{edition of}} Nitro, Vince Russo, an {{authority}} figure, made Bill Goldberg begin an undefeated streak. If Goldberg exceeded his previous streak of over 170 matches, {{he would be}} awarded {{a shot at the}} WCW World Heavyweight Championship. If he failed to do so, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> company. Goldberg continued his streak, and Lex Luger challenged him on the October 30 edition of Nitro, starting their feud. Goldberg defeated Luger in a match at Mayhem. A rematch was made between them at Starrcade, and Luger attacked Goldberg on the following shows with a steel chair. The Sarge, who was credited for training Goldberg, also joined the feud, and aligned with Goldberg. Luger attacked The Sarge several times to taunt Goldberg.|$|E
