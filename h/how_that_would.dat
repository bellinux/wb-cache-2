The competition, held by the administration of Michael Bloomberg, expanded the idea of the pilot project. There were 125 responses that suggested a Wi-Fi network, but none of these responses elaborated on <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be accomplished.|$|E

After this, slaves brought to the state were immediately considered freed. Seward also signed legislation to establish public education for all children, leaving it up to local jurisdictions as to <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be supplied (some had segregated schools).|$|E
500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It never occurred to me before <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have an effect on his character [...] to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E

The {{couple have}} no {{children}} and Winter stated in an interview: [...] "I can see <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{be a wonderful}} rewarding thing, but I think there are enough people in the world" [...] and that [...] "It {{might have been more}} problematical if I had children with a career and all of it.

2500|$|Hume said of {{the start}} of his time at Fox that [...] "we made some {{progress}} and developed some audience and the Lewinsky scandal brought a lot of interest and the 2000 election brought a lot of interest, but what really did it was the Florida recount – that was tremendous for us because the people who were worried about <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> come out wanted some place where they could trust the coverage, people who were conservatives or Republicans or neither but worried. And we really made an effort to cover that story well. And that built our audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, in {{the early}} 1840s the state {{legislature}} and Governor William H. Seward expanded rights for free blacks and fugitive slaves in New York: in 1840 the legislature passed laws protecting the rights of African Americans against Southern slave-catchers. One guaranteed alleged fugitive slaves {{the right of a}} jury trial in New York to establish whether they were slaves, and another pledged the aid of the state to recover free blacks kidnapped into slavery, (as happened to Solomon Northup of Saratoga Springs in 1841, who did not regain freedom until 1853.) In 1841 Seward signed legislation to repeal a [...] "nine-month law" [...] that allowed slaveholders to bring their slaves into the state for a period of nine months before they were considered free. After this, slaves brought to the state were immediately considered freed, {{as was the case in}} some other free states. Seward also signed legislation to establish public education for all children, leaving it up to local jurisdictions as to <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be supplied (some had segregated schools).|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s the United States {{provided}} {{global leadership}} by {{acting as the}} [...] "Tip of The Spear" [...] among nations in crafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC. After the United Nations adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other {{nation in the world}} with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention {{is the fact that the}} Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations about <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be tried as an adult in the U.S. courts. Several politicians have said that many of the declarations included in the document are not issues for which the federal government is in charge. There is currently no apparent effort within the federal government to adopt the CRC.|$|E
