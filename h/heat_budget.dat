We evaluated the effect of pavements made of traditional and new materials on water and <b>heat</b> <b>budgets.</b> We expanded the NICE (NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology) model to simulate the water and <b>heat</b> <b>budgets</b> for the various materials and to reproduce the cooling of water-holding pavement (consisting of porous asphalt and water-holding filler made of steel by-products based on a silica compound) by evaporation (NICE-URBAN); the results were compared with those from the simplified empirical model.

Because the model estimates that the air temperature above the water-holding pavement is 1 – 2 °C lower than that above the lawn and 3 – 5 °C lower than that above the building rooftop, this material has a powerful positive cooling effect in combination with a lawn for a passive cooling effect. The simulation of NICE-URBAN showed that the surface temperature decrease in water-holding pavement {{is closely related to}} evaporation from the surface, the water volume of the pavement and the surface reflectance.

40|$|Water vapor {{and ozone}} are {{powerful}} radiative constituents {{in the tropical}} lower stratosphere, impacting the local <b>heating</b> <b>budget</b> and nonlocally forcing the troposphere below. Their near-tropopause seasonal cycle structures imply associated "radiative seasonal cycles" in heating rates that could affect the amplitude and phase of the local temperature seasonal cycle. Overlying stratospheric seasonal cycles of water vapor and ozone could {{also play a role}} in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere <b>heat</b> <b>budgets</b> through nonlocal propagation of radiation. Previous studies suggest that the tropical lower stratospheric ozone seasonal cycle radiatively amplifies the local temperature seasonal cycle by up to 35 %, while water vapor is thought to have a damping effect an order of magnitude smaller. This study uses Aura Microwave Limb Sounder observations and an offline radiative transfer model to examine ozone, water vapor, and temperature seasonal cycles and their radiative linkages in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere. Radiative sensitivities to ozone and water vapor vertical structures are explicitly calculated, which has not been previously done in a seasonal cycle context. Results show that the water vapor radiative seasonal cycle in the lower stratosphere is not sensitive to the overlying water vapor structure. In contrast, about one-third of ozone's radiative seasonal cycle amplitude at 85 hPa is associated with longwave emission above 85 hPa. Ozone's radiative effects are not spatially homogenous: for example, the Northern Hemisphere tropics have a seasonal cycle of radiative temperature adjustments with an amplitude 0. 8 K larger than the Southern Hemisphere tropics.

50|$|Controversy {{over the}} exact nature of mantle {{convection}} makes the linked evolution of Earth's <b>heat</b> <b>budget</b> and the dynamics and structure of the mantle difficult to unravel. There is evidence that the processes of plate tectonics were not active in the Earth before 3.2 billion years ago, and that early Earth's internal heat loss could have been dominated by advection via heat-pipe volcanism. Terrestrial bodies with lower heat flows, such as the Moon and Mars, conduct their internal heat through a single lithospheric plate, and higher heat flows, such as on Jupiter's moon Io, result in advective heat transport via enhanced volcanism, while the active plate tectonics of Earth occur with an intermediate heat flow and a convecting mantle.|$|E
