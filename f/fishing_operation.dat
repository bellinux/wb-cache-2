25|$|Reviews of {{the local}} catches have seemed to show no impact of the <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> on nearby tuna fishing. However, this is not very surprising, as fishery {{operations}} exist nearby with as much as 1000 times the activity.

25|$|Discards are {{the portion}} of a catch of fish which is not {{retained}} on board during commercial fishing operations and is returned, often dead or dying, to the sea. The practice of discarding is driven by economic and political factors; fish which are discarded are often unmarketable species, individuals which are below minimum landing sizes and catches of species which fishermen {{are not allowed to}} land, for instance due to quota restrictions. Discards form part of the bycatch of a <b>fishing</b> <b>operation,</b> although bycatch includes marketable species caught unintentionally. Discarding can be highly variable in time and space as a consequence of changing economic, sociological, environmental and biological factors.|$|E

25|$|Purse seiners {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then {{the bottom of the}} net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners.|$|E
500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, handlines, setlines, drum nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|E

All throughout the decade, preparatory activities were carried out, resulting in small catches of a few tens of tonnes per year. Scientists mapped the locations of krill swarms to determine the best fishing grounds, and engineers developed and improved the equipment necessary to fish and process krill. In 1972, the Soviets set up a permanent fishery in Antarctic waters, landing 7,500 tonnes in 1973 and then expanding quickly. The Japanese began experimental krill <b>fishing</b> <b>operation</b> in the area in 1972 and started full-scale commercial operations in 1975.|$|E

In order to gain a better understanding of the possible economic losses for the Italian NA fishingindustry due to jellyfish impacts, we conducted a survey of fishermen in the city of Chioggia, whichis the main fishing port for the NA basin. The study focused on fishermen’s perceptions about jellyfishblooms in the NA Sea and also investigated whether and how blooms compromised <b>fishing</b> <b>operations.</b> Survey results confirm that blooms have negatively affected <b>fishing</b> <b>operations</b> in the last few decades. We estimate that economic losses due to reduction in fish catches could amount to as much as D 8. 2 million per year for the Italian NA trawling fleet. Other costs on this fleet include additional fuel costs dueto displacement of <b>fishing</b> <b>operations,</b> which could represent an increase in costs of over D 460, 000 peryear. Moreover, during a jellyfish bloom episode it can happen that time has to be spent by fishermento repair nets damaged by jellyfish caught in them, leading to an estimated cost for the trawling fleetand small scale fisheries of over 89, 000 man-hours per year.
