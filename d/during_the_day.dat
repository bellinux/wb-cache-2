5|$|It is {{typically}} nocturnal (active at night), though activity {{may also be}} observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> It generally rests or ruminates <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Territories are marked with dung. The reduced size of the preorbital glands, which are used for scent-marking, could indicate that marking behaviour is not very prominent in this antelope.|$|E

Lindeman and Willie Carter tried out with the team <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery skipped the next day's workout, due to a hip surgery and a hamstring injury suffered during the previous week's OTAs, respectively.

5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> as energy from the sun is required, but <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E

5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation.

5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as using}} holes for breeding, great spotted {{woodpeckers}} roost at night, and sometimes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> in old nest cavities, excavated by other woodpeckers. They will occasionally {{make a new}} roosting hole or use an artificial site such as a nest box.|$|E
