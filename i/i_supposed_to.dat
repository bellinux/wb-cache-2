We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the chord myself.

500|$|Cousy {{turned pro}} and made himself {{available}} for the 1950 NBA draft. [...] The Boston Celtics had just concluded the 1949–50 NBA season with a poor 22–46 win-loss record and had the first draft pick. It was strongly anticipated that they would draft the highly coveted local favorite Cousy. However, coach Red Auerbach snubbed him for center Charlie Share, saying: [...] "Am <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> win, or please the local yokels?" [...] The local press strongly criticized Auerbach, but other scouts were also skeptical about Cousy, viewing him as flamboyant but ineffective. One scout wrote in his report: [...] "The first time he tries that fancy Dan stuff in this league, they'll cram the ball down his throat." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 6 was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the franchise's first spin-off, Mega Man X for Nintendo's newer console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next. After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, so what was <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|E
500|$|The symphony was {{dedicated}} to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, [...] "Who was <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> dedicate it to?" [...] He never sought to explain the symphony {{as a response to}} a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child. [...] Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose. While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to Auschwitz, he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed. Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history: ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaye {{had also}} been deeply {{affected}} by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", in 1969, which became a UK hit for Gaye in 1970.

[...] MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the Liverpool Echo published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a [...] "good story").|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, how am <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> keep singing love songs?" [...] When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do protest music, Gordy cautioned him, [...] "Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far." ...|$|E
