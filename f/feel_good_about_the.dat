50|$|Not {{only did}} the Bears have two first-rounders in 1989, they {{actually}} had three.

On draft day, the Bears selected cornerback Donnell Woolford 11th overall, then spent the 12th pick on Florida defensive end Trace Armstrong. <b>Feeling</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first two picks, and needing additional depth, the Bears traded the 25th pick to the Miami Dolphins for their high second and third-round picks. Additional wheeling and dealing gave the Bears a whopping 20 selections over the Draft's 12 rounds. Eight of those players made the team and contributed. One that did not was ninth-round pick Byron Sanders from Northwestern. Byron's brother Barry had been selected by the Detroit Lions with the third overall selection.In Armstrong, Woolford, and John Roper, a linebacker selected with the second-round pick obtained from Miami, the Bears had their replacements for Wilson, Richardson and Harris. Chicago used the other pick obtained from Miami on offensive lineman Jerry Fontenot.

50|$|In his Nicomachean Ethics, (1095a15 - 22) Aristotle {{says that}} eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is {{significant}} that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘happiness is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture {{the meaning of the}} Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is “a very happy person,” we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with {{the way things are going}} in their life. We mean to imply that they <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way things are going for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.|$|E
