60|$|No {{one will}} pretend that this ideal exists {{at all in}} the haute politique of this country. Our {{national}} claim to political incorruptibility is actually based on exactly the opposite argument; {{it is based on the}} theory that wealthy men in assured positions will have no temptation to financial trickery. Whether the history of the English aristocracy, from the spoliation of the monasteries to the annexation of the mines, entirely supports this theory I am not now inquiring; but certainly it is our theory, that wealth will be a protection against political corruption. The English statesman is bribed not to <b>be</b> bribed. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a silver spoon in his mouth, so that he may never afterwards be found with the silver spoons in his pocket. So strong is our faith in this protection by plutocracy, that we are more and more trusting our empire in the hands of families which inherit wealth without either blood or manners. Some of our political houses are parvenue by pedigree; they hand on vulgarity like a coat of-arms. In the case of many a modern statesman to say that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a silver spoon in his mouth, is at once inadequate and excessive. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a silver knife in his mouth. But all this only illustrates the English theory that poverty is perilous for a politician.|$|R
5|$|Roshan felt {{isolated}} as a child; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> {{an extra}} thumb {{on his right}} hand which led some of his peers to avoid him.

5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E

5|$|One day, Indra, {{the king}} of the Devas (celestial deities), {{disguised}} as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.|$|E
