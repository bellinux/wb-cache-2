25|$|Domestic {{consumption}} {{accounts for}} 7% of water withdrawals in Peru. The {{water and sanitation}} sector in Peru has made significant advances {{in the last two}} decades, including an increase <b>in</b> <b>access</b> to an improved water source from 75% to 82% between 1990 and 2008 and an increase <b>in</b> <b>access</b> to improved sanitation from 54% to 68% during the same period. Progress has also been achieved in the disinfection of drinking water and in wastewater treatment. Despite these advances, water supply and sanitation services in Peru are characterized by low coverage in rural areas (61% for water 36% for sanitation in 2008) and poor quality of service, as well as the precarious financial situation of utilities.|$|E

30|$|Generally speaking, small cells such as femtocells, {{which provide}} {{improved}} radio coverage and throughput by wireless <b>access,</b> operate <b>in</b> three <b>access</b> modes: open access, closed access, and hybrid access. When femtocells work <b>in</b> closed <b>access</b> mode, only registered femtocell user equipments (FUEs) can {{connect to the}} femtocell <b>access</b> point (FAP). <b>In</b> open <b>access</b> mode, all kinds of users {{will be allowed to}} connect to the FAP. <b>In</b> hybrid <b>access</b> mode, registered users and non-registered macro users that satisfy certain constraints can connect to the FAP. Although there already have some researches on femtocells with partially open channels [2], for simplicity, we consider completely closed access mode and completely open <b>access</b> mode <b>in</b> this paper.|$|R
