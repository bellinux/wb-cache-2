25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. <b>Headline</b> <b>inflation</b> in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E

In contrast to reserve requirements, 2 -weeks repo rate of NBS decreases private foreign debt, and this impact is statistically significant.

Moreover, in April 2008 in urban areas, the <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation</b> rate reached 16.4% while food price inflation rate was 22.0%.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the performance of VAR and ARIMA models to forecast Austrian HICP inflation. Additionally, we investigate whether disaggregate modelling of five subcomponents of inflation is superior to specifications of <b>headline</b> HICP <b>inflation.</b> Our modelling procedure is to find adequate VAR and ARIMA specifications that minimise the 12 months out-of-sample forecasting error. The main findings are twofold. First, VAR models outperform the ARIMA models in terms of forecasting accuracy over the longer pro- jection horizon (8 to 12 months ahead). Second, a disaggregated ap- proach improves forecasting accuracy substantially for ARIMA mod- els. In case of the VAR approach the superiority of modelling the five subcomponents instead of just considering <b>headline</b> HICP <b>inflation</b> is demonstrated only over the longer period (10 to 12 months ahead).

40|$|It {{is often}} argued {{that changes in}} {{commodity}} prices can provide a timely signal of future movements in CPI inflation because they are a sensitive leading indicator of global demand conditions. The sharp increase in commodity prices since mid- 2003 has raised concerns about {{whether this is a}} precursor to higher consumer price inflation in regional economies. Our empirical results suggest that changes in non-fuel commodity prices have significant predictive power for <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation</b> for Mainland China and Hong Kong, while changes in energy prices are not significant. The results are the opposite for the US. For Hong Kong, a 1 % increase in non-fuel commodity prices is associated with an increase of 0. 5 percentage points in <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation</b> after two years. This may reflect a correlation between Hong Kong housing prices (and the rental component of the CPI) and global growth. If rents are excluded, the estimate falls by one-fifth, to 0. 4 percentage points. For Mainland China, the relationship between changes in commodity and consumer prices is unstable over the past two decades, reflecting structural changes in the economy and the difficulty in controlling for changes in monetary conditions over the period. Shortening the sample period to post- 1997, a 1 % rise in non-fuel commodity prices is associated with a 0. 4 to 0. 5 percentage-point-increase in future CPI inflation. These estimates are larger relatively to those found in other studies on developed economies, which could be due to several factors, including openness, a relatively large share of food prices in the CPI, and, for the Mainland, the size and commodity intensity of its manufacturing sector. ...|$|R
50|$|An inflationary spike {{occurs when}} a {{particular}} section of the economy experiences a sudden price rise possibly due to external factors. For example, if {{a large amount of}} crop is destroyed, the value of the remaining crop will rise sharply.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has {{emphasized that the}} Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan was forward looking, smoothed interest rates, and focused on core inflation. The semiannual monetary policy reports to U. S. Congress indicate that the measure of inflation used in monetary policy deliberations has also been refined over time: For most of the Greenspan period before 2000, inflation forecasts used {{the consumer price index}} (CPI), but in the early 2000 s, inflation forecasts switched to using the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. Using information contained in Greenbook forecasts, this article estimates two forward-looking Taylor rules that differ only with respect to the measure of inflation used over 1987 : 1 - 2006 : 4. A Taylor rule that is estimated using a time-varying measure of core inflation-CPI until 2000 and PCE thereafter-depicts parameter stability in the Greenspan years, and tracks the actual path of the federal funds rate during the subperiod 2000 : 1 – 2006 : 4, when the measure of inflation used changed. In contrast, a Taylor rule that is estimated using <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation</b> does not depict such parameter stability, and indicates the actual funds rate was too low relative to the level prescribed during the subperiod 2000 : 1 - 2006 : 4, as <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation</b> remained elevated because of the continual rise in oil prices. Moreover, in real time during most of this subperiod, core PCE inflation was much lower than what is indicated by the current vintage data. These results highlight the importance of using real-time information in evaluating historical monetary policy actions. Inflation (Finance); Monetary policy...|$|R

In a May 2011 speech to the Money Marketeers Club in New York City, Bullard said that, “Many of the old arguments in favor of a focus on core inflation have become rotten over the years. It is time to drop the emphasis on core inflation as a meaningful way to interpret the inflation process in the U.S.” And in a May 2011 column in the Southeast Missourian, Bullard wrote that, “The emphasis on core inflation may give the impression that the FOMC {{does not take into account}} some important price changes when making decisions about monetary policy. This is damaging Fed credibility in Main Street America.” Further, although two different price indexes are popular for measuring overall inflation (the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures index), in 2013 Bullard suggested adopting a standard measure that is consistently used to estimate and adjust for inflation that consumers face.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of inflation volatility {{is important to}} Central Banks as it guides their policy initiatives for achieving and maintaining price stability. This paper employs three models from the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) family {{with a view to}} providing a parsimonious approximation to the dynamics of Nigeria’s inflation volatility between 1996 and 2011. Of the competing models, the asymmetric TGARCH (1, 1) provides an appropriate paradigm for explaining the dynamics of headline and core CPI volatilities in Nigeria, while the symmetric GARCH (1, 1) was found to be adequate for food CPI. The results are quite revealing. Firstly, model outcomes indicate high persistence parameters for the core and food CPI, implying that the impacts of inflation shocks on their volatilities die away very slowly. However, the impact of <b>inflation</b> shocks on <b>headline</b> volatility die out rather quickly. Secondly, substantial evidence of asymmetric effect was found for both <b>headline</b> and core <b>inflation</b> types while the contrary was confirmed for food inflation. Thirdly, positive inflationary shocks yielded higher volatilities in <b>headline</b> and core <b>inflation</b> than negative innovations, implying the absence of leverage effect in them.

40|$|This article investigates empirically {{short-term}} dynamics between headline {{and core}} measures of {{consumer price index}} and personal consumption expenditure inflation over three sample periods: 1959 : 1 - 1979 : 1, 1979 : 2 - 2001 : 2, and 1985 : 1 - 2007 : 2. Headline and core inflation measures are co-integrated, suggesting long-run co-movement. However, the ways these two variables adjust {{to each other in}} the short run and generate co-movement have changed across these sample periods. In the pre- 1979 sample period, when a positive gap opens up with <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> rising above core inflation, the gap is eliminated mainly as a result of <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> not reverting and core inflation moving toward <b>headline</b> <b>inflation.</b> These dynamics suggest <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> would be better than core inflation in assessing the permanent component of inflation. In post- 1979 sample periods, however, the positive gap is eliminated as a result of <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> reverting more strongly toward core inflation than core inflation moving toward <b>headline</b> <b>inflation,</b> suggesting core inflation would be better than <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> in assessing the permanent component of inflation.

40|$|What are the {{implications}} of targeting different measures of inflation? We extend a basic theoretical framework of optimal monetary policy under inflation targeting to include several components of CPI inflation ratio, and analyze {{the implications}} of using different measures of inflation as target variable — core inflation, CPI excluding interest rates, and <b>headline</b> CPI <b>inflation.</b> Our main results are the following. (i) Barring the interest rate component, temporary shocks to inflation do not affect optimal monetary policy under any regime. (ii) Indirect (second-round) effects of disturbances on goal variables need to be accounted for properly. Simply excluding seemingly temporary disturbances from the reaction function risks leading to inappropriate policy responses. (iii) It may be optimal to respond to changes in one measure of inflation even if the target is defined in terms of another.

In contrast, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has remained low and stable. Historical data suggest that, since the early 1990 s, <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> has tended to converge toward core inflation. Thus, high inflation is unlikely to persist as long as inflation expectations remain anchored. Recent spikes {{in food and}} energy prices have pushed up <b>headline</b> <b>inflation.</b> Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has remained relatively subdued. Will <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> come back to core inflation when the effects of food and energy prices subside, or will high inflation persist? This issue is important for monetary policymakers because Congress has mandated that the Federal Reserve maintain stability of all prices, including those of food and energy. Since monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, today’s policy changes can affect future inflation. If inflation is expected to remain elevated for a sustained period, then the Fed should act aggressively now to bring inflation down to the long-term objective. However, if the inflation run-up {{turns out to be}} transitory, then overly aggressive policy tightening would likely hinder economic recovery. This Economic Letter examines whether <b>headline</b> <b>inflation</b> converges toward core inflation when the two measures deviate.
