The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E

25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is not that he doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E

500|$|The company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California {{produced}} {{some of the}} equipment. The film {{was reported to be}} the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig. 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion. Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: [...] "Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view– so you <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> Peter Parker feels, you <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets." [...] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they [...] "started making the movie around the time Avatar came out" [...] which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films. Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.|$|E

Backbreaker also received an aggregate score of 57.31% on GameRankings, based upon 21 different media reviews. The game's Euphoria animation system was well liked by reviewers.

500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to make people <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, but not really a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E

This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> {{it was like to be}} there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|Tintin in Tibet is well {{received}} by critics from the comics and literary fields. Farr calls it [...] "exceptional in many respects, standing {{out among the}} twenty-three completed Tintin adventures... an assertion of the incorruptible value of bonds of friendship." [...] Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier laud it as [...] "the ultimate Tintin book", reaching [...] "a degree of perfection, both in its story and in its stunning art, that has rarely been equaled, before or since" [...] and [...] "arguably the best book in the series". They detail the story's many emotional moments: Haddock's willingness to sacrifice his life for Tintin's, Tharkey's return, the tearful reunion of Tintin and his starving friend Chang, the reverence paid to Tintin by the Grand Abbot and the monks, and the Yeti's sadness while watching the departure of his only friend. [...] "For a comic book to handle such powerful emotions, convey them to the readers, and make them <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> the characters are feeling is a rare and precious achievement." [...] Thompson calls it [...] "a book of overwhelming whiteness and purity", saying that the [...] "intensely personal nature of the story made this Hergé's favourite Tintin adventure", adding that if readers wonder whether [...] "the enormous weight [...] lifted from Hergé's shoulders, [...] {{can be seen in}} his next book, The Castafiore Emerald, a masterpiece of relaxation."

Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in?

[...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews.

In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot said Miguel [...] "creates a fluid, dreamscape environment that floats across eras with a connoisseur's discerning {{feel for the}} telling detail." [...] Macpherson wrote in The Guardian of Miguel's occasional [...] "appeal to indie tropes" [...] balanced by [...] "genuinely thoughtful songwriting", while admiring his use of a commercial breakthrough [...] "as a springboard to radically change course". Sean McCarthy from PopMatters wrote that, along with Frank Ocean's Channel Orange, it showed R as the innovative genre in mainstream music during 2012, while Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts said it [...] "offers further evidence of a genre being reborn in 2012." [...] Pitchforks Andrew Ryce hailed Miguel as [...] "the rare vocalist who makes you <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> he's singing about, even when his lyrics can be transparent." [...] Alfred Soto of The Quietus was appreciated Miguel's ability to [...] "articulate how a love man can be louche without being a douche." [...] Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was more critical, finding some of the songs overworked and Miguel [...] "too remote for a true soul singer". New York Times critic Jon Caramanica said Kaleidoscope Dream sounds inconsistent and [...] "a little washed-out, a blend of Prince-isms and slurry grooves", while Kellman complained of the lyrics occasionally veering [...] "too close to 'artsy' teenage erotic poetry".|$|E
500|$|Jim Harrington of The Oakland Tribune {{described}} {{the show as}} a human embodiment of Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] (2002). He presumed [...] that the tour was a conscious transition for fans {{who did not want}} Cyrus to separate herself from the Hannah Montana franchise. Kirsty Cameron of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Despite her relatively young age, Cyrus showed her unfailing capability as performer. With the help of her back-up dancers, Cyrus provided her audience with choreographed set pieces and a different spectacle for each song." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe noted that the Wonder World Tour presented Cyrus as both a [...] "PG-rated tween pop star and an edgy rocker eager". He stated that although she played both roles well, it was apparent that she was more at ease with the latter. Reed also felt the concert did little to display Cyrus' personality and ability to engage with the audience. [...] "We know she's got impressive vocal chops, but now we need to <b>feel</b> <b>what</b> she's trying to put across in her songs, something beyond the standard 'You guys are awesome!' banter." [...] Scott Iwasaki of Deseret News reviewed a concert in which Cyrus was ill. He mentioned that because of her illness, her voice went flat. Iwasaki also expressed his viewpoint that [...] "if there [...] any worries that Miley Cyrus would become another Britney Spears train wreck, those worries were quelled during Tuesday night's show. She kept the show family-friendly and, although obviously sick, looked like she had a good time." [...] Marlin Levison of The Star Tribune believed the concert lacked much profundity until the last performance.|$|E

[...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What we want is opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee.
