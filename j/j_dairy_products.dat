Therefore, {{it is very important}} for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> not to contain gluten in concentrations that could be harmful for them. The aim of this research was to investigate risk exposure to gluten from <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> for the population with celiac disease in the Republic of Croatia by usage of referent analytical methods and scientifically based methods of risk assessment. Total number of 19 subgroups of standard <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (n= 40) and four subgroups of “gluten-free” <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (n= 53) labelled with crossed cereal or quotation “glutenfree” and without quantity of gluten labelled were analysed by ELISA-R 5 method.

40|$|Thai dairy {{industry}} is heavily intervened {{by the government}} and depended on a large proportion of <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> imports. New Zealand and Australia are the most important suppliers to Thailand dairy import market. Both countries together contribute more than 50 percent to Thailand total dairy import market. In 2005, Thailand signed free trade agreements with Australia (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement: TAFTA) and New Zealand (Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership: THNZCEP). Both agreements include tariff liberalisation in <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> which directly affect Thai {{dairy industry}}. It is debatable whether both agreements create or divert resource allocation efficiency for Thailand dairy production. This study assessed the welfare impacts of the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA. The modified gravity model was employed to assess trade creation and trade diversion effects of both agreements in seven <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> categories: non-concentrated milk and cream, concentrated milk and cream, buttermilk and yogurt, whey, butter, cheese and curd and total <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> The modified gravity model for each <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> was estimated by pooling the data from 1991 :Q 1 - 2009 :Q 4 across Thailand top five trading partners using Time Series and Cross Sections (TSCS) estimation. In addition, the study employed the import price model to examine effects of the Thailand tariff reduction for New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> on the prices of New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> and the relative price of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market. The results show that the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA leads to net positive trade creation in most <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> categories which indicates their members’ welfare improvement, except in whey for THNZCEP and concentrated milk and cream for TAFTA. In addition, it is found that the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia has negligible effects on the Thailand import prices of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from both countries while other factors such as exchange rate, competitor price, and drought have significantly larger effects. Furthermore, the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia significantly increases the ratio of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) prices in some <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market. This finding indicates that the <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices of non-FTA members are relatively high in Thailand market after the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA...|$|R

Methods: Data from two non-consecutive food records from 34, 003 individuals (aged ³ 10 years) in the first Brazilian nationally representative dietary survey (2008 - 2009) were used to {{estimate the}} <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> intake. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> were divided into four major subgroups: cow's milk, cheese, yogurt and other <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Absolute and relative frequencies of individuals in the population who reported consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> {{in at least one}} of the two-day food record according to sex, age, geographic region and levels of per capita monthly family income were calculated. Moreover, the mean consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> as well as their nutritional contribution in total energy, protein, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium intake was estimated. Results: It was observed that only 43. 0 % of the population reported consuming <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> being the milk subgroup the most frequently consumed (21. 1 %). The prevalence of consumption was higher among females, elderly, residents of the South region, and among individuals from higher per capita monthly family income. The nutritional contribution of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> was less than 10. 0 % of total energy intake and for most nutrients and the mean daily consumption are justified was 101. 8 g.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the growth and future scale of artisan <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> The purpose {{of this paper is to}} analyze why there has been such a great demand for artisan <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> how they are produced, and the promotion and scale of the specialty <b>dairy</b> industry <b>product</b> production. The review begins with a brief discussion on the different terms used for specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Followed by the introduction is history of the dairy industry and its growth and change over many, many years. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> have been around longer than they have actually been recorded. As the population increased so did the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> In 1850, the production of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in American was larger than any other country. The first major increase in the distribution and consumption of milk happened from approximately 1870 - 1950. With the development of the centrifugal cream separator by Alfred de Laval, and soon after the factory system of production was established. With the big industrial push came the escalated production of commodity products produced in a large scale by machinery. In the past few decades the United States consumers have been pushing away from the commodity dairy processing industry and are interested in the smaller scale specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Many more <b>dairy</b> producers and processors have been converting over to either shipping their milk to processors to make specialty products or use their own milk to produce artisan and farmstead <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Some of the specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> produced are a variety of different cheeses, yogurt, butter, and bottled milk. Specialty cheese is by far produced on the largest scale compared to any other <b>dairy</b> <b>product.</b> Specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> especially specialty and artisan cheese, have increased production substantially in the last few decades. The production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> has grown due to various factors. According to the California Milk Advisory Board, specialty cheese consumption has increased five times faster than the total cheese consumption in the past ten years. In 2003, the CMAB recorded that the United States specialty cheese production totaled 815 million pounds with an estimated value of $ 6. 4 billion. Recently, the specialty cheese category in the dairy industry is a major factor driving the sales of United States cheese production. The specialty dairy industry is growing due to many different areas. Some reasons of the growth of the specialty cheese market are: that Americans are wanting more variety and flavor in their food, Americans are traveling abroad and wanting the unique flavor of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> that they have had in other countries, the growth of ethnic groups and their ethnic food, and the greater availability to a variety of different and unique cheeses. Other areas of growth include specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> used in food services, restaurants, farmer’s markets, supermarkets, and ingredients in prepared foods. Although the specialty dairy industry has been increasingly growing over the years a big question is whether it is profitable to an on-farm processor and specialty processor to produce value- added specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> On-farm processing is very difficult to manage because of both the farm and the processing plan, and the expenses that go along with it. Many considerations and evaluations need to be analyzed before making the commitment of producing specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> There is value in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> but many factors and variables need to be considered because, many risk arise in the production of specialty <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> also...|$|R
