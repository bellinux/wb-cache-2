In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly <b>filtered</b> <b>out</b> over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are <b>filtered</b> <b>out</b> from the output of the device.|$|E

5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is <b>filtered</b> <b>out</b> of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is <b>filtered</b> <b>out,</b> many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually {{at the bottom of}} their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and <b>filtered</b> <b>out.</b> Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E

5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are <b>filtered</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the shortage that the traditional image filtering algorithm can not preserve edges and details of digital images when <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> noises, a valid filtering algorithm for preserving edges and details of images is proposed in this paper. The algorithm first determines the pixel to be processed belongs to these three category that pixel belongs to the image itself, the background or the introducing noise {{of the process of}} image generation or transmission, and then uses different filtering policies to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> noises according to the result of judgment. Because of different templates are used to <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> the pending pixel according to which template the pending pixel belongs to, the filtering algorithm can <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> noises as well as keeps the image’s edges and details effectively. The proposed algorithm is tested against different images, and it gives a better peak signal to noise ratio and a lower normalized mean square error. These results have also been checked and analyzed visually. The experimental results show that the proposed filtering algorithm not only can <b>filter</b> <b>out</b> the noise in image effectively but also protect edges and details of digital image well...|$|R
