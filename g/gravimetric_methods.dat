40|$|Simulation of wear in {{artificial}} joint implants {{is critical}} for evaluating implant designs and materials. Traditional protocols employ the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> to determine the loss of material by measuring {{the weight of the}} implant components before and after various test intervals and after the completed test. However, the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> cannot identify the location, area coverage or maximum depth of the wear and it has difficulties with proportionally small weight changes in relatively heavy implants. In this study, we compare the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> with two geometric surface methods; an optical light method (RedLux) and a coordinate measuring method (CMM). We tested ten Adept hips in a simulator for 2 million cycles (MC). <b>Gravimetric</b> and optical <b>methods</b> were performed at 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00, 1. 33 and 2 MC. CMM measurements were done before and after the test. A high correlation was found between the <b>gravimetric</b> and optical <b>methods</b> for both heads (R 2 = 0. 997) and for cups (R 2 = 0. 96). Both geometric methods (optical and CMM) measured more volume loss than the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> (for the heads, p = 0. 004 (optical) and p = 0. 08 (CMM); for the cups p = 0. 01 (optical) and p = 0. 003 (CMM)). Two cups recorded negative wear at 2 MC by the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> but none did by either the optical method or by CMM. The geometric methods were prone to confounding factors such as surface deformation and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> could be confounded by protein absorption and backside wear. Both of the geometric methods were able to show the location, area covered and depth of the wear on the bearing surfaces, and track their changes during the test run; providing significant advantages to solely using the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to develop rapid methods for quantification of lipid content in microalgae, as an alternative for time consuming <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods.</b> Different studies showed that lipid stainingwith Nile Red in whole cell suspensions and subsequently quantification by the use of a spectrofluorometric device is a promising method, but a profound optimization and validation is rare. It has already been proven that the correlation curve for quantification is species dependent, but it has not yet been investigated whether this is also the case for the optimization of the Nile Red assay protocol. Therefore, two autotrophic, marine microalgae, Nannochloropsis oculata and T-Isochrysis lutea, strongly differing in e. g. cell wall structure, were selected in this study to investigatewhether optimization of the Nile Red assay is species dependent. Besides this, it was checked for one of these species, Nannochloropsis, whether the lipid content, determined by the Nile Red assay, could indeed be correlated with the neutral and/or total lipid content determined by <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods.</b> Itwas found that optimization of the Nile Red assay was strongly species dependent.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the lignin contents of tropical forages by different analytical methods and evaluated their correlations with parameters {{related to the}} degradation of neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The lignin content was evaluated by five methods: cellulose solubilization in sulfuric acid [Lignin (sa) ], oxidation with potassium permanganate [Lignin (pm) ], the Klason lignin method (KL), solubilization in acetyl bromide from acid detergent fiber (ABLadf) and solubilization in acetyl bromide from the cell wall (ABLcw). Samples from ten grasses and ten legumes were used. The lignin content values obtained by <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> were also corrected for protein contamination, and the corrected values were referred to as Lignin (sa) p, Lignin (pm) p and KLp. The indigestible fraction of NDF (iNDF), the discrete lag (LAG) and the fractional rate of degradation (kd) of NDF were estimated using an in vitro assay. Correcting for protein resulted in reductions (P 0. 05) {{with all of the}} NDF degradation parameters. However, the strongest correlation coefficients for all methods evaluated were obtained with Lignin (pm) p and KLp. The lignin content estimated by the ABLcw method did not correlate (P> 0. 05) with any parameters of NDF degradation. There was a correlation (P< 0. 05) between the lignin content estimated by the ABLadf method and iNDF content. Nonetheless, this correlation was weaker than those found with <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods.</b> From these results, we concluded that the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> produce residues that are contaminated by nitrogenous compounds.

30|$|The {{measurements}} {{performed on}} frozen and unfrozen samples demonstrated that no divergence was observed between the MC values {{obtained for the}} frozen and unfrozen material with a 95  % confidence level. Due to the long winters in the Nordic region, it {{is a prerequisite for}} any technique that it can handle frozen material. The <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> was used as reference method in this study. This method is standardized and widely accepted, both at research institutes and in industry around the world. However, there are some questions to be raised concerning this method. Errors might occur due to water that is strongly bound to the cell wall still remains upon drying, or that volatile compounds are evaporated during drying. It has also been shown by Björklund and Fryk [20] that the temperature inside the drying ovens could vary significantly from the set value. It is likely that the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> holds some errors, and {{it is important to keep}} this in mind when interpreting different parameters, such as the SEE, because this includes the error from both the MDS and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method.</b> Because the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> destroys the sample, it is also impossible to make repeatable measurements on the same sample and obtain a fair reference value of the precision for the method itself, similar to what has been reported by the MDS. However, since the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> is a standardized method, commonly accepted and widely used, it is natural to use it as a reference method to a new technique performing the same measurement, so is done in studies by, for example, Duarte Da Paz [7] and Berg et al.

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> {{for measuring}} the mass of droplets generated by a drop-on-demand (DOD) microdispenser. Droplets are deposited, either continuously at a known frequency or as a burst of known number, into a cylinder positioned on a submicrogram balance. Mass measurements are acquired precisely by computer, and results are corrected for evaporation. Capabilities are demonstrated using isobutyl alcohol droplets. For ejection rates greater than 100 Hz, the repeatability of droplet mass measurements was 0. 2 %, while the combined relative standard uncertainty (uc) was 0. 9 %. When bursts of droplets were dispensed, the limit of quantitation was 72 μg (1490 droplets) with uc = 1. 0 %. Individual droplet size in a burst was evaluated by high-speed videography. Diameters were consistent from the tenth droplet onward, and the mass of an individual droplet was best estimated by the average droplet mass with a combined uncertainty of about 1 %. Diameters of the first several droplets were anomalous, but their contribution was accounted for when dispensing bursts. Above the limits of quantitation, the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> provided statistically equivalent results and permit detailed study of operational factors that influence droplet mass during dispensing, including the development of reliable microassays and standard materials using DOD technologies...|$|E
