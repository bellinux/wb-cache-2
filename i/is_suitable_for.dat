5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E
5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε is proportional to TI15, where TI is the core temperature. This <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, and gives the better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E
5|$|Apples {{are often}} eaten raw. The whole fruit {{including}} the skin <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> human consumption {{except for the}} seeds, which may affect some consumers.

5|$|Barium, as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to play the game}} with just two players (one per team) by having each player move on two boards.

This variation <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> play by mail.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone therapy may be {{associated}} with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy.|$|E

5|$|The {{state has}} always been a {{destination}} for mountaineering, hiking, and rock climbing in India. A recent development in adventure tourism in the region has been whitewater rafting in Rishikesh. Due to its proximity to the Himalaya ranges, the place is full of hills and mountains and <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> trekking, climbing, skiing, camping, rock climbing, and paragliding. Roopkund is a trekking site, known for the mysterious skeletons found in a lake, which was featured by National Geographic Channel in a documentary.

5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but tough and <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, {{but they can be}} affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who pass}} the Aptitude Phase will {{undertake}} an intensive period of instruction {{and assessment of}} Special Forces Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), including SF weapons and Standard Operation Procedures. The majority of this period is spent in the jungle, an environment that <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> SF training and ideal to achieve {{the purpose of this}} phase. Much of the training is aimed at discovering an individual's qualities. Continuation training, which consists of SOP and Tactical training in temperate and jungle environments, lasts nine weeks. This is conducted in the UK and Brunei.|$|E
5|$|Triethylborane is a {{substance}} which ignites the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet/ramjet engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. It {{was also used}} to ignite the F-1 Engines on the Saturn V Rocket utilized by NASA's Apollo and Skylab programs from 1967 until 1973. Triethylborane <b>is</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> this because of its pyrophoric properties, especially {{the fact that it}} burns with a very high temperature. Triethylborane is an industrial initiator in radical reactions, where it is effective even at low temperatures.|$|E
