40|$|A {{main focus}} of recent R&D on {{adsorption}} modules for thermally driven heat pumps and chillers has been to enhance the volume specific power output while maintaining a reasonable coefficient of performance (COP). An adsorption module using {{a new type of}} heat exchanger based on aluminum sintered metal fiber structures brazed on flat fluid channels has been developed. The heat exchangers for adsorber/desorber and evaporator/condenser are identically constructed. The adsorption heat exchanger is coated with a silico-alumino phosphate (SAPO- 34) by a partial support transformation direct crystallization (PST) [1]. Both components are placed in a vacuum tight housing using a valve-free configuration. Water is used as adsorptive. The experimental characterization of the module shows a high volume specific power (up to 82 W/litre module for cooling, 320 W/litre for heating). Although no heat is recovered between ad- and desorption cycle, a COP of almost 0. 4 is reached for cooling and 1. 4 for heating.

30|$|Sb 2 S 3 {{exhibits}} a tunable energy bandgap (1.1 – 1.7  eV) when S elements are partly or completely replaced by Se, suggesting good designability of Sb 2 S 3 for photovoltaic device preparation [16 – 18]. To date, various approaches {{have been reported}} to fabricate Sb 2 S 3 absorber layers. Sb 2 S 3 -sensitized inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells exhibit a high solar energy harvesting ability and have demonstrated conversion efficiency of 7.5 % [19]. However, the device fabrication is complicated, and the lifetime of organic hole transporting materials is low. In comparison, planar heterojunction solar cells are advantageous in terms of simplified absorber preparation as well as device fabrication. Both physical vapor-deposited and solution-processed Sb 2 S 3 films have been previously applied in planar heterojunction solar cell fabrication. All-inorganic Sb 2 S 3 planar heterojunction devices with a simple structure of FTO/n-type buffer layer/Sb 2 S 3 /electrode have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.27 – 4.17 % [20 – 24]. Vacuum-based film deposition methods like magnetron sputtering are convenient to operate and provide accurate thickness control, reproducibility, and smooth surface building. Due to these advantages, they have been widely applied in industrial manufacturing of CIGS and CdTe solar cells. Sb 2 S 3 has a low melting point (550  °C) and high vapor pressure, favoring thermal evaporation instead of magnetron sputtering. However, Sb 2 S 3 {{exhibits a}} poor thermostability in vacuum resulting in significant deviations in the composition [25], and the tendency for surface oxidation. Currently, component preserving rapid thermal evaporation (RTP) has been employed in the fabrication of all-inorganic Sb 2 S 3 solar cells having achieved a maximum PCE of 4.17 % [23]. Compared with the rapid thermal evaporation technique, regular thermal evaporation has some advantages in terms of providing accurate thickness and variable morphology control. Also, the substrate rotation is easier to realize and beneficial for uniform preparation of large-area thin film specimen. Since the distance between substrate and source is greater, the required <b>evaporation</b> <b>power</b> is lower than rapid evaporation. This ensures that the source has less thermal effect on the substrate during evaporation process. It consumes less material and has better prospect in flexible solar cell fabrication. However, this approach has some limitations that need to be addressed. To avoid decomposition and surface oxidation, Sb 2 S 3 films can only be prepared at a low substrate temperature (~[*] 200  °C) by regular thermal evaporation. However, the low substrate temperature resulted in poor crystallinity of the films, which was not suitable for the preparation of efficient photovoltaic devices.|$|E

The solvent <b>power,</b> <b>evaporation</b> rate and electrical conductivity of the solvents all had a significant effect on the particle formation process as well as the particle characteristics and drug release profile. Particles were near-spherical and between 2 and 7 μm in diameter with smooth or corrugated surfaces. The drug release rate was mainly dependent on particle size, with larger particles showing slower release. The solvent in which PLGA was poorly soluble resulted in small grainy particles that disintegrated instantaneously with full drug release. It may be concluded that the selection of an appropriate solvent may be a useful way to control particle characteristics and drug release profiles when using electrospraying. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of Japan, water from nuclear power plants is drained into the surrounding sea, raising the water temperature which has an adverse affect on the immediate ecosystem, as well as increasing CO 2 emissions from increased water evaporation from the sea.

30|$|As {{optoelectronic}} devices push towards higher performance, engineering {{the quantum}} confinement at the nanoscale become {{the key for}} device design. However, such a fine tuning of the physical properties faces one major bottleneck, namely the accurate determination of alloy compositions at the nanometer scale. For ternary or quaternary alloys, methods based on {{the analysis of the}} lattice parameters, such as X-ray diffraction, nanobeam electron diffraction [1], or geometrical phase analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images [2], cannot discriminate between strain and composition effects. Chemical analysis techniques such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or atom probe tomography (APT) are better adapted to address this problem. However, their accuracy and spatial resolution need to be assessed in the case of III-nitrides. For instance, APT has been used to study in clustering in InGaN alloys [3 – 7] or AlN interlayers in AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructures [8]. However, getting quantitative composition information of nanometer-size nitride heterostructures from APT remains a challenge that requires careful optimization of the experimental conditions (temperature, laser wavelength and <b>power,</b> <b>evaporation</b> field) which are known to influence the ratio of the detected atomic species [9 – 11]. Combining data obtained by complementary approaches is a way to overcome these difficulties. Very recently, Griffiths et al. have reported the composition analysis of InGaN quantum wells from APT and quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (QSTEM) [12] which is an alternative approach to the TEM-based method first proposed by Rosenauer et al. [13]. Combining two chemical analysis techniques, namely EDX and APT, appears as an interesting alternative, the main problem to get accurate EDX quantitative data being linked to the absorption of the X-ray emission, which depends on the energy of the considered X-ray line, and the mass thickness of the sample.|$|R

In laser welding, the shielding gas is commonly used to stabilize the welding process, to improve the welded joint features and to protect the welded seam from oxidation. The chemicalcomposition of the shielding gas is a key factor in achieving the final qualityof the welded joints. Wide range of shielding gases varying from the pure gasesto complex mixtures based on helium, argon, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are commercially available. These gas mixtures should be considered in terms of their suitability during laser welding of aluminium alloys to produce quality welds. The main objective of the present work is to study the effect of the shielding gascomposition during laser welding of aluminium alloys. Aluminium alloy A 15754 was welded using 3 kW Nd-YAG laser (continuous wave mode). The alloy samples were butt welded with different shielding gases (pure and mixture of gases) so that high quality welds with high joint efficiencies could be produced. It was observed that the chemical composition of the gases influenced the final weld quality and properties.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{modeling}} {{and control of}} {{the last part of the}} paper machine - the drying section. Paper is dried by letting it pass through a series of steam heated cylinders and the <b>evaporation</b> is thus <b>powered</b> by the latent heat of vaporization of the steam. The moisture in the paper is controlled by adjusting the set point of the steam pressure controllers. There exist several commercial incentives to focus on the performance of the moisture control. The time to perform a grade change is often limited by the moisture and shorter grade change time is directly correlated to economic profit. Studies have shown that the drying section uses 2 / 3 of the total energy requirement in paper making. Reduced variations in moisture gives opportunity for target shifts (changed set point) which reduces the amount of raw material and steam requirement. It also creates opportunity for increased production rate. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the control of the steam pressure inside the cylinders. Both a black-box model and a physical model are given for the steam pressure process. A tuning rule for both PI and PID control is derived and various other controller structures are investigated. Many of the results are verified by experiments on paper machines at different paper mills. The second part of the thesis treats the moisture controller. The physical model from the first part is expanded with a model for the paper. This gives a complete simulation model for the drying section that is implemented in the object-oriented modeling language Modelica. Two new approaches to control the moisture by feedback are evaluated. The first utilizes the air around the paper in combination with the drying cylinders to improve the controller performance. The second uses only the last part of the drying section to control the moisture, while the first part is put at an appropriate level.

40|$|The {{environmental}} conditions of autonomous objects of different-purpose technical complexes are in {{close relationship with}} increased values of operating temperatures. This requires thermal pretesting of the process equipment. The publication [1] considers the thermal test conditions in which the equipment elements under test are placed in a heated water tank covered by the globe insulators where, under automatic temperature control using a block of heaters, they are then kept for a specified period of time at a specified temperature range. Such an approach to the thermal tests of equipment allows us to reduce, but not eliminate completely the mass flows of water from <b>evaporation</b> with reducing <b>power</b> consumption of test equipment. Despite the results achieved, {{even a little bit}} of water vapor available when conducting the thermal tests may cause a failure of equipment. Therefore, there is a need in test equipment modernization for complete eliminating the fluxes of mass water and better power consumption in the test process. To this end, it is proposed to place a three-layer bubble wrap on the open surface of water. To justify an efficiency of the proposed option was developed a mathematical model of heat and mass transfer processes that occur during thermal tests, taking into account the geometric and thermo-physical characteristics of test tank, polymer film, and equipment. Using the laws and equations of heat and mass transfer enabled us to determine the required capacities for heating the tank with water and equipment to the required temperature range for a specified time, as well as the mass flows of water when evaporating from the tank surface. The efficiency of the three-layer bubble film as compared with the globe insulators as the elements for covering the test tank the surface has been analysed {{on the basis of the}} results obtained. The proposed film coating allowed almost complete elimination of evaporation losses of water mass and almost 8 times reduction of heat losses through the water surface of the test tank and more than 2 times reduction of power consumption for tests and air-conditioning of the room where these tests were carried out. </p...|$|R

The nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy for surface morphology, dynamic light scattering for size and zeta potential, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for surface chemistry, and high-performance liquid chromatography for in vitro drug release kinetics. To obtain a smaller particle, 0. 2 % polyvinyl alcohol, 0. 03 % D-&alpha;-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), 2 % Poloxamer 188, a five-minute sonication time, 130 W sonication <b>power,</b> <b>evaporation</b> with magnetic stirring, and centrifugation at 8000 rpm were selected.

Results: A five-minute sonication time, 130 W sonication power, and a 10 mg drug loading amount were selected. Under these conditions, the nanoparticles reached over 90 % encapsulation efficiency.

40|$|This thesis explores {{deposition}} of amorphous thin films {{based on the}} two transition metal nitride systems, TiN and HfN. Additions of Si, Al and B have been investigated using three different deposition techniques: dc magnetron sputtering, cathodic arc <b>evaporation,</b> and high <b>power</b> impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS). The effect of elemental composition, bonding structure, growth temperature, and low-energy ion bombardment during growth has been investigated and correlated to the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties of the films. The thermal stability has been investigated by annealing experiments. Deposition by cathodic arc evaporation yields dense and homogeneous coatings with essentially fully electron-diffraction amorphous structures with additions of either Al+Si, B+Si or B+Al+Si to TiN. The B-containing coatings have unusually few macroparticles. Annealing experiments show that Ti-Al-Si-N coatings have an age hardening behavior, which is not as clear for B-containing coatings. Compositional layering, due to rotation of the sample fixture during deposition, is present but not always visible in the as-deposited state. The layering acts as a template for renucleation during annealing. The coatings recrystallize by growth of TiN-rich  domains. Amorphous growth by conventional dc magnetron sputtering is possible {{over a wide range}} of compositions for Ti-B-Si-N thin films. The Ti content in the films is reduced compared to the content in the sputtering target. Without Si, the films consist of a BN onion-like structure surrounding TiN nanograins. With additions of Si the films eventually grows fully amorphous. The growth temperature has only minor effect on the microstructure, due to the limited surface diffusion at the investigated temperature range (100 - 600 °C). Ion assisted growth leads to nanoscale densification of the films and improved mechanical properties. Ti-B-Si-N thin films are also deposited by a hybrid technique where dc magnetron sputtering is combined with HIPIMS. Here, the Ti:B ratio remains equal to the target composition. Films with low Si content are porous with TiN nanograins separated by BN-rich amorphous channels and have low hardness. Increasing Si contents yield fully electron-amorphous films with higher hardness. Finally, Hf-Al-Si-N single-layer and multilayer films are grown by dc magnetron sputtering from a single Hf-Al-Si target. Amorphous growth is achieved when the growth temperature was kept at its minimum. Low-energy substrate bias modulation is used to grow nanocomposite/nanocolumnar multilayers from the single Hf-Al-Si target, where the layers has essentially the same composition but different Si bonding structure, and different degree of crystallinity...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in striving {{for a more}} sustainable society is the selection of technological systems. Given the capital intensity of industrial production plants, power generation systems and infrastructure, investment decisions create path dependencies for decades to come. It {{is difficult to know}} which technological system is preferable when considering the multiple objective of environmental, economic and social sustainability. E. g., a system that is preferred from the environmental point of view is not necessarily the system that is preferred from the economic and/or social point of view. Furthermore, the results of the assessments change over time because of new insights into environmental, economic and social sustainability and because they are prone to changing needs, economic conditions and societal preferences. Because of these uncertainties, it is hard to decide which technological system or systems should be chosen, e. g. to meet national and international targets with regard to climate change. Another way of assessing technological systems is the use of exergy analysis, a thermodynamic assessment method. Exergy analysis makes visible where work potential is lost. This work potential is needed for all the things we would like to do, i. e. nothing happens without the consumption of some work potential. Work potential that is lost, is lost forever. The only way to replenish the amount of work potential available on earth is by capturing new work potential from solar and/or tidal energy. Researchers active in the field of exergy and sustainability claim that the loss of work potential, also known as exergy loss, and sustainability are related. However, the loss of work potential is no part of the regular sustainability assessment methods. The objective of this research is to provide insight into the value of exergy analysis in sustainability assessment of technological systems. A literature research into the relationship between exergy and sustainability resulted in a theoretically founded relationship between exergy losses and the environmental impact of technological systems. A problem with investigating the relationship between exergy and sustainability {{is that there is no}} single measure of sustainability. Combining the results of the environmental, economic and social sustainability assessments into one sustainability indicator leads to a loss of information and necessitates the use of weighting factors. Another difficulty is that a commonly accepted operationalization of the term 'sustainability' does not exist. Accordingly, a list of requirements to methods for sustainability assessment of technological systems has been drawn up. All assessment methods cover the operational phase of installations, equipment and infrastructure including the amounts of inputs and outputs. Not all methods take into account the phases of construction and decommissioning of the installations, equipment and infrastructure and the following components of sustainability: the depletion and/or scarcity of the inputs, the distinction between renewable and non-renewable inputs, the disposal and/or abatement of emissions and waste flows, land use, exergy losses, economic aspects and social aspects. In addition, methods for the calculation of sustainability indicators should be objective and sufficient data should be available to calculate these indicators. The sustainability assessment methods found in the literature appear to be incomplete with respect to the list of requirements. The environmental life cycle assessment methods are not fully objective because they make use of weighting factors and because no consensus exists about all models used for quantifying environmental impact. The economic methods do not include all indirect costs and their indicators change over time because of market developments. The social methods suffer from the limited availability and qualitative or semi-quantitative nature of many data. The exergy analysis methods found in literature do not consider all components of sustainability and/or make use of indicators, equations and weighting factors that are not commonly accepted. It was therefore decided to develop a new exergy analysis method on the basis of fundamental scientific equations. The newly developed exergy analysis method has been named the Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method and takes into account as many of the designated components of sustainability as possible. The TCExL is the summation of the exergy loss caused within the technological system including its supply chains, the exergy loss caused by abatement of the resulting emissions and the exergy loss related to the land occupied by the technological system including its supply chains. The latter is relevant because land use prevents capturing new exergy from sunlight by the ecosystem. Components of the list of requirements that can only indirectly be considered when calculating the exergy loss caused by a technological system are the depletion and scarcity of resources as well as the economic and social aspects of sustainability. The TCExL method is an improvement compared to existing exergy analysis methods in the sense that it is solely based on the calculation of exergy losses and that it takes into account all exergy losses caused by a technological system during its life cycle. However, until now the abatement exergy loss of only a few emissions is included because of the lack of data regarding other emissions. The value of exergy analysis in sustainability assessment of technological systems has been investigated by conducting two case studies that comprise several power generation systems and subsequently comparing the results of the assessment methods with and without exergy of the systems of each case study. Power generation was chosen as the subject of the case studies because of the major role of electricity in our society. The choice of the systems of the case studies is not meant to indicate that these systems are preferable and/or desirable compared to other central or decentral power generation systems, nor that it is not important to look at the transport, distribution, use and/or storage of electricity. The first case study consists of the following systems for coal-fired power generation in combination with LNG evaporation: a power plant of which the waste heat is used for LNG <b>evaporation,</b> an oxyfuel <b>power</b> plant that is combined with air separation and LNG evaporation, and a stand-alone power plant plus the combination of LNG evaporation with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The other case study concerns power generation from fossil and renewable sources and compares the co-firing of coal and wood pellets with a wind farm and with power generation from the combustion of bioethanol that originates from the fermentation of verge grass. The method applied for determining the environmental sustainability is the ISO-certified environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method with ReCiPe endpoint indicators as the result. The present worth ratio (PWR) has been calculated to determine the economic sustainability. A newly developed method based on man-hours and the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reported by the UNDP has been used to assess the social sustainability, because a standard method for social LCA is still under development and because it would be too time-consuming and costly to gather site-specific social data. From the case studies, it is concluded that the sustainability of our society can be improved by applying exergy analysis in the assessment of technological systems, but that in the case of comparing technological systems with different inputs, a technological system that is preferred from an exergetic point of view is not always preferred from the economic and social points of view. If according to the results of the TCExL method a system is preferred that has a lower economic sustainability, it must be realised that economic indicators do not include all indirect costs and change over time. In the case of comparing technological systems with different inputs or with inputs from different locations, the calculation of a social sustainability indicator like the IHDI_overall indicator introduced in this research can have an added value compared to calculating only the TCExL. From a sustainability point of view, it is important to use exergy wisely. The higher the amount of exergy that is available on earth, the better people will be able to meet their needs. Therefore, the TCExL can be used as a fundamental indicator in the operationalization of the definition of sustainable development by the Brundtland commission. It is also concluded that exergy analysis leads to more fundamental insights into which process or part of a system has the largest potential for improvement than the standard sustainability assessment methods. It is recommended that exergy losses be taken into account when striving for a more sustainable society and that the TCExL method be used in decisions between technological systems. Furthermore, it is recommended that a working group be set up to investigate the possibilities for increasing the use of exergy analysis and that the TCExL method be implemented in software tools.
