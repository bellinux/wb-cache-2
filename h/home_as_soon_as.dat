5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E

Gazzarri's nightclub suffered irreparable damage {{and had to}} be torn down. The city of Santa Monica suffered significant damage. Many multifamily apartment buildings in Santa Monica were yellow-tagged and some red-tagged. Especially hard hit was a rough line between Santa Monica Canyon and Saint John's Hospital, a linear corridor that suffered a significant amount of property damage. The City of Santa Monica provided assistance to landlords dealing with repairs so tenants could return <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|In Berlin, Smetona and Yčas {{signed a}} loan {{agreement}} with Germany for 100 million marks. The money was used primarily {{to build and}} supply the army. They further negotiated direct German support {{in the war against}} the Soviets. Article 12 of the Compiègne Armistice required the Germans to protect Lithuania from possible Soviet attacks, but Germany was also interested in maintaining its influence in the region and weakening Russia. At first they tried to organize volunteers from the retreating soldiers of the 10th German Army, commanded by General Erich von Falkenhayn. However, the soldiers were tired and demoralized and wanted to return <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Recruitment continued in Germany, especially in Saxony. The volunteers were paid 30 marks per month plus 5 marks per day and had to sign up for three months. The first Saxon Volunteers, as they became known, arrived to Kaunas at the beginning of January, but quite a few of them were judged unfit for duty and sent back. By the end of January, German volunteers numbered 4,000. They were not very reliable as the German Revolution increased popularity of the Spartacist League and Soviet causes. There were several attempts at a coup against the Lithuanian government. These volunteers were stationed in and around Kaunas: Alytus, Jonava, Kėdainiai, Baisogala.|$|E

500|$|Homer has complex {{relationships}} {{with all three}} of his children, {{and the rest of}} his family. He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies; some episodes, particularly in later seasons, show that the pair have a strange respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, does everything he can to help her. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he on many occasions has also revealed himself to be a very caring and loving father and husband: in [...] "Lisa the Beauty Queen", (season four, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself; in [...] "Rosebud", (season five, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear, despite the show also occasionally implying Homer forgets he has a third child, while the episode [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job (season six, 1995); in [...] "Radio Bart", (season three, 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well; and in [...] "A Milhouse Divided", (season eight, 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony. Homer, however, has a poor relationship with his father Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson, whom he placed in a nursing <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he could. The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.|$|E

2500|$|A snow {{emergency}} {{was declared}} for Washington, D.C., meaning that residents {{would not be}} allowed to park on snow emergency routes after 9:30p.m. local time on January22. Mayor Bowser urged people to remain home during the storm, [...] "nless you absolutely have to be out tomorrow afternoon , residents should get <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible". Across Maryland, 2,700pieces of snow equipment were mobilized and crews planned to distribute 365,000tons of road salt. In Virginia, 500vehicles were deployed to treat roads and 500members of the Virginia National Guard were placed on standby. Schools across the D.C. area were scheduled to end classes early on January22, before the storm's arrival. Stores across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. reported a substantial uptick in sales, with groceries, heaters, shovels, and similar items sold out in numerous locations. West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin mobilized the state's National Guard on January21.|$|E

30|$|IHL {{requires}} that the party responsible for an eviction/legal forced displacement facilitates the voluntary return of the population to the location from where they were displaced, i.e. ‘Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> hostilities {{in the area in}} question have ceased’ [GC IV Art 49 1949]. As this study has shown, through an examination of IHL treaties, and CIHL, an evacuation or legal displacement must be temporary and during the displacement the responsible party must make adequate provision for the welfare of the civilians. Without these conditions being fulfilled, therefore, an illegal act of transfer or forced displacement has taken place.|$|R
60|$|On {{the side}} of the Vendeans, the priests {{everywhere}} exerted themselves to impress upon their flocks the necessity of again joining the army. Cathelineau himself made a tour through the Bocage, and the peasants, persuaded that the defeat was a punishment for having committed some excesses at the capture of Chataigneraie, responded to the call. In nine days after the reverse they were again in force near Fontenay, and in much greater numbers than before; for very many of them had returned to their <b>homes,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Thouars had been captured, and their strength in the first battle was but little greater than that of the Republicans.|$|R
2500|$|After {{completing}} his business, Captain Hawkins prepared {{to return to}} England. Needing water, he sailed to the French colony of Fort Caroline in Florida. Finding them in need, he traded his smallest ship and a quantity of provisions to them for cannon, powder, and shot {{that they no longer}} needed as they were preparing to return to France. The provisions gained from Hawkins enabled the French to survive and prepare to move back <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. As Laudonnière writes: [...] "I may saye that wee receaved as manye courtesies of the Generall, as it was possible to receive of any man living. Wherein doubtlesse hee hath wonne the reputation of a good and charitable man, deserving to be esteemed as much of us all as if hee had saved all our lives." [...] Captain Hawkins returned to England in September 1565; his expedition was considered a total success as his financiers made a 60% profit.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the band's official website Feederweb, Grant explained that [...] "Feeling a Moment", was played back with the intro playing backwards, in which he explained: [...] "This {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album.

The song was written at <b>home,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I had that intro, the vocal “woo who” bitwhat ever you want to call itthat was a really important hook for the song." [...] In a DVD packaged with limited quantities of the album, Grant is seen playing a piano during the recording sessions, and once said that [...] " [...] don't [...] rate himself as a piano player". He also stated that Feeder are a band, and even though he writes all the songs, he makes sure drummer Mark Richardson and bass player Taka Hirose have their say in the process of their creation.|$|E
2500|$|Homer's mother, Mona Simpson, {{was married}} to Grampa for several years. According to [...] "Let's Go Fly a Coot", they met in the 1950s and hooked up on the day Grampa {{allegedly}} broke the sound barrier. She became entranced with the hippie lifestyle after seeing Joe Namath's hair on television. She became a fugitive from justice after she abetted in the sabotage of a biological weapons research lab owned by Mr. Burns to deliberately poison everyone in Springfield. To explain this to his then-six-year-old son, Grampa said that Mona died while Homer was at the movies. Grampa has a poor relationship with his son, who placed him in a nursing <b>home</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he could, despite Grampa selling his house {{in order to provide}} Homer with a mortgage. It is recurringly suggested that, while caring, Grampa was a strict disciplinarian who could be very controlling, neglectful, and even emotionally abusive towards Homer {{when he was growing up}} and he still had not forgiven him for that. Saying that, after Mona left Homer at a young age, Grampa bought up Homer by himself without hesitation.|$|E

50|$|In 1898, the French {{scientist}} Paul-Louis Simond (who {{had also}} come to China to battle the Third Pandemic) established the rat-flea vector that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill {{did not have to}} be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In Yunnan, China, inhabitants would flee from their <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> they saw dead rats, and on the island of Formosa (Taiwan), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of plague, after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.|$|R

50|$|Members of the Pakistani {{community}} {{believe in}} the symbolic importance of owning homes; accordingly, Pakistani Americans tend to save money and make other monetary sacrifices earlier on in order to purchase their own <b>homes</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> possible. Members {{of the family and}} sometimes the closer community tend to take care of each other, and to assist in times of economic need. Hence, it would be more common to turn to a community member for economic assistance rather than to a government agency. This leads to relatively low use of welfare and public assistance by Pakistani-Americans. According to the 2000 census, the mean household income in the United States in 2002 was $57,852 annually, whereas for Asian households, which includes Pakistanis this was $70,047. A separate study conducted by the American Community Survey in 2005, showed the mean and median incomes for Pakistani male full-time workers were US$59,310 and US$42,718 - respectively compared to the average male American full-time workers' mean and median incomes of US$56,724 and US$41,965 - respectively.|$|R
