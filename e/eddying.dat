For initial flow speeds which are not significantly above the critical speed, the transition appears as an undulating wave. As the initial flow speed increases further, the transition becomes more abrupt, until at high enough speeds, the transition front will break and curl back upon itself.

The parameter allows the spatial and temporal variability in <b>eddy</b> activity to be defined, providing the first systematic census of anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> in the region. <b>Eddies</b> are generated principally on the eastern side of the basin and propagate either westward (Haida <b>eddies)</b> or along the western GOA shelf break (Alaskan Stream <b>eddies).</b> Seasonal maps of <b>eddy</b> density show fewest <b>eddies</b> in winter, maximum in spring/summer.

40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} the {{dynamical}} role of mesoscale <b>eddies</b> on fish larvae migration using {{the example of}} Subtropical Counter Current <b>eddies</b> and the migration of Japanese eel larvae in the western North Pacific Ocean. An idealized experiment is conducted to isolate the effects of <b>eddies,</b> and use a three-dimensional particle-tracking method to simulate virtual eel larvae (v-larvae) migration, including both horizontal and vertical swimming behaviors. The impact of <b>eddies</b> strongly depends on the swimming speed of v-larvae relative to the <b>eddy</b> speed. <b>Eddies</b> accelerate the movement of v-larvae that swim slower than the propagation speed of the <b>eddy,</b> whereas faster-swimming v-larvae are dragged by <b>eddies.</b> A modified stream function that incorporates biological swimming ability explains the non-uniform trapping of v-larvae in mesoscale <b>eddies.</b> A high swimming speed and/or a small <b>eddy</b> rotation speed results in a weak trapping capacity. Simulations of v-larvae migration in realistic cases of <b>eddy</b> fields indicate that the abundance of <b>eddies</b> significantly affects the duration of larval migration, with the effects being largely dependent on the larvae swimming speed.

The model solution is validated with observational data in terms of both seasonal and intra-seasonal scales. The statistical characteristics of <b>eddies</b> at the sea surface, such as <b>eddy</b> number, lifetime and radius, from the model are comparable with those derived from the satellite altimetry data. The vertical profiles of the physical features of <b>eddies</b> are exposed from the statistical analysis of the three-dimensional <b>eddy</b> data set. For examples, more cyclonic <b>eddies</b> (CEs) are generated than anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> (AEs) in the depth above about 350 m and an opposite trend is presented below 350 m. The lifetimes of CEs and AEs are statistically equal and no significant variation at different vertical levels. <b>Eddies</b> in the central SCS have the largest size than in other areas and their sizes decrease with the increase in water depth. The relative vorticity amplitude of <b>eddies</b> decreases with the increase in the depth. There are three different types of eddies: bowl-shaped with the largest size at the surface, lens-shaped with the largest size in the middle and cone-shaped with the largest size at the bottom. Most of <b>eddies</b> are bowl-shaped <b>eddies.</b> The three types of <b>eddies</b> have different effects on the temperature and salinity profiles. <b>Eddy</b> genesis mechanisms are discussed and categorized into three types in the SCS: surface wind curl input, current interaction with the bottom topography and Kuroshio intrusion.

40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the {{subtropical}} South Indian Ocean is the existence of anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> that have higher chlorophyll concentrations than cyclonic <b>eddies.</b> Off Western Australia, this anomalous behavior {{is related to the}} seeding of anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> with shelf water enriched in phytoplankton biomass and nutrients. Further off-shore, two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the eddy/chlorophyll relationship: (i) <b>eddies</b> originating from the Australian coast maintain their chlorophyll anomaly while propagating westward; and (ii) eddy-induced Ekman upwelling (downwelling) enhances (dampens) nutrient supply in anticyclonic (cyclonic) <b>eddies.</b> Here we describe the relationship between <b>eddies</b> and surface chlorophyll within the South Indian Ocean, and discuss possible mechanisms to explain the anomalous behavior in light of new analyses performed using satellite chlorophyll data. We show that anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> exhibit higher surface chlorophyll concentration than cyclonic <b>eddies</b> across the entire South Indian Ocean basin (from 20 to 28 °S), particularly in winter. Using Self Organizing Maps we analyze the chlorophyll patterns within anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> and cyclonic <b>eddies</b> and highlight their complexity. Our analysis suggests that multiple mechanisms may underlie the observed eddy/chlorophyll relationship. Based on Argo float data, we postulate the relationship may be partly related to seasonal adjustment of the mixed layer depth within <b>eddies.</b> Deeper mixing in anticyclonic <b>eddies</b> is expected to enhance nutrient supply to the mixed layer, while shallower mixing in cyclonic <b>eddies</b> is expected to reduce it.
