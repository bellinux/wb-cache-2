40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of high levels of unofficial <b>euroisation</b> in countries preparing for EU membership (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey). The challenges stemming from unofficial <b>euroisation</b> are particularly relevant for central banks as high degrees of <b>euroisation</b> reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy and create risks to financial stability. Unofficial <b>euroisation</b> in these countries is fuelled by legacies of inflation and macroeconomic imbalances, close economic and financial linkages with the euro area, {{as well as the}} perspective of EU membership. While <b>euroisation</b> (or, more generally, dollarisation) is typically a sticky phenomenon that is difficult to reverse, entrenched {{as it is in the}} behaviour and mind-set of economic agents, the paper finds - based also on the experience of countries outside the region - that there is a set of policies under the competence of domestic authorities which are conducive to strengthening the use of domestic currencies, even though efforts to bring down dollarisation or <b>euroisation</b> rates typically take a long time to show results. In this context, macroeconomic stabilisation is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It needs to be flanked by targeted prudential and regulatory measures, as well as efforts to develop local currency capital markets. Authorities in EU candidate and potential candidate countries have already engaged in such endeavours and <b>euroisation</b> rates have gone down to some extent in recent years, though at different levels and at an uneven pace. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed, while acknowledging that some specific factors like the strong presence of euro area headquartered banks in these countries as well as their EU accession perspective are conducive to <b>euroisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The term <b>euroisation</b> or {{dollarization}} involves {{several different}} monetary {{systems that are}} very different from one another, but have a common feature of having a foreign currency widespread as a means of payment in the formal or informal transactions. Therefore, Serbia has the highest index of unofficial <b>euroisation</b> in the region of South Eastern Europe. The aforementioned index demonstrates clearly the high level of informal <b>euroisation</b> in Serbia in the balance sheets of commercial banks. The share of dinar (RSD) corporate loans in Serbia is modest, having 77 % of the total loans to corporations in Serbia being either euro-indexed or credited directly in euros.

40|$|Several {{countries}} in eastern Europe may accede to the European Union {{in about two}} years time, making them candidates to join Europe’s single currency from 2006. Some well-known economists have advocated that {{countries in}} eastern Europe adopt the euro now either unilaterally or by prior arrangement with the EU. Such official currency substitution is typically termed “dollarisation ” or “euroisation”, and is the most extreme form of a hard peg currency regime. This paper brings together perspectives from a conference “Dollarisation and Euroisation: Viable Policy Options? ” held at the LSE in May 2002. We discuss {{a number of issues}} associated with dollarisation or <b>euroisation,</b> including: the credibility of the monetary regime, the implications for domestic inflation, the importance of other macroeconomic policies, the reversibility of hard peg currency regimes, the outlook of the reserve currency issuer, and the broader context in which dollarisation or <b>euroisation</b> is pursued.

40|$|<b>Euroisation</b> in Serbia {{is rooted}} in {{a long history of}} {{macroeconomic}} instability. Extreme inflation volatility has undermined trust in the dinar and discouraged dinar savings. At the same time, an abundant supply of foreign capital inflows has provided easy access to foreign currency lending at low interest rates in an environment of perceived exchange rate stability – a perception reinforced by the choice of exchange rate regime. As a result, both the asset and the liability side of banks’ balance sheets, and even those of the non-bank sector, is heavily foreign currency-denominated. This paper documents the forces that promote <b>euroisation</b> in Serbia. The paper argues that, {{in the wake of the}} global crisis, a window of opportunity has emerged that could foster a process of de-euroisation. The lack of foreign funding and recent exchange rate volatility has tilted borrower incentives towards local currency borrowing. If disinflationary macroeconomic policies gain credibility, with the possible support of regulatory options, <b>euroisation</b> could drop sharply. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates recent {{monetary}} policy in Croatia and assesses {{some of the}} results achieved. The Croatian monetary authorities have been remarkably successful in achieving and maintaining low inflation, having outperformed most other transition economies. Hence on this basis the conduct of {{monetary policy}} in Croatia should be assessed as successful. However, the relatively low confidence in the domestic currency suggests that this 'success' should be interpreted with caution. Although monetary policy in most transition economies has begun to converge on that practised in developed market economies, there are some distinctive features in transition economies which may make the conduct of monetary policy quite different. Unofficial <b>euroisation</b> stands out {{as the most important}} candidate. Croatia is the most euroised economy in Central and Eastern Europe. This unique feature complicates the conduct of monetary policy and leads to the monetary authorities / / targeting the exchange rate. It is in this context that an investigation of the consequences of <b>euroisation</b> for monetary policy is undertaken in this thesis. This investigation suggests that <b>euroisation</b> constrains the conduct of monetary policy and the degrees of freedom for autonomous monetary policy are low. This is due to the identified currency mismatches in the economy which imply that there are high risks in letting the exchange rate float, even threatening the possibility of a fully fledged financial crisis. It is also argued that a stable demand for domestic money function is not to be expected and an empirical investigation of both the demand for narrow and broad money in Croatia largely supports. this hypothesis. Another important consequence of <b>euroisation</b> is the absence of strong channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. An empirical investigation of the exchange rate, interest rate and credit channel in Croatia suggests that they are very weak or nonexistent, confirming that the effects of monetary policy in the euroised environment may be different from what is usually expected. This thesis has identified some of the risks that the monetary authorities in the euroised environment are faced with. Given these risks and the finding that the impact of monetary policy in Croatia is weak, the official introduction of the euro seems a prudent step forward. The arguments developed in this thesis not only apply to the Croatian case, but should be taken as relevant to any economy {{with a high degree of}} <b>euroisation.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Albania like other developing countries is lack of a currency with which people can buy abroad and which can be used in short-run and long-run credit contracts. On the other hand, the exchange rate represents an important risk, especially for the business which realizes transactions in foreign currency.

Through the factor analysis identifying the pro and cons of the <b>euroisation</b> phenomenon, we will give the potential alternative in our county economy conditions.

40|$|Seigniorage {{has often}} been {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} most important and most readily quantifiable arguments for a government not to give up its monopoly in base money. The analysis shows that the measurement of seigniorage may lead to very different results and that it eventually depends on the monetary environment, in which central banks issue and manage base money. For less advanced countries in Central and Eastern Europe seigniorage has only been fiscally significant in high inflationary economies and even then the success in exploiting seigniorage has been limited. Widespread currency substitution has contributed to the results. Governments in these countries which are willing to stabilise prices but which lack crediblity to do so, may be increasingly interested in <b>euroisation.</b> More advanced EU accession countries have received low revenues from having a national currency over the recent years. Seigniorage has arisen as a by-product of other central bank’s objectives such as price and exchange rate stability. This caused high sterilisation costs and valuation gains of the central banks asset portfolio have often been the main reason for positive results of seigniorage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on the dynamics of dollarisation and <b>euroisation</b> for 25 transition countries. Estimates {{of the amount of}} foreign currency in circulation (FCC) in transition countries are used to develop a new comprehensive dollarisation index (CDI) and separate indices of currency substitution (CSI) and asset substitution. When the CDI is compared to the traditional dollarisation index that relies solely on foreign currency deposits as a proxy for the extent of dollarisation, I find that the comprehensive dollarisation measure provides a more complete picture of the extent of de facto dollarisation and <b>euroisation,</b> and that it better reflects the separate influences of currency substitution and asset substitution. I find that the dynamic evolution of currency substitution and asset substitution in transition countries is both more variable and complex than is usually believed to be the case. These new dollarisation indicators enable researchers to examine the causes of the dollarisation process and its tendency to lead to irreversibility (hysteresis). Moreover, the currency substitution and asset substitution indices shed light on the dynamic consequences of these processes for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Finally, the new estimates of FCC make possible the measurement of effective currency/deposit ratios {{that can be used to}} develop new estimates of the size and growth of underground economies in transition countries.

Furthermore, we take differences in long-term interest rates between hard currencies and the Albanian Lek as tentative evidence that inflation expectations have not yet stabilised at a low level, despite the fact that inflation has been low and stable in recent years.

40|$|The {{financial}} system of Serbia is highly bank-centric and euroised, {{which is a}} common specific feature of {{financial system}}s in developing countries. High level of <b>euroisation</b> represents an adequate environment {{for the development of}} emphasized interaction of foreign exchange and credit risks; therefore, creation of the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk is immanent for euroised systems. Although maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate is a secondary goal of the National Bank of Serbia in relation to price and financial stability as the primary goals, in terms of existence of the aforesaid spillover mechanism, maintaining stability of the dinar exchange rate represents the area where there is an interaction between the goals of monetary policy (price stability) and those of financial stability policy (maintaining and strengthening the financial system’s stability). In order to explore whether the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk exists in Serbia’s financial system, the vector autoregressive (VAR) model is applied on data from the Serbian banking sector to quantify the impact of changes in the dinar exchange rates on the rate of non-performing loans (NPLs); the sample was formed in the period of increased instability of the dinar exchange rate, from 31 January 2008 to 31 December 2010. As we have quantitatively confirmed the impact of increase in the dinar exchange rate on the increase of 90 - 120 days past due NPLs, we can conclude that the existence of expressed interaction between foreign exchange risk and credit risk in the Serbian financial system represents a paradigm of the regulator’s need to achieve contemporary goals of monetary and financial stability policy by maintaining relative stability of the dinar exchange rates. Depreciation of the local currency has inflationary pressure on price stability and simultaneously influences the achievement of financial stability goals through the spillover mechanism of foreign exchange risk to credit risk. In addition to taking systematic measures to reduce the level of <b>euroisation</b> and introduce the specific regulatory requirements, in order to protect banks and clients from the dinar exchange rate volatility, the regulator faces extremely important task of maintaining relative stability of the dinar exchange rate as the instrument to simultaneous achievement of goals of monetary and financial stability policies...|$|E
