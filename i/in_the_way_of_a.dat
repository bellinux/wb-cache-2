5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia. At that time, {{the only}} major power {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German-dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth. After having several peace offers rejected by the British, Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF {{in order to gain}} air superiority or air supremacy as a prelude to launching Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) onto the British mainland.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had letters on them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E

5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit serious, incident. A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E
5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown forestry road. From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new road.|$|E

25|$|Historically, work on radio-loud {{unification}} has {{concentrated on}} high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies {{in a manner}} directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus, while quasars do not, although {{care must be taken}} since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources' large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and we see a blazar of some variety.|$|E
25|$|After {{sitting out}} the next Pride to recuperate, Sakuraba found himself across the ring from Quinton Jackson, a former collegiate wrestler who had {{compiled}} a record of 10–1 on the American circuit. At {{the sound of the}} bell, Sakuraba immediately took the bigger man to the canvas with a low single-leg takedown. However, Jackson's superior size and enormous physical strength allowed him to muscle out of Sakuraba's submission attempts. After locking his legs around Jackson for a triangle choke, Sakuraba found himself hefted into the air and repeatedly slammed to the canvas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerbomb. Later, he attempted an armbar against Jackson, only for the Tennessee native to again lift him up and this time attempt to drop him from the ring. His expression unchanging through the course of Jackson's assault, Sakuraba continued to flow from one lock to another. Eventually, he took the back of an exhausted Jackson and submitted him with his first rear naked choke victory. The contest was a launchpad for Jackson's career, leading to a long-term contract with Pride where he eventually became regarded as a top middleweight competitor, and later, a UFC champion.|$|E

25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E
