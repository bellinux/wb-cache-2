He testified that the Claimant <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> many small details of their months together, including clothing worn {{and the name of}} a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E

She only got two responses, {{one of which was}} for Ohio State, where the athletic director <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> her from Indiana. To prepare herself, she attended a coaching clinic taught by Knight. When she had attended his practices, she had stayed out of sight, but enrolled in a class, she followed her parents advice and sat up front. One of the coaches asked if she was lost. Knight embarrassed her with one of his questions, but she didn't stop attending, although she moved back a few rows. She was hired as an assistant coach to the varsity and the head coach of the JV.|$|E

He becomes intrigue {{to find out why}} she has become a total opposite of how he <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> her to be. Stalking her after work he finds out from a drunk shouting Kai Qi how much that work promotion meant to her as the salary increase would have made her able to provide for her mother. While taking her home he discovers that they are also next door neighbors and mistakes her nephew to be her son when her nephew accidentally calls her mom. Curious of Kai Qi's current life he becomes extra kind and nice to her at work to get closer to her, even though she keeps pushing him away. Le Xuan notices Ah Jie over helping Kai Qi, so she forces them to participate in a cooking competition and win a title or else both will be fired, hesitant to compete but with their jobs on the line he breaks one of his promises to his brother for Kai Qi's sake. He uses this opportunity to let Kai Qi mentor him in cooking, even though he is more skilled than her, as an excuse to become closer to her.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|Camille Mitchell had {{audition}}ed {{for the role}} of Byron's mother in season two's [...] "Nocturne"; Greg Beeman <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> the audition and had the actress come in to read {{for the role of}} Sheriff Adams. Mitchell did some research for the role, talking with female law enforcement officers to gain an understanding of how they evaluate situations. Mitchell views her character as a [...] "down-to-earth sheriff" [...] that carries with her a [...] "farmer's common sense". The actress believes a character like Nancy Adams lends to the realism the show tries to portray within its comic book environment. Gough describes Sheriff Adams as [...] "a cross between Holly Hunter and the sheriff in Fargo".|$|E
500|$|When Dickens {{was young}} he lived near a tradesman's {{premises}} with the sign [...] "Goodge and Marney", {{which may have}} provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner. For the chained Marley, Dickens <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by—seeing fettered prisoners. For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written. The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{worked with}} an accent coach to {{effectively}} mimic Blair's speech style, although he and Morrissey avoided doing simple impersonations {{of the men}} they played. Sheen cited Will Smith's title performance of Ali {{as a basis for}} his part; despite playing a real-life figure, he treated the role as if it were any other character. Sheen had made his film debut in Frears' Mary Reilly (1996), and although he was unsure whether his minor role had [...] "burned into [...] brain", Frears confirmed that Sheen <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> from that. Frears' casting director approached Sheen in the audience of a play, inviting him to appear in [...] "a love story about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown". An informal meeting was scheduled between Frears and Sheen, {{at the end of which}} Sheen was cast as Blair.|$|E

Fassbender had auditioned for an earlier Matthew Vaughn project, {{and the director}} <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> him and sent Fassbender the X-Men script. Though Fassbender knew little of the superhero team, he {{became interested in the}} part after reading the script and familiarizing himself with Magneto in the comic books. Fassbender, who considered Lehnsherr as a Machiavellian character who is neither good nor evil, watched Sir Ian McKellen's performances to get the flavor of Magneto, but ultimately chose to [...] "paint a new canvas" [...] with the character, [...] "just going my own way and working with whatever is in the comic books and the script."

500|$|The {{historian}} of food Bee Wilson, rereading [...] "this endearing work" [...] 58 years on for The Guardian, wrote that she <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> it as a history book and an epic account of English cooking, [...] "interspersed with recipes." [...] She was therefore [...] "startled" [...] {{to find that}} almost {{the whole of the}} text is [...] "taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative." [...] Wilson finds the book as Hartley explicitly intended, an untidy kitchen, [...] "a warm friendly place". For Hartley, writes Wilson, [...] "the past is not a foreign country", but ever-present. She notes that Hartley [...] "announces dogmatically" [...] that English cooking is old-fashioned [...] "because we like it that way." [...] Wilson finds [...] "Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as stargazey pie and posset ... mildly crazed." [...] But whether mad or not, Hartley [...] "approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} hired at Mirage, the {{producer}} had spent years {{looking for a}} suitable screenwriter – someone who was [...] "equally strong {{in the areas of}} satire and romance" [...] and could think in Austen's language [...] "almost as naturally as he or she could think {{in the language of the}} twentieth century." [...] Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a series of comedic skits, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was [...] "exactly what [...] been searching for." [...] Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film Dead Again. A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt Sense and Sensibility, although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt Persuasion or Emma before agreeing to Doran's proposal. The actress found that Sense and Sensibility contained more action than she <b>had</b> <b>remembered,</b> and decided it would translate well to drama.|$|E

500|$|... 1,000 actors {{replied to}} the {{callouts}} for each role, but only 75 {{were called in}} to read for the casting director. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and their production partner Kevin S. Bright. At the end of March, the potential actors {{had been reduced to}} three or four for each part; they read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. David Schwimmer was first to be cast. He was in Chicago doing a stage adaptation of The Master and Margarita when his agent offered him the audition. He was not interested in doing television after a bad experience appearing in Monty, but changed his mind when he learned that it was an ensemble script. Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him. Eric McCormack also auditioned for the role several times. He later became famous for his lead role in the sitcom Will & Grace.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{caused a}} {{stoppage}} {{after his first}} ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on the soggy ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. Bill Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around [...] Lindsay Hassett took the catch just behind square leg, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as Denis Compton came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to run him out. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> how Compton had been out in exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as [...] "one of the catches of the season". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton [...] "had never been in the slightest difficulty". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.|$|E

On September 10, 1996, Gonzalez announced that he <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> the details of giving the information to Boyle, Assistant Deputy Minister Robert Fowler and Dr. Ken Calder - although there were questions about his credibility. Boyle was criticised for failing {{to take responsibility for}} any of his alleged actions, and instead [...] "began to heap blame on his subordinates", angering other military leaders.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{told that}} when Joseph was young, {{he used to}} study Torah with Jacob. When Joseph's {{brothers}} told Jacob in [...] that Joseph was still alive, Jacob did not believe them, but he recalled the subject that Jacob and Joseph had been studying when they last studied together: the passage on the beheaded heifer ( [...] , egla arufa) in [...] Jacob told the brothers that if Joseph gave them a sign of which subject Joseph and Jacob had last studied together, then Jacob would believe them. Joseph too <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> what subject they had been studying, so (as [...] reports) he sent Jacob wagons ( [...] , agalot) so that Jacob might know that the gift came from him. The Midrash thus concluded that wherever Joseph went he studied the Torah, just as his forebears did, even though the Torah {{had not yet been}} given.|$|E

[...] He <b>had</b> <b>remembered</b> the phrase and later copied it down as Mottley Cru. After modifying the spelling slightly, [...] "Mötley Crüe" [...] was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of metal umlauts supposedly inspired by the German beer Löwenbräu, which the members were drinking at the time. Other than the periods of February 1992 to 1997 and 1999 to September 2004, the line-up of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars has remained the same.|$|E
