40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the literature on identitybased signature (IBS) schemes, from Shamir’s seminal scheme to the current state-of-the-art. Rather than presenting all schemes separately, we present three generic transformations that together cover the majority of known IBS schemes as special cases. The first transformation follows a certification approach based on standard signatures; the second is a transformation in the random oracle model from “convertible” identification schemes; and the third is based on hierarchical identitybased encryption. We also discuss a number of direct schemes that escape being covered by any of the generic transformations. Finally, we show how the principles of the first transformation can be extended to a hierarchical setting and to IBS schemes with special properties. Keywords.

40|$|Numerous {{services}} are being offered over the Internet and require identification of users as in face-to-face interactions. To simplify the authentication procedure {{and reduce the}} need to manage multiple credentials to access services, <b>Electronic</b> <b>Identification</b> (eID) <b>schemes</b> have been introduced. eID schemes commonly involve many service providers (SPs) which provide services, such as online shopping, social networks, etc. to users and identity providers (IDPs) which verify the identity of users and facilitate the users to authenticate him/herself to SPs. In federated eID schemes, IDPs store identifiable user information (attributes), often with a unique ID, and attest on these attributes to SPs. In this work we address the privacy concerns of storing user attributes at the IDP which allows the IDP to profile the behaviour and activities of users. We propose to store the attributes in a privacy friendly manner so that they cannot be directly linked to a particular user even if the data is leaked. Then we include an additional step incorporating private information retrieval (PIR) in the usual authentication flow of federated eID scheme so that the IDP can perform its role of authenticating and managing the user’s identity without turning into a privacy hotspot. The privacy enhancement offered by our work needs {{to be accompanied by}} privacy-friendly authentication, which does not reveal the identity of the user, to be effective. Finally, through a proof-of-concept implementation we show a practical variant of our scheme in which the IDP, with millions of users, partitions its database.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an implementation {{study on the}} handling of <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> in three public authorities in Sweden. <b>Electronic</b> <b>identification</b> is a complex but very topical policy domain, largely tied to the general policy aspirations of e-government development.

The result highlights that the policy process of <b>electronic</b> <b>identification</b> in the three studied authorities could not be adequately explained from a traditional policy-implementation dichotomy.

This paper focuses on testing a commonly used long-run structural parameter <b>identification</b> <b>scheme</b> claiming to identify fundamental and non-fundamental shocks to stock prices. Five related widely used structural models on assessing stock price determinants are considered. All models are either specified in vector error correction (VEC) or in vector autoregressive (VAR) form. A Markov switching in heteroskedasticity model {{is used to}} test the identifying restrictions. It is found that for two of the models considered, the long-run <b>identification</b> <b>scheme</b> appropriately classifies shocks as being either fundamental or non-fundamental. A small empirical exercise finds that the models with properly identified structural shocks deliver realistic conclusions, similar as in some of the literature. On the other hand, models with <b>identification</b> <b>schemes</b> not supported by the data yield dubious conclusions on the importance of fundamentals for real stock prices. This is because their structural shocks are not properly identified, making any shock labelling ambiguous. Hence, {{in order to ensure that}} economic shocks of interest are properly captured, it is important to test the structural <b>identification</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R
