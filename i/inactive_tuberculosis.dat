50|$|The {{bacterium}} {{that causes}} TB is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. <b>Inactive</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> means {{that one can}} even unconsciously and unknowingly acquire the bacteria for tuberculosis within them but not even know about {{it because it is}} inactive. Whereas, active tuberculosis is the start of the bacteria developing, and the signs and symptoms begin to be visible. This is when tuberculosis is active within you, and is a serious issue leading to even more serious results. Although the TB bacteria can infect any organ (e.g., kidney, lymph nodes, bones, joints) in the body, the disease commonly occurs in the lungs. 3. Around 80% of all TB cases are related to pulmonary or lung.|$|E

Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus of bronchoalveolar lavage flu-ids (cell-free supernatants) of patients with active (n= 13) and <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (n= 8), and normal individuals (n= 6), were studied. The 2 and 4 h bactericidal activities were higher than the 0 h activity in lavage fluids of healthy subjects and patients with <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> Active tuberculous lavage fluids were equally competent in their bactericidal activity against S. aureus at 0 and 2 h, but a reduced S. aureus killing was seen at 4 h of incuba-tion.

This reduced killing of S. aureus showed a rela-tionship with the cellular components (lymphocytes and macrophages) of active tuberculous lavage fluids. A reduced killing was associated with no lymphocytic alveolitis, and an increased killing with lymphocytic alveolitis. This study suggests that alveolar lining material of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis has less bactericidal activity against bacterial infections, such as S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{balance between}} the {{bacillus}} and host defense mechanisms seems to be important for manifestations of tuberculosis infection. Not only subtypes of T-lymphocytes but their activation status also {{is important in the}} immunity of tuberculosis infection. The aim {{of this study is to}} address the relationship between T-lymphocyte subtypes, activation and natural killer cells with different clinical forms of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Material and Method: Twenty-one active pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> 10 <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> 10 tuberculous pleurisy patients and 18 healthy subjects were involved in the study. Immunophenotyping was carried out in peripheral blood for T cell subtypes, natural killer cells and B cells by flow-cytometry, and HLA-DR and CD 25 positivity were studied to determine T-lymphocyte activation. Results: The CD 4 + T lymphocyte rates was found significantly lower in bilateral active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to healthy controls. T-lymphocyte activation was found to be increased in tuberculous pleurisy cases. The CD 3 /CD 25 + T lymphocyte rate was sinificantly higher in tuberculous pleurisy cases compared both to healthy controls and <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> cases. Conclusion: CD 4 + T-lymphocyte rate may be decreased in pulmonary tuberculosis patients with bilateral pulmonary infiltration. Prominent T-lymphocyte activation in tuberculous pleurisy might be a result of a hypersensitivity reaction against the bacillus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the value of Ca 125, a tumour marker, in evaluation of pulmonary tuber culosis activity. This study included 96 subjects who were divided into three groups. Group I consisted of 40 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Group 2 included 20 patients with <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> There were 36 healthy subjects in group 3. While measurement of serum Ca 125 level was performed only once in groups 2 and 3, Ca 125 levels were measured five times in group 1. The measurements were performed before the treatment, at the second, fourth and sixth months and the third year following the end of the treatment. Mean±SD serum Ca 125 concentrations were 109 · 7 ± 86 · 9 U ml− 1 in group 1, 14 · 5 ± 7 · 8 U ml− 1 in group 2 and 10 · 5 ± 7 · 3 U ml− 1 in group 3. Serum Ca 125 levels were significantly higher in group 1 than in the other groups (P 0 · 05). Ca 125 levels in group 1 showed a significant decrease after treatment (P< 0 · 0001). For estimation of the activity of tuberculosis, the sensitivity and specificity of Ca 125 were found 97 · 5 % and 100 %, respectively, at a 31 U ml− 1 cut-off point.

Screening of a "target group" of the population, 519 former miners, {{greater than or}} equal to 50 years of age, resulted in the discovery of abnormal chest X-rays in 182; (103 with silicosis, 36 with silicotuberculosis, 12 with <b>inactive</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> and 31 with other abnormalities). Eighty-five of these persons had positive tuberculin skin tests. Preventive therapy was recommended for 50, and 36 completed the prescribed course of treatment.

30|$|CT is more {{sensitive}} than chest radiography in the detection and characterization of both subtle localized or disseminated parenchymal disease (McGuinness et al. 1992; Kim et al. 1997). The most common CT findings of active pulmonary TB are centrilobular small nodules, branching linear and nodular opacities (tree-in-bud sign), patchy or lobular areas of consolidation, and cavitation (Lee et al. 1993). Lesions including areas of irregular lines, calcified nodules along with distortion of bronchovascular bundles, bronchiectasis, pericicatricial emphysema, {{or a combination of}} the above were presumed to be inactive (Lee & Im 1995). Lee et al.

These findings can be explained based on the patients’ the clinical history, namely, a chronic course of the disease. All of the patients had been treated with antituberculosis drugs for 6 months or more before enrollment in our study.

We assessed sputum microscopy with fluorescein diacetate (FDA, evaluating M. tuberculosis metabolic activity) for predicting infectiousness. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was quantified in pretreatment sputum {{of patients with}} pulmonary tuberculosis using FDA microscopy, culture, and acid-fast microscopy. These 35 patients’ 209 household contacts were followed with prevalence surveys for tuberculosis disease for 6 years. Results. FDA microscopy was positive for a median of 119 (interquartile range [IQR], 47 – 386) bacteria/µL sputum, which was 5. 1 % (IQR, 2. 4 %– 11 %) the concentration of acid-fast microscopy–positive bacteria (2069 [IQR, 1358 – 3734] bacteria/μL). Tuberculosis was diagnosed during follow-up in 6. 4 % (13 / 209) of contacts. For patients with lower than median concentration of FDA microscopy–positive M. tuberculosis, 10 % of their contacts developed tuberculosis. This was significantly more than 2. 7 % of the contacts of patients with higher than median FDA microscopy results (crude hazard ratio [HR], 3. 8; P =. 03). This association maintained statistical significance after adjusting for disease severity, chemoprophylaxis, drug resistance, and social determinants (adjusted HR, 3. 9; P =. 02). Conclusions.

The mean age was 61 years, with a lifetime coal mine dust exposure of 18. 7 years. Results showed that chest radiographs of coal workers' simple pneumoconiosis contained small irregular linear opacities more frequently (47 %) than small rounded opacities. Sparse profusion of all small opacities was the rule. Small opacities involved two out of six lung zones simultaneously 39 % of the time while other combinations occurred less frequently. Lower zones were involved more frequently than upper ones. Thickened pleura occurred in 18 % of radiographs. Other frequent radiographic abnormalities were parenchymal calcifications (19 %), marked emphysema (12 %), and <b>inactive</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (12 %). Calcification of the aortic knob, a degenerative process reflecting age, occurred in 9 %. Only one instance of complicated coal workers' pneumoconiosis (progressive massive fibrosis) was encountered (0. 7 %). Many of the descriptive features of coal workers' pneumoconiosis noted in the literature were not observed in this study. Only one instance of complicated pneumoconiosis was encountered...|$|E
40|$|Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is a vasoactive, mitogenic peptide that is variably {{increased}} in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) and immunohistochemically found in lung tissue {{of patients with}} Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). To assess if endogenous ET- 1 production is {{increased in}} ILD we evaluated 24 hour (24 h) urine excretion of ET- 1 in 20 patients with ILD and 10 healthy age-matched controls (HC). Eight patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis (S), 6 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 6 with focal lung fibrosis due to <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (hTB) were studied. Plasma ET- 1 levels (ET- 1 pl, pg/ml) and 24 h ET- 1 levels in urine (ET- 1 ur, ng/ 24 h) were measured by a specific radio-immunoassay. Determinations of ET- 1 p 1 and ET- 1 ur were repeated in S and IPF patients after 30 days of prednisone (0. 75 mg/kg/day) treatment. ET- 1 p 1 concentrations were not different between HC (5. 34 +/- 0. 48), S (5. 95 +/- 0. 96), IPF (4. 75 +/- 1. 37) and hTB (5. 97 +/- 1. 05) groups. ET- 1 ur was significantly higher in S (189. 50 +/- 60. 57) than in HC (69. 00 +/- 10. 76), IPF (62. 17 +/- 19. 07) and hTB (82. 00 +/- 24. 97). After prednisone, ET- 1 ur in the S group decreased significantly (189. 50 +/- 60. 57 to 94. 00 +/- 13. 60), and the decrease paralleled the improved clinical status. In S patients, ET- 1 ur was not significantly correlated {{to the degree of}} respiratory impairment, but it was significantly correlated to the intensity of lymphocytic alveolitis (r = 0. 80) ...|$|R
40|$|Humoral and {{lymphocyte}} {{responses to}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate antigens were studied in active pulmonary tuberculosis (ATB) cases (n = 62), <b>inactive</b> (cured/quiescent) <b>tuberculosis</b> (ITB) patients (n = 62) and healthy control subjects (n = 60). Active tuberculosis patients showed very high antibody titre to M. tuberculosis culture filtrate antigens {{as compared to}} ITB and control subjects. M. tuberculosis antigens from 17 to 80 kDa were recognised by the plasma of all ATB and ITB patients as well as control subjects. However, the 38, 32 - 34, 30 - 31 and 27 kDa antigens were recognised more by the ATB patients {{as compared to the}} control subjects while the 64 / 66 kDa antigen was mostly recognised by the cured patients. Increased lymphocyte responses were seen with increasing concentrations of M. tuberculosis culture filtrate antigens and mitogens such as Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Concanavalin-A (Con-A) in ATB and ITB patients as well as healthy control subjects. However, a low or suppressed lymphocyte response to PHA, Con-A and M. tuberculosis culture filtrate antigens was seen in ATB patients compared to ITB patients and control subjects. The study suggests that during the active stage of the disease, the humoral immune response is augmented but the antigen and mitogen induced lymphocyte response (an in vitro correlate of CMI response) is suppressed. This further suggests that the humoral immune response regulates the CMI response during the active stage of the disease; when the disease is cured, the antibody response declines and the lymphocyte response to antigens and mitogens increases to the same level as found in controls. This suggests that normal immune status gets restored in cured patients...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL- 12 stimulate, and that IL- 10, TGF-β, and IL- 4 suppress the protective immune response against tuberculosis. We aim to evaluate changes in the serum levels of pro and antiinflammatory cytokines in active pulmonary tuberculosis (APTB) and the possible effects of treatment on these changes. Serum IL- 12 p 40, IL- 4, IL- 10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β 1 levels were determined in 20 APTB cases (group 1) before and 2, 4, and 6 months after therapy. The same parameters were also determined in 9 <b>inactive</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (IPTB) cases (group 2) and 9 healthy controls (HC, group 3). Before treatment, the mean serum IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL- 10 levels in group 1 were statistically higher than those in group 2 (P =. 001, P =. 024, P =. 016, resp) or group 3 (P =. 003, P =. 002, P =. 011, resp). The levels in group 1 decreased significantly after treatment (P =. 001 for IFN-γ, P =. 004 for TNF-α, P =. 000 for IL- 10). The serum levels of IL- 12 p 40 were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 3 (P =. 012) and decreased insignificantly after treatment. There was no difference in serum IL- 4 and TGF-β 1 levels among the groups (P >. 05). Because the serum IL- 12 p 40, IL- 10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels were high in APTB, we believe that these cytokines have important roles in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis). These parameters could be used in follow-up as indicators of the success of APTB therapy...|$|R
