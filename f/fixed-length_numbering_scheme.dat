50|$|Some countries, such as Uruguay, have merged variable-length area {{codes and}} {{telephone}} <b>numbers</b> into <b>fixed-length</b> <b>numbers</b> that {{must always be}} dialed independently of location. In such closed dialing plans, also having a closed numbering plan, the area code is formally not distinguished in the telephone number. In the UK, area codes were first known as subscriber trunk dialling (STD) codes. Depending on local dialing plans, they are often necessary only when dialed from outside the code area or from mobile phones. In North America ten-digit dialing is required in areas with overlay plans.|$|R

The recording format was a highly reliable redundant 10-track design using <b>fixed-length</b> <b>numbered</b> data [...] "blocks" [...] organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape {{as though it were a}} disk drive. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Most of the XML query {{processing}} {{strategies are}} based on some <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes.</b> Nodes on the XML tree will be assigned a unique code by the <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme,</b> and ancestor-descendant relationship could be directly told through the codes. The most famous <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme</b> is Region Based <b>Numbering</b> <b>Scheme.</b> However, XML data will be updated. Once the data is updated, the region code should be adjusted to keep the indexing and query processing techniques working. Unfortunately, {{few studies have been}} reported {{on the issue of the}} <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme.</b> This paper focuses on this issue, proposing a series of space preserving and updating algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the effectiveness of the algorithms. Key words: XML; numbering scheme; region code; update; reserv...|$|R

40|$|Commonly used in network routing, programming, {{classification}} {{and knowledge}} representation systems, labeling schemes have also interested the XML community. We thus motivate and describe <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes,</b> their applications, {{and the trade}} off between storage capacities and runtime performance. We present a taxonomy of <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> for XML based on the types of supported queries (ancestor, adjacent, etc), the encoding technique, and whether the scheme offers robustness properties according to updates. We describe some of the numbering techniques proposed for XML. We focus on prefixbased schemes. We give a qualitative comparison of the existing <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes,</b> discussing their advantages and drawbacks. Then, we compare their storage requirement and performances. Finally, we consider the new research directions {{that are likely to}} benefit from <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme</b> techniques. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{labeling}} XML nodes {{are the key}} {{design element}} to support generic XML storage and high-efficiency access in relational databases or other reliable stores. In this paper we present a class of hierarchical <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> that combine two prior published schemes [2, 13] by authors of this paper. No schema {{is required for the}} data, and streaming access is supported. Our schemes support fast query processing and fast retrieval of document fragments while supporting insertion of new nodes, or sub-trees, at arbitrary positions within a document, without the need to relabel any old nodes. These insertion capabilities are not supported in other <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> that have appeared in the literature. We also present a detailed quantitative analysis to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the new <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R
