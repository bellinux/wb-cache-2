The infamous Bakaro arms markets has been closed.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|E
25|$|Sōya {{was fully}} {{decommissioned}} in 1978. Her last mission was a farewell tour to communities she had served, including {{the port of}} Hakodate, and photographs exist from this period of well-wishers swarming the ship before her departure. In 1979 Sōya was moored alongside at the Museum of Maritime Science, Tokyo, and remains {{open to the public}} as a museum ship, open daily and generally closed only when typhoons threaten Tokyo. She remains in largely original condition. Her propellers have been removed and placed on deck but her interior is largely intact from Antarctic exploration days. However, as a result of modifications made in the 1950s her superstructure has changed considerably from her appearance during World War II. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> the tall funnel and aft crane assembly, while the addition of a helicopter landing deck and higher forward gunwales give her a beefier appearance than the cargo ship she started out as.|$|E
500|$|... 1969 brought another {{change to}} Jamaican popular music {{in which the}} beat slowed down even further. [...] The new beat was a slow, steady, ticking rhythm that was first heard on the Maytals song [...] "Do the Reggay." [...] Marley {{approached}} producer Leslie Kong, who was {{regarded as one of}} the major developers of the reggae sound. For the recordings, Kong combined the Wailers with his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars, which consisted of the bassists Lloyd Parks and Jackie Jackson, the drummer Paul Douglas, the keyboard players Gladstone Anderson and Winston Wright, and the guitarists Rad Bryan, Lynn Taitt, and Hux Brown. [...] As David Moskowitz writes, [...] "The tracks recorded in this session illustrated the Wailers’ earliest efforts in the new reggae style. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> the ska trumpets and saxophones of the earlier songs, with instrumental breaks now being played by the electric guitar." [...] The songs recorded would be released as the album The Best of The Wailers, including tracks [...] "Soul Shakedown Party," [...] "Stop That Train," [...] "Caution," [...] "Go Tell It on the Mountain," [...] "Soon Come," [...] "Can’t You See," [...] "Soul Captives," [...] "Cheer Up," [...] "Back Out," [...] and [...] "Do It Twice".|$|E

500|$|The Late Woodland Period {{was once}} {{considered}} to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity. Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, {{but this does not}} appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. [...] Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize. Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, goosefoot, little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade. [...] The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa. At Rainbow, a large house was excavated, showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families. Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group.|$|E

2500|$|A more {{condensed}} {{version of}} this painting with four figures, long {{thought to be the}} second version of The Card Players, is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At 65.4 x 81.9cm (25 3/4 x 32 1/4 in), it is less than half the size of the Barnes painting. Here the composition remains virtually the same, minus the boy, with viewers' perspective slightly closer to the game, but with less space between the figures. In the previous painting, the center player as well as the boy were hatless, whereas this version has all the men hatted. Also <b>gone</b> <b>are</b> the shelf to the left with vase and lower half of a picture frame {{in the center of the}} wall, leaving only the four pipes and hanging cloth to join the smoking man behind the card players.

The Prom Ballroom and Treasure Inn in Saint Paul and the Marigold Ballroom and the Flame Cafe in Minneapolis featured prominent jazz, rock, country and other bands in the mid-20th century.

2500|$|In 1980, Rekha {{appeared}} in the comedy Khubsoorat, directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, {{with whom she had}} developed a strong father-daughter bond during their previous collaborations. In a role written specially for her, she played Manju Dayal, a young vivacious woman who visits her recently married sister at her in-law's house and tries to bring joy to the wide family, much to the displeasure of the matriarch of the household. Rekha said she easily identified with the bubbly nature of her character, calling it [...] "quite a bit me". Khubsoorat was a success and Rekha was appreciated for her comic timing. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Rekha won her first Best Actress award. The Tribune described the film as [...] "a lively comedy," [...] noting that [...] "Rekha's spunky performance gives the film its natural zing." [...] Film World magazine reported in that same year, [...] "Rekha's done it. Smoothly, successfully. From a plump, pelvis-jerking, cleavage-flashing temptress, she has metamorphosed into a sleek, accomplished actress. <b>Gone</b> <b>are</b> most of the inane mannerisms, pouts, wiggles and giggles." [...] It further noted that her career prospects had begun to improve significantly, as leading filmmakers had started taking more notice of her and become more keen to cast her in their films.|$|E
