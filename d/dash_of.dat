25|$|Having reorganised {{his regular}} forces, Allenby won the Third Battle of Gaza (31 October – 7 November 1917) by {{surprising}} the defenders with an attack at Beersheba.

After that, one brave intelligence officer, Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, rode {{right up to the}} Turkish line, barely evading capture. In the fray, he dropped a bloodstained bag, smeared with horse blood, with fake military plans in it. The plans falsely described how the British force {{was on its way to}} capture Gaza. Additional radio messages threatening Meinertzhagen made up the Turkish Army’s mind: the British Army was going to attack Gaza. Instead, they went through with the capture of Beersheba. “The Turks at Beersheba were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise, a surprise from which the <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> London troops and Yeomanry, finely supported by their artillery, never gave them time to recover.
