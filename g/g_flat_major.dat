500|$|... "How Will I Know" [...] is {{composed}} in a 1980s dance beat. Rolling Stone described the song as [...] "perky synth-funk". According to Kyle Anderson of MTV, the song found Houston hitting an [...] "incredible groove". It {{is written in}} the key of <b>G</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major.</b> The beat is set the time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song also has the sequence of G-Bm7-G/C-D-Em-D as its chord progression. Houston's vocals in the song span from the note of E4 to the high note of G5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern whether a boy she likes will ever like her back. She is also hesitant, because her friends tell her [...] "love can be deceiving", and she is so shy that she cannot phone him. Later, she feels {{that it might be}} a dream, but realizes that [...] "there's no mistaking", and that what she feels is really love.|$|E
500|$|... "Better in Time" [...] is a pop and R song set {{in common}} time {{composed}} {{in a moderate}} tempo of eighty beats per minute, in the key of <b>G</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> with a vocal range from the tone of C4 to the note of B5. The song has a sequence of G–Bm–Em–G/D–C as its chord progression. Lyrically the song talks about someone who cannot forget her ex-partner, {{and at the end}} the protagonist knows that [...] "it will all get better in time". Andrea Martin and J. R. Rotem wrote the song, and Rotem composed and produced it. On 29 January 2008, Lewis announced on her website that [...] "Better in Time", along with [...] "Footprints in the Sand", would be released as a double A-side single on 10 March 2010, as her third single in the United Kingdom, with 2008 Sport Relief, a biennial charity organised by Comic Relief and BBC Sport, selecting [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] as their official single. It was also her second international single. A new remix of the song was created for the single release. The double A-side was released with another song, [...] "You Bring Me Down", as a B-side.|$|E

5000|$|Lockwood also discerns a {{precedent}} set by Mozart involving formal structure: an Introduzione; i.e. Beethoven's scene forms a separable initial section of an opera having {{some degree of}} integrity of both plot and harmonic plan; Lockwood calls the Introduzione a [...] "miniplay". Three of Mozart's operas begin with such an Introduzione: Don Giovanni, Così fan tutte, and The Magic Flute. Beethoven's Introduzione has a harmonic structure echoing that of The Magic Flute. The downward sequence of keys given above (<b>g</b> minor, E <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> c minor, <b>G</b> major) echoes the upward sequence of similar keys in the Introduzione section of The Magic Flute: c minor, E <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> <b>G</b> major, C major.|$|R

5000|$|The 11-minute Allegro moderato first {{movement}} varies between D minor, E-flat {{minor and}} F major.

5000|$|The third {{movement}} (presto) {{begins with}} the three notes of the C minor triad in a C-G-C-E flat pattern. This upwards moving passage then moves down from E flat to C then repeats the opening pattern with different notes, D-G-D-F and then descends from F to D and then returns to E flat. In order to complete this opening passage there is a downwards scale from E- flat to C and then leave the opening {{in a state of}} resolution, there is a final four note pattern, B natural-C-D and finally to G, the dominant. This is then repeated an octave lower. Throughout this, the left hand is playing short, staccato accompanying quarter notes whereas the right, which was discussed above, is playing eighth note tuplet. After the opening passage is complete, there is the a series of broken C major chords one octave above from where the opening passage ended. Each of these broken chords are repeated twice, modulating from C major to F minor to B <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and finally, to E <b>flat</b> <b>major.</b> Once reaching E <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> the relative major of C minor, there is a downwards scale continuing until reaching G, an octave lower. From this point, a new pattern emerges, consisting of the three notes: F, <b>G,</b> A <b>flat</b> and B flat. The notes are arranged in a G-A flat-B flat F-G-A flat pattern, which is repeated twice. After this pattern, a broken E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> tonic chord is played, followed by another downwards scale once again beginning on C and continuing to a low F. Following the scale is a final closing pattern, one which is not heard in again in the piece. The closing bar ends with a broken E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> chord beginning on G followed by the three notes C - A <b>flat</b> - <b>G</b> and closes in a E <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> cadence.
