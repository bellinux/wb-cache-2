5|$|Saturday (2005) is a {{novel by}} Ian McEwan set in Fitzrovia, London, on Saturday, 15 February 2003, as a large {{demonstration}} is taking place against the United States' 2003 invasion of Iraq. The protagonist, Henry Perowne, a 48-year-old neurosurgeon, has planned a series of chores and pleasures culminating in a family dinner in the evening. As he <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> his day, he ponders {{the meaning of the}} protest and the problems that inspired it; however, the day is disrupted by an encounter with a violent, troubled man.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|With {{lead singer}} Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) no longer part of New Directions, the McKinley High glee club, {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) grows {{concerned about the}} club's forthcoming performance at Invitationals. He discovers that April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), {{a member of the}} club during his own high school days, never actually graduated, and convinces her to return to school in order to get her diploma and join the glee club. Having failed to achieve her Broadway dreams, April is now an alcoholic, and <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> winning the favor of the existing club members by unconventional means, including getting Kurt (Chris Colfer) drunk and teaching Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) to shoplift. After guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) warns Will that April is corrupting the students, Will asks April to become sober, and she vows to do so.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{aesthetic}} and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation {{as a work}} of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote Revelation: Vision of a Just World from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.|$|E

The consent of the bride is mandatory. Hadith The Islamic marriage is then declared publicly, in , aa'laan, by a responsible person after delivering a sermon to counsel and guide the couple. It is not required, though customary, that the person marrying the couple should be religiously qualified. The bridegroom can deliver the sermon himself {{in the presence of}} representatives of both sides if he is religiously educated, as the story <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> Imam Muhammad bin Ali around 829 AD and recently in Kashmir in 2013 AD by Muhammad Asif bin Ali more than eleven centuries later. It is typically followed by a celebratory reception in line with the couple's or local customs, which could either last a couple of hours or precede the wedding and conclude several days after the ceremony.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E

Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out [...] "to do the right thing" [...] when his sister goes missing, and <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> it as a [...] "lone wolf" [...] who wants to take on the responsibility alone. Adjustments were made to the filming schedule to accommodate Aaron Yoo, who portrays Chewie. Yoo had his appendix removed shortly before filming began, and could not film his scenes immediately.

500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} in the 1896 season, Hogan {{apparently}} secured his release from the Browns. Once again, however, his physical speed offered no guarantee of consistency on the playing field. [...] On July 21, 1896, the St. Paul (Minneapolis) Globe reported that Hogan had performed poorly in a contest between the Hoosiers and the local ball club. [...] "Marty Hogan...made a bad fumble, and then {{looked up at the sky}} to see if it had moved while he was locating the ball", the paper reported. [...] "It was a good bluff, but the crowd discovered Marty's weakness before the end of the game". [...] In January 1897, the Vindicator reported that the Hoosiers had sold Hogan to a club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [...] The article called Hogan [...] "one of the fastest outfielders and baserunners in the Western League" [...] and predicted he would [...] "greatly strengthen the Grand Rapids outfield". [...] The following month, however, the paper described the previous report as a [...] "mistake", indicating instead that Hogan had signed a contract with baseball executive John T. Brush to play with the Hoosiers for another year. [...] The paper also reported that the contract granted Hogan [...] "the largest salary he has ever drawn". [...] Despite this lucrative contract, Hogan established and maintained his own advertising distribution agency in Indianapolis. [...] "He <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> the streets dressed much like an English costermonger", Sporting Life reported in January 1897. [...] "Marty can be seen with a little red wagon full of signs and advertising matter chasing up and down streets nailing the signs to buildings and convenient places and distributing advertising literature in the reel-dance portion of Indianapolis". [...] Less than four months later, in May 1897, he was released by the Indianapolis ball club. In June 1897, the Kansas City Journal indicated Hogan had moved on to the Dayton (Ohio) Old Soldiers, a team affiliated with the Class B Interstate League, where he was [...] "playing a sensational center field". In October of the same year, Sporting Life speculated Hogan would remain with Dayton during the upcoming 1898 season. [...] "Marty Hogan's contract with Dayton is such that he cannot be reserved, as are the rest of the players", the article stated. [...] "Unless Marty has a better offer to play with some other team it is safe to say that he will be with Dayton next year". [...] Further research is required to determine how long Hogan continued to play as an outfielder in the minor leagues. [...] (His obituary indicated that he also worked as a major league trainer.) [...] During his playing career, he apparently received at least one serious injury. [...] In February 1903, Sporting Life reported that the former baseball player's friends were [...] "anxious to get him appointed on the staff of American League umpires". [...] The article added, [...] "Hogan has suffered from operations to remove portions of his breast bone, which was injured in a collision during a baseball game".|$|E
