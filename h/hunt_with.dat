A {{different}} version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib ("Gift to the Rider"), to the Banu Azd people {{when they came to}} pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every <b>hunt</b> <b>with</b> him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.|$|E

5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the <b>hunt</b> <b>with</b> group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E

5|$|Commando Hunt VII {{came to a}} {{close with}} the {{launching}} of the PAVN offensive mentioned above. This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando <b>Hunt.</b> <b>With</b> the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer <b>hunt</b> <b>with</b> the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E
5000|$|The ban on <b>hunting</b> <b>with</b> hounds was unpopular {{with the}} aristocracy, {{many of whom}} <b>hunted</b> <b>with</b> hounds on horseback. Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859-1941), the {{grandson}} of Queen Victoria, who was a keen hunter of the wild boar was powerless to stop the changes as he had abdicated and fled the country in 1918. The remaining upper classes were unable to oppose the totalitarian regime. The Nazi-era ban on <b>hunting</b> <b>with</b> hounds was passed and remains in force to this day.|$|R

Rates of encountering and killing prey were compared for a <b>hunting</b> party <b>with</b> five goshawks and, one week later, a <b>hunting</b> party <b>with</b> five guns on the same land in Croatia.

Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
