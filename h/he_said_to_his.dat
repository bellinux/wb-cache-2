25|$|Horthy clearly saw {{his country}} as trapped between two {{stronger}} powers, {{both of them}} dangerous; evidently he considered Hitler to be the more manageable of the two, at least at first. Hitler was able to wield greater influence over Hungary than the Soviet Union could — not only as the country's major trading partner, but also because he could assist with two of Horthy's key ambitions: maintaining Hungarian sovereignty and satisfying the nationwide yearning to recover former Hungarian lands. Horthy's strategy was one of cautious, sometimes even grudging, alliance. The {{means by which the}} regent granted or resisted Hitler's demands, especially with regard to Hungarian military action and the treatment of Hungary's Jews, remain the central criteria by which his career has been judged. Horthy's relationship with Hitler was, by his own account, a tense one – largely due, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> unwillingness to bend his nation's policies to the German leader's desires.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, Austrian {{psychoanalyst}} Sigmund Freud felt {{a special}} connection to Balzac's novel, since he believed that his world was shrinking like Valentin's talisman. Diagnosed with a fatal tumor, Freud resolved to commit suicide. After re-reading La Peau de chagrin, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> doctor: [...] "This was the proper book for me to read; it deals with shrinking and starvation." [...] The next day, his doctor administered a lethal dose of morphine, and Freud died.|$|E

The next month, Moon entered the 2010 World Series of Poker no-limit Texas hold-em Main Event. Early in the tournament, Moon doubled up with pocket kings against a player with pocket jacks. He was eliminated on day two, however, after moving all in with [...] on a [...] flop. His opponent had pocket aces, and Moon received no help with a [...] turn and [...] river. Leaving the poker room, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife, [...] "At least the pressure's off, honey." ...|$|E

500|$|Model's {{decision}} {{ended the}} war for his men, but he [...] had little desire to witness the aftermath of defeat. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> staff before dissolving his command: [...] "Has everything been done to justify our actions {{in the light of}} history? What can there be left for a commander in defeat? In antiquity they took poison". His decision to commit suicide was sealed when he learned that the Soviets had indicted him for war crimes, specifically the deaths of 577,000 people in concentration camps in Latvia and the deportation of 175,000 others as slave labor. He shot himself in the head in a forest on 21 April 1945. The site of the event, between Duisburg and the village of Lintorf, is today part of the city of Ratingen.|$|E
500|$|Pipe Dream premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955, at the Shubert Theatre, with Helen Traubel as Fauna, William Johnson as Doc, Judy Tyler as Suzy, George D. Wallace as Mac and Mike Kellin as Hazel. The {{show had}} {{received}} the largest advance ticket sale in Broadway history to that point, $1.2million. Some of Steinbeck's ill-feeling was removed on the second night, which he attended and then went backstage to greet the cast. After a celebratory dinner at Sardi's during which the manager sent champagne to his table, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife Elaine, [...] "Isn't the theatre marvelous?" [...] The author held no grudge; he later told Hammerstein that he accepted that Rodgers and Hammerstein were ultimately responsible for the show and {{had the right to}} make changes.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Hitler {{appointed}} Speer as [...] {{with the}} rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government. The position carried with it extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government and made Speer answerable to Hitler alone. It also made Speer {{a member of the}} Reichstag, though the body by then had little effective power. Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to rebuild Berlin. The plans centered on a three-mile long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the Prachtstrasse, or Street of Magnificence; he also referred to it as the [...] "North-South Axis". At the northern end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the Volkshalle, a huge assembly hall with a dome which would have been over [...] high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At {{the southern end of the}} avenue a great triumphal arch would rise; it would be almost [...] high, and able to fit the Arc de Triomphe inside its opening. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans. Part of the land for the boulevard was to be obtained by consolidating Berlin's railway system. Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the Prachtstrasse. When Speer's father saw the model for the new Berlin, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son, [...] "You've all gone completely insane." ...|$|E

500|$|A North American tour, the band's {{first since}} 1977, was {{scheduled}} to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham {{was picked up by}} Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (between 16 and 24 oz.), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> assistant, [...] "breakfast". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house—the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.|$|E
500|$|Almost unanimously, {{the army}} applauded the Night of the Long Knives, {{even though the}} generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. The ailing President Hindenburg, Germany's highly revered {{military}} hero, sent a telegram expressing his [...] "profoundly felt gratitude" [...] and he congratulated Hitler for [...] "nipping treason in the bud". General von Reichenau {{went so far as}} to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on July 13 justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Ernst Röhm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. François-Poncet was not declared persona non grata as would have been usual if an Ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government. The army's support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realise this: [...] "if you look on without lifting a finger," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend, General Werner von Fritsch, [...] "you will meet the same fate sooner or later." [...] Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, after {{surviving}} {{the war in}} Rumania, Rabbi Yakov Yosef came to the United States.

2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} this cable, Eisenhower, {{who frequently}} was very animated, {{was quiet and}} depressed.

Eisenhower then accepted Dulles's argument that the congressional leadership needed to be briefed on the U-2 missions from the last four years. Dulles told the legislature that all U-2 flights were used for aerial espionage and had been flown pursuant to [...] "presidential directives." [...] Still, Dulles played down Eisenhower's direct role in approving every previous U-2 flight.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his series}} of {{consecutive}} championships {{he retired in}} 1958, following the Grand Prix de l'ACF. Such was the respect for Fangio, that during that final race, race leader Hawthorn had lapped Fangio and as Hawthorn was about to cross the line, he braked and allowed Fangio through so he could complete the 50-lap distance in his final race. He would cross the line over two minutes down on Hawthorn. Getting out of the Maserati after the race, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mechanic simply, [...] "It is finished." [...] He was famous for winning a race at the slowest possible speed. He won 24 World Championship Grands Prix from 52 entries – a winning percentage of 46.15%, {{the best in the}} sport's history (Alberto Ascari, who is second best, holds a winning percentage of 40.63%).|$|E
2500|$|For Wittgenstein, who {{highly valued}} {{precision}} and discipline, contemporary music was never considered acceptable at all. [...] "Music," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Drury in 1930, [...] "came {{to a full}} stop with Brahms; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery." [...] Wittgenstein himself had absolute pitch, and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life: he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages. He also learnt to play the clarinet in his thirties. A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered {{in one of his}} 1931 notebooks, by Michael Nedo, Director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.|$|E
2500|$|During his National Service, he was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Horse Guards {{and served in}} Cyprus, where he was almost killed in a machine gun accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car which he drove frequently, he seized {{the end of the}} barrel and shook it, accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through his chest. As a result of his injuries, he lost his spleen, one lung, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections {{for the rest of his}} life. While lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> platoon sergeant: [...] "Kiss me, Chudleigh." [...] He later recalled that [...] "Chudleigh did not recognise the allusion and from then on treated me with extreme caution." [...] He was first treated for his injuries at Nicosia General Hospital. While recuperating from the accident in Italy, he began his first novel, The Foxglove Saga.|$|E
