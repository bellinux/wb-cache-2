50|$|After a BC derailment, CN {{introduced}} ditch lights, lights {{mounted on}} or {{just below the}} anti-climbers on the <b>front</b> <b>pilot</b> of a locomotive. These are used to make trains more visible at grade-crossings, and to give better visibility around curves. Since then, ditch lights have become standard features on all North American locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The 0 series (which {{were not}} {{originally}} classified, {{as there was}} no need to distinguish classes of trainset until later) entered service with the start of Tōkaidō Shinkansen operations in October 1964. These units were white with a blue stripe along the windows and another at the bottom of the car body, including the <b>front</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E

50|$|Heydrich was {{decorated}} with the Iron Cross Second (1940) and First (1941) Classes. The number of missions he flew is not known, but {{he was awarded the}} Frontflugspange (<b>Front</b> <b>Pilot</b> Badge) in silver, which usually was awarded after 60 combat missions. According to Ballantine Books' Illustrated History of the Violent Century (1973), Heydrich flew 97 missions in a Bf-110 twin engine fighter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{footboards}} were reconfigured, {{the locomotive}} bell {{was removed from}} the <b>front</b> <b>pilot</b> and mounted midway between the radiator fans and dynamic brake fans, and a roof-mounted beacon and cab air conditioning system was installed. The unit retained its one-piece windshield and nose-mounted classification lights. When all of the modifications were complete, the locomotive was given a fresh coat of Yellowbonnet paint and reassigned as #4633 (all SD26s were given a 100-place [...] "bump" [...] in numbering to reflect their new class).|$|E
50|$|In 1957, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad had {{acquired}} the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis, including its lease of the Western and Atlantic, and began planning {{to restore the}} General to operation for the American Civil War Centennial. In 1959, the General {{was removed from the}} Chattanooga Union Depot and taken to the railroad's South Louisville Shops to be restored. As part of the restoration, the General was given modern air brakes, a modern coupler (only on the tender, the older style coupler on the engine's <b>front</b> <b>pilot</b> remained), and was converted to burn oil. Throughout the 1960s, the engine pulled Louisville and Nashville Combine Car Number 665 as it traveled to various places across the eastern US, including the 1964 New York World's Fair under its own power.|$|E

5000|$|While {{possessing}} a fairly high power rating (total of [...] ), the traction horsepower was rated at [...] while [...] {{was used to}} run the onboard appliances. The GP49 {{is known for its}} slow acceleration, this was due to the radar unit that is mounted under the <b>front</b> <b>pilot</b> to monitor the actual ground speed when the engine is moving to prevent wheel slip. This system is known as EMD's Super Series wheel slip control that was introduced on the GP40X. It tells the engine's computer to slow the speed of the motors to prevent wheel slip. The GP49 is equipped with a 12-645F3B engine with an AR15 alternator rated at 4680 amperes and has four D87 traction motors. Externally the GP49 looks like a GP50 but has two 48" [...] fans above the radiator instead of three as on the GP50, and the engine-room has eight access doors on each side under the Dynamic Brake blister for engine and turbocharger maintenance, while the GP50 has ten.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few months, after home leave, Graf was sent on {{propaganda}} tours across Germany. He was also {{able to meet the}} German national soccer team and went to several of their international matches. On 28 January 1943 Graf took command of Ergänzungs-Jagdgruppe Ost (Fighter Training Group East) [...] based in occupied France. Here newly trained fighter pilots destined for the Eastern Front received their final training from experienced Eastern <b>Front</b> <b>pilots.</b> The main base was at St. Jean d'Angély [...] north of Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast although Graf {{spent most of his time}} at the Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. Graf selected a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 A-5 aircraft for his personal use and lavishly decorated it. Without the stress of aerial combat, Graf was again able to indulge his other great passion: soccer.|$|R
50|$|Rijeka (Yugoslavia) 1990 in the 250cc GP {{a series}} of events that started with Wilco Zeelenberg falling on Saturday, so he did not race on Sunday, hence there was a free space for the race, and Australian Darren Milner, whose time was out of classification, got a chance to race. Rain started and the race was stopped the {{completed}} lap before the accident, but the flags did not show up on time to stop the leading group. On a left hand curve, all the <b>front</b> <b>pilots</b> were at full speed despite rain, including Roth, who collided with Milner who was riding very slow. In fact Reinhold Roth got the 6th place for the race, in the last season he was intended to participate. 2 months after the accident he woke up from the coma. http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/PONS_EZQUERRA/_ALFONSO/AUSTRIA/Sito/Pons/moto/fue/delante/produje/lesiones/elpepidep/19900619elpepidep_27/Tes/20 years after, he is still hemiplegic.|$|R
5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel Konstantin Alekseyevich Krasavin (Константин Алексеевич Красавин) (May 20, 1917 - January 1988) was a Russian flying ace and {{fighter pilot}} of the Great Patriotic War, {{during which he}} flew for the Soviet air forces. [...] He is {{credited}} with 376 sorties, 106 dogfights and 21 kills between 1941 and 1945 on the Eastern <b>Front,</b> <b>piloting</b> the Yakovlev Yak-3, the Lavochkin La-5, the Yakovlev Yak-7 and the Hawker Hurricane during which time he held the rank of Major. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union along with the Order of Lenin for military valour in 1946 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, retiring from military service in 1955. His citation for his Gold Star medal read that [...] "wherever Comrade Krasavin is with his group of fighters, there is victory over the enemy".|$|R
50|$|The {{advanced}} aviation {{schools in}} the U.S. were slow to develop and lacked both aircraft of the type being used at the <b>front</b> and <b>pilots</b> with combat experience to act as instructors. This lack of advance training in the U.S. dictated {{the development of a}} complete course in advanced flying and aerial tactics at Issodun.|$|R

50|$|The Firestar II {{was created}} {{using the same}} {{fuselage}} but adding a small jump seat in the baggage area. The seating is very restricted for the rear seat passenger and their legs are placed beside the <b>front</b> seat <b>pilot.</b> There are no dual controls. The wing used on the Firestar II is taken from the Kolb Twinstar Mk III. In 1999 the two seat option added only US$216 to the Firestar I base price.|$|R

2500|$|In 1913 a three-seater biplane was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} the military project, the Clément-Bayard No. 6. It was configured for two observers in <b>front</b> of the <b>pilot,</b> and was powered by either a 4-cyl [...] Clément-Bayard or 4-cylinder Gnome engine.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, a {{production}} order for 125 aircraft {{was placed on}} 3 August 1917. Designated M.1C, this version was fitted with a 110 hp Le Rhône 9J rotary engine and had a Vickers machine gun centrally-mounted in <b>front</b> of the <b>pilot.</b>|$|R

25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed the {{calculation}} of the proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, it was normally not visible to the pilot. In early bombers the bomb aimer was normally positioned in <b>front</b> of the <b>pilot</b> and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for the pilot and bomb aimer to be separated. This led {{to the introduction of}} the pilot direction indicator, or PDI. These typically consisted of a pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small dial). The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in <b>front</b> of the <b>pilot.</b>|$|R
25|$|This design {{concept was}} first {{tested in a}} tubular frame test rig that had two pylons with rotors {{connected}} by a drive shaft with the engine also located at the extreme <b>front.</b> The single <b>pilot</b> sat {{at the rear of}} the open structure.|$|R
50|$|Type A No.2 was {{the second}} {{aircraft}} built differing in having the engine mounted in a mid-gap position in <b>front</b> of the <b>pilot</b> driving a tractor configured propeller and in having interplane ailerons located between {{the upper and lower}} wings for lateral control.|$|R
2500|$|Against these problems, the D.V offered {{very little}} {{improvement}} in performance. <b>Front</b> line <b>pilots</b> were considerably dismayed and many preferred the older D.III; Manfred von Richthofen was particularly {{critical of the}} new aircraft. In a July 1917 letter, he described the D.V as [...] "so obsolete and so ridiculously inferior to the English that one can't do anything with this aircraft". British tests of a captured D.V revealed that the aircraft was slow to manoeuvre, heavy on the controls and tiring to fly.|$|R
