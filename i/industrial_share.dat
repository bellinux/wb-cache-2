40|$|Fama’s (1970) {{efficient}} market hypothesis (EMH) {{and the capital}} asset pricing model (CAPM), jointly ascribed to Markowitz (1952), Treynor (1961), Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Mossin (1966), remain the foundation of most finance and investment courses. This is surprising, given the sustained criticism of the model and its assumptions, and {{is a reflection of}} the elegance and parsimony of the theory over the empirical evidence. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), several authors have examined and noted significant inadequacies relating to the single factor CAPM, particularly with regard to the dual nature (resources versus <b>industrial</b> <b>shares)</b> which characterise this bourse. Van Rensburg and Slaney (1997) advocate the use of a two factor arbitrage pricing theory (APT) model, but show that (at least for <b>industrial</b> <b>shares),</b> additional parameters are required (Van Rensburg, 2001). We revisit this ground using an improved methodology and data set over the period 31 December 1986 to 31 December 2011. We find that portfolios constructed on the basis of ranked beta exhibit a monotonic, inverse relationship to what the CAPM prescribes for most of the time-series. The use of the single beta CAPM is therefore inappropriate. [URL]...|$|R

30|$|First, the {{variable}} T {{was not found}} to be significant in the direct effect model. Combining the above analyses, over the sample period, the direct effect of the technology level on energy consumption was found to be insignificant. The main reasons for the increase in total energy consumption in China were increasing output, an increasing <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> of output and extensive economic growth, whereas the coal-dominated energy consumption structure was the key factor in the rising energy intensity. The elasticity of the industrial structure with respect to total energy consumption and energy intensity was 1.649 and − 0.857, respectively. This finding reveals that a decline in the <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> of output can reduce total energy consumption and result in environmental benefits. However, {{as a result of its}} inhibiting effect on production, energy consumption per unit of GDP increased, which indicates that under the current conditions, it is critical to optimize the internal industrial structure instead of reducing the <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> of output in the national economy.|$|E

Keeping in view the immense importance of electricity in the industrial sector, the objective of the study revolved around the growth trends of electricity consumption in the industrial sector of Pakistan and its demand function. For this purpose, the time series data from secondary sources were used. The stationarity of the data was checked with ADF test and variables were integrated of order two. Therefore, the model was estimated with ordinary least square method. Results showed that with an increase in price of electricity and oil, the demand for electricity tends to decrease. Moreover, the <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> in GDP was positively related with electricity demand in the country...|$|E

This study examines the growth in <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> liquidity that occurred in Boston over {{the latter half of}} the 19 th century. From primary sources hitherto unused for scholarly investigations, namely the running annual worksheets of securities price fluctuations that underlie broker Joseph Martin's volumes on the history of the Boston stock market, I construct broad-based indices of annual prices and returns for banking and industrial equities, as well as measures of real market capitalization. A series of vector autoregressive models then relate increases in liquidity, as measured by falling par values of industrial shares due to stock splits, write-downs and re-capitalizations, entries, and exits, to advances in prices and capitalizations among traded firms. The findings support the view that increases in participation were important for sustaining Boston as the nation's leading industrial market until finally overtaken by New York sometime around 1900.

30|$|Unlike the {{previous}} studies that evaluate energy efficiency {{on the basis}} of a common frontier, the group TFEE and the TGR allow us to identify whether the primary source of inefficiency is operation or production environment, and provide different policy implications for policy-makers depending on their values. Lower group TFEE means that operational inefficiency given the technology should be improved, while lower TGR means that the existing technology should be replaced state-of-the-art one. This extension allows us to simultaneously estimate inefficiency and its determinants. To investigate determinants of inefficiency, four <b>industrial</b> <b>shares</b> (manufacturing share, wholesale and retail trade share, and service activities share) and three economic and social conditions (share of government services, population density and income per capita) are used as environmental variables (z-variables) in the group TFEE estimation. The metafrontier analysis results identify whether the primary cause for inefficiency is operation or production environment.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{relationship}} between per capita CO 2 emissions and the share of industrial value added in gross domestic product (GDP) for the G- 7 countries is discussed using a novel approach. It is assumed that per capita CO 2 emissions are correspondent to the share of industrial value added in GDP. A model is developed using hidden Markov process to search this initial assumption. In the model, the data for <b>industrial</b> <b>share</b> in GDP are assigned to be the observations, while the data for per capita CO 2 emissions represent the hidden process, which may be then predicted using the ratio of industrial value added to GDP. The data set covers the period from 1970 to 2008 and the model is tested for the G- 7 countries. The study findings show that, except {{in the case of}} Canada, the hidden Markov model performs reasonably well in tracking per capita CO 2 emissions. The study results provide also a basis for a number of policy implications. Carbon emissions Industrial production Hidden Markov models...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} China's {{strategy for}} investing in Europe. While investing in Western Europe is primarily about obtaining access to advanced technologies, investing in Central and Eastern Europe {{is more about}} establishing {{a presence in the}} EU common market and expanding infrastructure-which also fits into the framework of the New Silk Road Initiative. An econometric analysis reveals that the investments largely follow conventional explanatory patterns. If we distinguish between different forms of market access, the determinants become much more specific. A high <b>industrial</b> <b>share,</b> sound institutions, and unit labor costs in the target country all {{have a negative impact on}} investment in new ventures, but not on investment in existing companies. Differing investment patterns, as well as the heterogeneous interests of the EU member states, make it difficult to implement a coordinated response to the Chinese investment offensive. At the very least, however, a kind of reciprocity should be introduced within the framework of an investment protection agreement between the EU and China. This could reduce the growing skepticism surrounding Chinese investment activities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{potential}} for risk reduction by New Zealand farmers through the diversification of their farm asset portfolios to include financial investments such as ordinary <b>industrial</b> <b>shares,</b> government bonds and bank bills. Low correlations between rates of return on farm and these financial assets suggest that significant reduction of income variability might follow their inclusion in farmers' portfolios. Stochastic efficiency analysis is used to analyse alternative portfolios of ordinary shares, government bonds and bank bills and New Zealand farmland, using coefficients of absolute risk aversion derived from a negative exponential utility function. The results suggest that those farmers showing high degrees of risk aversion would gain utility by including financial assets in their portfolios. Deregulation of the New Zealand economy in the 1980 s appeared to reduce the potential gains from diversification. Bonds rather than ordinary shares are the main contributors to portfolios which maximise utility for individuals classified as 'somewhat' risk averse. Copyright 2008 The Authors.
