40|$|A brain-machine {{interface}} (BMI) is {{a particular}} class of human-machine interface (HMI). BMIs have so far been studied mostly as a communication means {{for people who have}} little or no voluntary control of muscle activity. For able-bodied users, such as astronauts, a BMI would only be practical if conceived as an augmenting interface. A method is presented for pointing out effective combinations of HMIs and applications of robotics and automation to space. Latency and throughput are selected as performance measures for a hybrid bionic system (HBS), that is, the combination of a user, a device, and a HMI. We classify and briefly describe HMIs and space applications and then compare the performance of classes of interfaces with the requirements of classes of applications, both in terms of latency and throughput. Regions of overlap correspond to effective combinations. Devices requiring simpler control, such as a rover, a robotic camera, or environmental controls are suitable to be driven by means of BMI technology. Free flyers and other devices with six degrees of freedom can be controlled, but only at low-interactivity levels. More demanding applications require conventional interfaces, although they could be controlled by BMIs once the same levels of performance as currently recorded in animal <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> <b>attained.</b> Robotic arms and manipulators could be the next frontier for noninvasive BMIs. Integrating smart controllers in HBSs could improve interactivity and boost the use of BMI technology in space applications. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{previous}} theoretical approach to the plastic flow of highly refined materials, a physical explanation for diffusion bonding is essayed, which yields closed [...] form equations relating the bonding progress with time, temperature, applied pressure and the constants characterizing the material. Excellent agreement with <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained,</b> with no adjustable parameter. In the novel scheme, diffusion bonding is caused by the interpenetration of the two sufaces at the grain level. The process is driven by the strong tensile stress field induced in the plane of the interface by the plastic deformation in the normal direction. The grain boundaries of each joining surface yield to host grains of the other surface, releasing this way the internally generated tensile stresses.

40|$|Motorbike riders {{are among}} the most {{vulnerable}} road users. The improvement of the protection offered by motorcycle helmets through use of non-conventional energy absorbing materials could significantly reduce the number of motorcyclists’ fatalities. This thesis investigates the coupling of hexagonal aluminium honeycomb with polymeric foams for the design of innovative and safer motorbike helmets. The compressive behaviour and energy absorption properties of two layered foam-honeycomb composites are assessed experimentally. The experiments include quasi-static and impact compressive tests. Experimental outcomes show an increase of the energy absorbed by the two-layered materials with respect to the one provided by foams currently used for the manufacturing of helmets, tested under the same conditions. A finite element model representing the two-layered materials is also proposed. The model is validated against the experimental results. An accurate reproduction of the <b>experiments</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained.</b> A commercially available helmet is then modified to accommodate aluminium honeycombs in the energy absorbing liner, and standard tests are performed. The investigation includes also the testing of unmodified helmets, presenting same geometry and material properties of the prototypes. The experiments consist of impacts against a flat and kerbstone surfaces, as prescribed by standards. The dynamical responses of the prototypes and their commercial counterparts are compared. It is found that for impacts against the kerbstone anvil, the prototypes offer a noticeable reduction of the accelerations transmitted to the head, compared to the commercial helmets. For impacts against the flat surface, commercial helmets generally provide better protection to the head, which highlights a non optimum design of the prototype helmet and the limitations of using aluminium honeycombs as reinforcement materials. Experimental findings are later used to validate a finite element model of the prototype, where the two-layered model presented in this thesis is implemented. Numerical results are in good agreement with experimental findings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The unusual {{trigonal}} {{prismatic structure}} of tris(butadiene) molybdenum, reported in 1975 by Skell, has been revisited by extensive quantum chemical calculations {{and by a}} low-temperature single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. While a trigonal prismatic coordination arrangement is confirmed by DFT and MP 2 structure optimizations, the calculations provide very different bond lengths than earlier crystallographic studies: Due to appreciable back-bonding, the terminal Mo-C 1 bonds are significantly shorter than the central Mo-C 2 bonds (ca. 2. 29 vs ca. 2. 36 Å), and the central (C 2 -C 2 A) bonds are actually shorter than the terminal ones (ca. 1. 40 vs ca. 1. 44 Å), as found previously for substituted complexes. Similar structures have been computed for tris(butadiene) tungsten and for related, substituted systems. A structure redetermination of tris(butadiene) molybdenum at low temperature shows that the erroneous bond lengths obtained previously are due {{to the presence of}} a disorder resulting from the superposition of two different orientations of the three butadiene ligands with different site occupation factors. Refinement of this disorder results in a physically more plausible orientation of the anisotropic displacement parameter and gives by a factor of 10 improved estimated standard deviations for the geometrical features. A much better agreement between theory and <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained.</b> It <b>is</b> now obvious that resonance structures involving metallacyclopentene rings contribute significantly to bonding.

Two different models were implemented in order to mimic the dependence of the surface excess of the surfactant on the salt concentration. Experimental measurements of kFC were also made, based on the change of the turbidity of the emulsions as a function of time. A satisfactory agreement between theory and <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> only <b>attained</b> if the model of surfactant adsorption accounts for the balance between the salting out of the surfactant solution and the partial screening of the surface charge of the drops induced by the increase of the ionic strength of the continuous phase.

40|$|The wave-induced {{collisions}} and rafting of ice floes are investigated experimentally and theoretically. Results from {{a series}} of wave basin <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> presented. Ice floes are simulated experimentally using thin plastic disks. The first round of experiments focusses on measuring the oscillatory surge, heave, pitch and drift motions of solitary floes. The second and third rounds of experiments record the motions of two adjacent floes. Rafting is suppressed in the second round, and allowed in the third round. Collision and rafting regimes are identified, and collision behaviours are quantified over a range of incident wavelengths and wave amplitudes. Two mathematical models are proposed to model the wave-induced motions of solitary floes. The first is based on slope-sliding theory, and the second is based on linear potential-ow theory. Both models are validated using results from the single-floe experiments. Model-data comparisons show that the slope-sliding model is valid in the long-wavelength regime, and potential-ow model is more accurate in shorter wavelengths.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{nucleation}} phenomena, {{in particular}} the condensation of vapors in presence of a substrate, are studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reported to this date have {{paid little attention to}} the description on the substrate. Here the dynamics of the vapor phase and the surface are simultaneously treated. Two cases are studied: the condensation of argon and the condensation of platinum on polyethylene films. The fundamental difference between both systems is the relative strength of the adsorbate-substrate interactions. The United Atom Method is used to represent the interactions of methyl groups within the polymer. The properties of polyethylene in the bulk phase such as the glass transition temperature, the density and the formation of gauche defects in the crystalline phase can be well described with this model. The interactions between argon atoms can be well represented by the Lennard Jones potential. The Embedded Atom Method is used to describe interactions between platinum atoms since many body effects, important in metals, can be incorporated with a computation requirement similar to pair potentials. Cross interactions between different types of atoms and groups are here approximated by the Lennard Jones potential with Lorentz-Berthelot combining parameters. The aim of this investigation is to describe the dynamics of heterogeneous nucleation and to establish the variables which control the growth and structure formation of clusters on the surface, the nucleation rates, and possible modifications of the substrate during condensation. For this purpose, different conditions of the saturation of the vapor phase and temperature of the substrate were simulated in each of the systems studied. Stationary nucleation rates in vapor phase and on the surface are obtained from cluster size statistics using the method of Yasuoka and Matsumoto. Different growth mechanisms were observed in for the simulated systems. Argon tends to condense on the surface as two-dimensional islands which finally coalesce as layers on the polymer surface. Consistent with this type of growth the condensation in the regime of low saturated and undersaturated vapors can be explained by a two- dimensional model within the frame of the classical nucleation theory. Platinum clusters condense as three-dimensional islands and partially wet the polymer surface. For the first time the embedding of metal atoms and metal clusters growth into a polymer substrate, as observed in <b>experiments,</b> <b>is</b> <b>attained</b> by large-scale molecular simulations. Depending on their sizes, the platinum clusters can diffuse into the polymer matrix even at temperatures lower than the glass transition of the polymer.

Current turbulence models routinely employed by Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD are inconsistent in their prediction of corner flow separation in aircraft juncture regions, so experimental data in the near-wall region of such a configuration will be useful both for assessment as well as for turbulence model improvement. This paper summarizes the Juncture Flow effort to date, including preliminary risk-reduction experiments already conducted and planned future experiments. The requirements and challenges associated with conducting a quality validation test are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Microplot <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of inoculum level and time of application of Paecilomyces lilacinus on the protection of tomato against MeIoidogyne incognita. The best protection against M. incognita <b>was</b> <b>attained</b> with 10 and 20 g of fungus-infested wheat kernels per microplot {{which resulted in a}} threefold and fourfold increase in tomato yield, respectively, compared with tomato plants treated with this nematode alone. Greatest protection against this pathogen <b>was</b> <b>attained</b> when P. lilacinus was delivered into soil 10 days before planting and again at planting. Yield was increased twofold compared with yield in nematode-alone plots and plots with M. incognita plus the fungus. Percentages of P. lilacinus-infected egg masses were greatest in plots treated at midseason or at midseason plus an early application, compared with plots treated with the fungus 10 days before planting and (or) at planting time...|$|R
30|$|After {{loading the}} sample assembly, {{pressure}} is increased {{at a rate}} of 20  bar per hour for high-temperature experiments and 10  bar per hour for room temperature experiments. For the latter, electrical resistance is measured continuously during this compression stage. After the target pressure <b>is</b> <b>attained,</b> high-temperature <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> heated {{at a rate of}} 50  °C per minute to the target temperature. Temperature is held constant at the target value for a minimum of 30  min and up to a few hours. Samples are quenched by switching off the electrical power. When the <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> finished, i.e. after target pressure is achieved for a room temperature experiment or when the module is cooled down to below 50  °C after a high-temperature <b>experiment,</b> pressure <b>is</b> reduced by 10  bar per hour to ambient conditions.|$|R
