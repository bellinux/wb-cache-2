40|$|Before the Great Recession, rising income {{inequality}} within the European Union member {{states has been}} considered to be one driver for an increasing <b>Euroskepticism.</b> Using rich data on attitudes towards European integration from the Eurobarometer (EB) surveys, we revisit the issue by analyzing the relation between macroeconomic indicators, socio-economic background variables, individual attitudes {{and the level of}} <b>Euroskepticism</b> within the 27 EU member states for the period 2006 to 2011.

We find that the increase in <b>Euroskepticism</b> is mostly due to 9 ̆ 3 mood: 9 ̆ 4 the fear of losing cultural identity and financial expectations and by large unrelated to economic background variables like income inequality. We find evidence that negative financial expectations are positively related to <b>Euroskepticism</b> in Western European countries and negatively related to <b>Euroskepticism</b> in Eastern European countries. That suggests that financially pessimistic people in Western Europe might interpret European integration as a threat to their financial situation, while Eastern European people might view it as a chance to improve their economic situation...|$|E
40|$|While {{increasing}} numbers of Europeans are skeptical about the EU, the primary causes behind <b>Euroskepticism</b> vary widely from country to country. Our paper examines the differing sources of <b>Euroskepticism</b> within Hungary and the United Kingdom, using these examples as case studies for the broader EU. Hungarian Euroskeptics accuse the EU of suppressing Hungarian culture and violating the country’s national sovereignty, fostering a growing sense that EU membership has not brought the promised benefits. The primary driving forces behind British <b>Euroskepticism,</b> however, are opposition to intra-EU immigration and {{a sense that the}} island nation is inherently separate from the Continent. The case studies of Hungary and the UK demonstrate that the motives behind <b>Euroskepticism</b> vary widely across the continent.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address {{and move forward}} the debate on these two {{controversial}} theoretical issues. It surveys the current Literature and attempts to draw conclusions {{in terms of where}} the debate has reached. This paper begins by examining the definitional controversies and, {{on the basis of the}} various approaches surveyed, attempts to draw some tentative conclusions about how party-based <b>Euroskepticism</b> should be conceptualized. Section two briefly considers some of the positions and discourses that have, in our view, been wrongly categorized as party-bases <b>Euroskepticism</b> (by ourselves, among others!). Section three examines whether or not (and how) it is possible to "measure" levels of party-based <b>Euroskepticism</b> and critically evaluates our own earlier attempts to try to do so. Finally, section four reflects on the academic debate on what causes party-based <b>Euroskepticism.</b> This has tended to be portrayed (wrongly, in our view) in dichotomous terms as an argument between those who give priority to ideological¬-programmatic impulses on the one hand and those who stress the imperatives of strategic-tactical positioning on the other. It should be stressed that this is very much a summary of research in progress and that the conclusions it reaches are tentative ones.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} Britain’s role within the European Union through an {{analysis}} of the banker bonus cap. British politicians challenged the cap {{on the grounds that the}} required fixed ratio between fixed and variable pay would negatively impact the competitiveness and stability of European financial services in the long-run. While Britain’s legal challenge was primarily motivated by concerns about cap’s effects on London specifically, it also correctly predicted the cap’s detrimental consequences. The decision of the European Court of Justice to reject Britain’s challenge despite its legitimacy reflects the gradual marginalization of British interests within the EU’s policymaking process. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Britain’s relationship with the European Union has further deteriorated as the Eurozone struggles to stabilize its currency union. Meanwhile, <b>Euroskepticism</b> has moved from the periphery of Britain’s political arena to the mainstream. The forces driving Britain and Europe apart are particularly apparent in the realm of financial regulation. British politicians display an increasing tendency to challenge the EU’s efforts to regulate financial services within Europe. The central tension which emerges from this dynamic is that, while <b>Euroskepticism</b> may be driving Britain’s politicians away from political integration with the EU, the success of Britain’s financial services sector remains fundamentally dependent on access to the common market. Ultimately, {{an analysis of}} Britain’s response to the cap in the larger context of its relationship with Europe demonstrates that Britain’s economic wellbeing relies on Britain’s politicians demonstrating a greater willingness to commit to the political dimension of the EU...|$|E

The results show that while federalism is positively correlated with multiple identities, individuals with a single identity {{who live in a}} federation are more Euroskeptic than their counterparts in unitary states. These findings suggest that federalism can either be a response to parochialism or that people in federations may resent the EU for allowing regions with secessionist movements autonomy from the central state...|$|E

The main opposing views on European identity – Eurooptimism and <b>Euroskepticism,</b> can be illustrated and personified by the former President, Mr. Václav Havel, and the current President, Mr. Václav Klaus.

Different political opportunity structures have consequences for far right voter profiles in four important respects. First, the linkage between anti-immigrant attitudes and far right support is stronger in Western Europe. Second, far right voters in Western Europe are less religious than their post-communist counter-parts. Third, post-communist far right voters are economic leftists, whereas rightist attitudes toward income redistribution slightly predict a far right vote in Western Europe. Finally, far right voters in Western Europe are less satisfied with democracy as a regime type...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} activities of the European Union (EU) has been widening the Union, that is, enlargement. Tapping to what extent and why EU citizens support future enlargement rounds has become a popular endeavour among researchers and EU officials.

Based on an experimental survey design, we test the effects of two news frames on support for future Serbian EU candidacy. We find that exposure to news frames has considerable impact on general understanding of Serbian EU candidacy, issue interpretation, and policy support. This effect is moderated by political knowledge. Knowledgeable participants were able to express their thoughts on Serbian EU candidacy more elaborately, whereas low-knowledge individuals were overall more susceptible to framing effects. We discuss the implications of our findings for current debates such as <b>Euroskepticism</b> and decreasing public support for EU integration...|$|E

Kühnhardt examines examples – such as the European notion of civil rights and the notion of the Union itself, but also critical categories such as <b>euroskepticism</b> – which indicate that the EU itself is beginning to be the starting point and frame of reference for a reflection on the common good.

40|$|Eurosceptic tendencies {{have gained}} more {{traction}} than ever before: The successful Brexit-campaign {{came as a}} surprise both to supporters and to opponents. An openly anti-EU-faction is the third largest in the European Parliament. It seems that eurocritical niche-parties are gaining in popularity all over Europe, while mainstream parties appear to be paralyzed from shock about it. Previous research suggests that mainstream-parties react to shifts in public opinion, while niche-parties’ positions are influenced by their supporters. My study adapts this theory, along with ideas of responsible parties versus responsive parties, and applies both to factions in the European Parliament. To do so I consider two kinds of representation. My research finds that neither mainstream-factions nor niche-factions are very responsive to the public or supporters on the issue of European integration. However, <b>Euroskepticism</b> has increased among European electorates in recent years, thereby widening the representation gap for mainstream parties and lessening it for niche parties. It remains unclear the extent to which Euroskeptic parties have {{played a key role in}} mobilizing anti-EU sentiments...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{has suggested that}} nation-states will gradually fade away in favor of regions and super-regions as the main actors within a European Union characterized by strong regional identities. At the same time, recent developments have shown that citizen support for European integration is essential for any future development of the Union. The puzzle inspiring this paper is {{the finding that the}} greatest support for the EU increasingly stems from minority nationalist regions seeking to bypass their central states to achieve their policy goals at the EU level. This paper empirically tests this suggestion, while shedding light on the relationship between the quality of representation of regional interests at the EU level and positive citizen attitudes towards the EU. In particular, it finds two explanations for cross-regional variation in the relationship between <b>Euroskepticism</b> and representation: (1) a cultural explanation, embodied by a difference in the nature and quality of representation between regions that are linguistically distinctive and regions that are not; and (2) an institutional explanation, embodied by a difference in the nature and quality of representation between region...|$|E
40|$|This article {{systematically}} investigates, in {{a comparative}} perspective, {{the support for}} new extreme right-wing political parties (ERPs) in national elections across the Western European Union countries (WEU). The objective of the research is not to explain why or how the ERPs platforms can be convincing and persuasive, but to describe conditions that contribute to identify when this has occurred. Since the reactionary nature of ERP discourse met the spreading phenomenon of <b>Euroskepticism,</b> a vote for ERP candidates and platforms is considered Euroskeptic voting behavior. Our hypothesis is that the greater the political power a member state enjoys in European Union institutions, the fewer the incentives for voters to support ERPs. To test this hypothesis, {{a great amount of}} data was organized and a set of econometric exercises was established using panel data with fixed effects. Given the intertemporal variation captured by the panel data with fixed effects, it is possible to assess the political conditions for the growth of electoral support for ERPs across the WEU as a function of three classes of variables: representative variables, economic variables, and variables of perception. The findings suggest that representation in European institutions has greater impact on ERP support than economic circumstances...|$|E
40|$|A {{debate has}} emerged between S. Hix and S. Bartolini on the {{plausibility}} and desirability of {{the politicization of}} the EU. By this it is usually meant a more important role for mass, competitive, and partisan politics both on the input- (expression of preferences) and on the output- (collectively binding measures and resource allocation) side of the European decision-making system. In this article, we argue that this debate does not sufficiently {{take into consideration the}} consociational nature of the EU. Comparing the EU to other consociational polities such as Belgium and Switzerland, we show that the politicization of the EU is not plausible along a bipolar logic, but that other forms of politicization are both plausible and desirable. We argue that S. Hix’s recipe for politicization is based on some incorrect assumptions and predictions. It is not obvious that the EU is evolving towards more Left-Right polarization. Even if this were the case, the nature of the EU implies that cooperation and compromises are indispensable, therefore Hix’s suggestions will not suffice to clarify political choice and enhance accountability. Hix is not correct in believing that politicization along the Left-Right cleavage will alleviate <b>euroskepticism.</b> He tends to associate the latter with this dimension, which is partly wrong. Moreover, <b>euroskepticism</b> also has a social base (“losers of modernization”) and does not only derive from the deficit of accountability in the EU. At the same time, we think that the consociational nature of the EU also reduces the risks feared by S. Bartolini with regard to the consequences of politicization on governability. The politicization of constitutive issues can even be regarded as necessary, in order to integrate anti-system political entrepreneurs and euroskeptic segments of public opinion. Also Bartolini is only partially right in stressing the destabilizing potential of the politicization of opposition on these issues: it is true that consociational mechanisms are less effective – {{at least in the short}} term – in dealing with this kind of conflict, but it seems to us less risky to rely on them than on non-politicization. As a remedy to the accountability deficit of the EU, consociational-type politicization is nevertheless not a panacea. Therefore we suggest the coupling of a system of politicized “negotiation democracy” with mechanisms of direct participation. With a number of institutional safeguards, such a coupling would help to cope with the limits of consociational systems, would remain compatible with the compound nature of the EU, and would provide value-added in terms of public legitimization of the European integration. accountability; democratization; legitimacy; participation; political parties; political representation; political science; polity building; public opinion; referendum...|$|E
40|$|How {{should the}} recent {{politics}} of <b>euroskepticism</b> in Poland be interpreted? A {{number of important}} domestic parties in Poland {{are considered to be}} both nationalist and Euroskeptic. This is an interesting fact for a number of reasons. First of all, even though these parties are nationalist, they are in some cases active in wider transnational party cooperation arrangements on the European level. Secondly, they seem to represent a deviation from the dominant trend in political mobilization on European matters in Poland in the period before the accession of 2004. During almost the entire decade of the 1990 s the most successful mainstream political actors in Poland had a favorable view of the European integration process and were generally supportive of the idea that the country needed to {{become a member of the}} EU as soon as possible. In 2005, however, a conservative nationalist party called Law and Justice (PiS) won the elections with a moderately Euroskeptic program and formed, in April 2006, a government with two radical anti-EU parties. Positions on Europe were also a topic in the 2007 elections that led to the defeat of the incumbent government parties. This paper explores how we should interpret the development of (transnationalized) euroskeptic positions of these parties in the narrower context of the development of positions, discourses and mobilization strategies in domestic Polish party politics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{how and why}} {{national parliaments}} get involved in policy-making at the EU level. It uses mixed methods to study which tools parliaments use to affect EU policies in certain situations and how these patterns vary across parliaments. I conceive of parliaments and their members as having a ‘parliamentary toolbox’, which contains the different methods of influence that parliaments have over their ministers, national legislation, and now European policy-making. Parliaments vary in the strength {{of each of the}} tools available to them and in the political context and situations they face. I show that these differences lead different parliaments to use different tools and strategies to gain influence. In particular, I argue that the there are three main characteristics that distinguish one parliamentary tool from another. These are how institutionalized and formal it is, how public it is, and the number or type of actors required to use it. For example, involvement in transposition is much more institutionalized and formal than the subject matter of questions or resolutions, so parliaments that are relatively strong as compared to their governments and are {{in a better position to}} push for procedural changes are the ones that are most likely to use this tool. Resolutions and questions are more public, so they are more likely to be used in situations where there is high public <b>Euroskepticism.</b> Since questions are an individual tool, they are more likely to be used when parties are internally divided about EU politics...|$|E

The study basically asked two important questions about Euro-skepticism and answered each question by testing four main hypotheses. The hypotheses were tested on two different parties,,the Nationalist Action Party and the Felicity Party, and on two different events (on December 17, 2004 and on October 03, 2005). Since the study had 4 general hypotheses, the total hypothesis testing occurred 16 times. To be able to prove the hypotheses, the content analysis technique was used on the data that was collected from two newspapers: pro-MHP Ortadogu and pro-SP Milli Gazete. Each hypothesis was tested by using the two sample z-Test formula. The findings show that the two decisions by the EU did not have any impact on religion-based and trust-based Euro-skepticism. Only the first event {{had an impact on the}} nationalism-based Euro-skepticism of both political parties and overall Euro-skepticism of the MHP. The findings showed that 3 of the testing had a negative impact and 13 of them had no impact at all. No positive impact was found at the 0. 05 level. Only one of them, trust-based, showed significance at the 0. 10 level. The results showed that the decisions of the European Union either did not change the Euro-skepticism or if there was a change it was in a negative way.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} political legitimacy of the European integration from a socio-political perspective using a mixed-methods approach, drawing on both quantitative survey data (Eurobarometers) and qualitative data (24 focus groups organized in (French-speaking) Belgium, France and Great-Britain). Through the analysis of this material, {{it is possible to}} contribute {{to the study of the}} processes of acceptance and/or resistance towards European integration, as well as its possible politicization, whilst concentrating more specifically on the non-polarization of a large proportion of ordinary citizens. Thus, next to the resistances generally studied and know as <b>Euroskepticism,</b> one also records during the last decade a reinforcement of the indifference and indecision of ordinary citizens. The systematic analysis of the focus groups makes it possible to point out the fundamental role played by the national frames of perceptions and to precisely document the different faces of non-polarization (ambivalence, distance and externality and fatalism). The conclusion of this paper invites us to question the acceptance of change in the political order by investigating not only the degree of support citizens have for the European political system and the type of support they express, but also at the intensity of this support. Although the contrast between the pre- and post-Maastricht periods in terms of the parallel growth of the competences of the European Union and the publicity around European issues is not called into question, an interpretation based on the binary permissive consensus/euroscepticism appears incomplete if not erroneous. In emphasizing the complexity of the dynamics of politicization, this text suggests that the alleged break in the “permissive consensus” amongst citizens needs to be put into perspective. Thus, it is not clear that the “popular mood” towards Europe is the mirror image of the level of dissensus amongst elites. The politicization of European issues does not necessarily lead to the polarization of citizens opinions; we argue here that it is necessary to incorporate the notion and the role of indifference into any reflection on the legitimacy of the European integration process...|$|E
40|$|The {{erosion of}} popular support that has {{accompanied}} {{the expansion of}} European-level governance {{has given rise to}} interesting debates about the origins of public support for the European Union (EU). The utilitarian explanation that focuses on rational cost-benefit calculations competes with a cultural approach that ties evaluations of the EU to dominant societal values and individual socialization experiences. A third approach regards domestic political dynamics as an important determinant of public support for the EU. Empirical tests of these explanations have been limited almost exclusively to current EU member states, while the growing differentiation of popular attitudes in the Central and Eastern European candidate countries has received much less attention. This dissertation brings the Western European literature to bear on the EU's Eastern enlargement, seeking to explain extensive variations in the level of popular support for the EU both within and across post-communist societies. Hypotheses derived from the utilitarian, cultural and domestic politics explanations are tested with individual- and national-level data from a variety of candidate countries and, for purposes of comparison, three non-applicant Eastern European states. The results lend some support to all three explanations, suggesting that support for the EU is influenced by micro-level expectations of gain, changes in macro-economic conditions, the prevalence of democratic norms, and trust in domestic political incumbents. The dissertation also examines the implications of growing popular <b>euroskepticism</b> for the integration process, situating the discussion of popular attitudes in post-communist societies in the broader discourse on European-level democracy and legitimacy. The dissertation reviews the controversy over which standards of legitimacy are suitable in a non-state polity such as the EU, and presents an overview of the various institutional channels through which European electorates can influence European governance. In sum, the dissertation adds an interesting bottom-up dimension to the predominantly elite-centered study of the Eastern enlargement and contributes to the construction of general theories about the logic of public support for regional integration and international governance...|$|E
40|$|While {{often seen}} and {{presented}} as a panacea for the aging populations of Europe to maintain a functioning welfare state, immigration provokes a very strong public opposition from the host society and substantive inter-group tensions. To tackle this issue in greater detail, in this dissertation, I explore how immigrant groups with different ethnic backgrounds are categorized {{by members of the}} host society and the implications of these classifications on attitudes towards immigration and on European Union integration. Specifically, I challenge the assumption of people's perception of immigrants as a homogenous group as evidenced by the widespread use of a single survey question inquiring about support for overall immigration. I argue that public's perception of immigration is highly heterogeneous, resulting in a hierarchical categorization of immigrants mainly based on cultural similarity cued by ethnicity. I further argue that economic considerations are important but they mainly motivate opposition to immigration of ethnic groups that are perceived culturally similar. However, prejudice and symbolic considerations are the primary cause of opposition to immigrants that are perceived culturally different. I provide strong evidence for the applicability of this model with German General Social Survey data from the year 2006, original in-depth interviews and survey experimental data with an embedded newspaper priming and list experiment that I collected in Berlin between 2007 and 2009. With a rigorous triangulation of methods, I not only show that cultural similarity has a direct and indirect impact on immigration attitudes, but I also demonstrate how this relationship is suppressed by social desirability bias -the respondent's aspiration to give socially desirable answers to "look good" to the researcher-. Finally, regarding the implications of my theory on attitudes towards the EU, I find that separating immigration attitudes by ethnic group reveals that fear of EU enlargement is actually a far more important motive of <b>Euroskepticism</b> than it has been shown so far. Also, when social desirability bias is accounted for, the perceptions of cultural threat due to an enlarged Europe play a much larger role in explaining EU attitudes than conventional survey data suggest...|$|E

Roger Griffini teooria järgi iseloomustab paremäärmuslaste võrgusuhtluse väikeste mitteparteiliste üksuste – grupuskulite (nt veebilehed, blogid) paljusus ja suhteline marginaalsus, rahulolematus praeguse maailmakorraga, ideede revolutsioonilisus ning risoomne ehk mitte-hierarhiline kommunikatsioonistruktuur. Täiendame Griffini teooriat kultuurisemiootika ideedega. Semiosfääri kontseptsioon võimaldab paremini analüüsida grupuskulite kommunikatsiooni eripära ja seal tekkivaid tähendushierarhiaid. Koodteksti mõiste selgitab aga, miks, vaatamata hüpermeedias kättesaadavale arvamuste paljususele, domineerivad grupuskulaarses kommunikatsioonis väga kindlad tähendusloome viisid.     S U M M A R Y The {{purpose of}} this article is to create a {{conceptual}} framework which would aid in the understanding of the characteristic ways the Estonian extreme right has created the prevalent identities and meanings that are currently in circulation in the media. The analysis is based on non-participant observation, by means of which we have attempted to isolate the main foci and dominant practices of self-description found in web communications among members of the Estonian extreme right. Based on the number of visitors to sites, the concentration of topics posted and frequency of citation, we take the following as representatives of extreme right positions: the blogs „The Nationalist“ („Rahvuslane“), „NS“, and „Nationalist“ („Rahvuslik“), and the alternative web pages „Be Aware“ („Ole Teadlik“) and „BHR Ruzzland“. Markers of the extreme right were present in the pages we examined at different levels of intensity; in fact, not every post to these pages clearly, not every page could be labelled as extreme right. Yet the general tonality of the webpages we examined included the following: an urgent need to conserve „core Estonianness“ and protect it from foreign influences; the belief that the world order (including Estonian power structures) are controlled by a secret alliance between Zionists and Masonic orders; the danger of mixing races and cultures; the need to exert strong state control over a range of areas of life; <b>euroskepticism.</b>   According to the authors of this article non-institutionalized extreme right movements operating in hypermedia have been most extensively examined by Roger Griffin’s research. Griffin has developed the concept of the groupuscule, which can be defined as small, political, (though almost never directly partypolitical) unit in the context of contemporary extreme right-wing politics, and which strive toward revolutionary, ideological, organizational, and activist goals, the overall purpose of which is to overcome the decadence of the liberal democratic system.   Groupuscules can have diverse physical manifestations: webpages, magazines, and why not also underground meetings of extreme-right cell groups. Indeed, according to Griffin, groupuscules can be treated as non-nuclear cellular networks without a leader. The communication of groupuscules reflects the characteristics of hypermedia itself: nonhierarchical or network-like structure, internal multiplicity, the lack of a centre or a central axis of organization, fluidity, and temporariness, all of which are most often connected with the abstract textuality of the hypermedia environment.   In our view, the main limitation of Griffin’s account of groupuscules is the undertheorization of communication both within and among groupuscules. Too little attention has been directed to the primary mechanisms of meaning-creation, which organize navigation on the groupuscular information field and the development of hierarchies. In this article we aim to supplement Griffin’s theory of the groupsucule by means of a cultural-semiotic approach, particularly through the concepts of the semiosphere and the code text.   Focusing on meaning-creation by the groupuscular extreme right, one can examine groupuscules communicating in the internet environments as different semiotic wholes, or semiospheres: these can be specific posts, popular discussion topics, or the network as a whole. The semiotic wholeness of a groupuscule is guaranteed by a boundary. By means of the boundary, a groupuscule can distinguish itself from its semiotic other, filter information from outside, and restate this in its own language. Groupuscules of the extreme right bring those people together who use the web medium both for the formation and the confirmation of their personal racial/ethnic identity. Their relatively marginal status as a „public voice“ can be explained by the fact that on the webpages we examined, a dominant strategy for identity formation was creating the image of an extreme rightist as a sufferer or victim. They often presented themselves as persecuted and unjustly excluded from public discussions. In the communications of the Estonian extreme right, the designated antagonists are the mainstream media, the European Union, and its corrupt politicians.   In terms of its internal structure, the groupuscular extreme right is heterogeneous. When a specific groupuscule enters interaction with other extreme right cells, it is no longer identical with itself, since its identity is largely determined by connecting with other groupuscules; that is, its particularity only emerges through communication with other groupuscules. The Estonian extreme right groupuscules we studied are relatively well known publicly in the so-called local counterculture; some of their articles are frequently commented and cited (on the pages we studied, reciprocal reference and quotation was frequent).   However, in every semiotic whole, dominants or nuclei develop, which, compared to more marginal semiotic units are usually more rigidly structured. Similar nuclear structures also play an important role in groupuscular identity formation, where, in the course of communication, certain topics become major themes that unify many groupuscules, and begin to determine the meaning-formation of the semiotic units that belong to it. For example, in the case of the topic of ratification of ACTA (The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement), a reference to extensive corruption among various administrative units of the European Union percolates through the Estonian groupuscules (on a broader level, a reference to the decadence of liberalism and the new world order).   On another level, opinion leaders emerge on the groupuscular field; their postings are read most often, and their ideas are referenced most often. On the Estonian groupuscular field, the most cited sources are the blogs „DeCivitate“ and „The Nationalist“. It seems that if Griffin points out that groupuscular information networks lack a „center-periphery“ relation, then he bases that claim on 1) the technological characteristics that structure the web environment. However, he does not take into account 2) the relativity of the centre-periphery opposition and 3) the hierarchical nature of the processes of signification themselves and their role in organizing groupuscules. We attempt to explain groupuscules’ relatively hermetic meaning-creation by using the cultural-semiotic term code text, which is an invariant system of connections originating in the shared memory of a community, the role of which is conceptualizing specific fragments of information and locating them in habitual patterns of meaning.   The self-descriptions of right-wing groupuscules are largely built around the code text of a conspiracy theory, which allows the representation of one’s ideological opponents as extremely ill-intentioned or ignorant, and themselves, by contrast, as moral and heroic. The code text that narrates the decline of the liberal-democratic world constellates narratives of a conspiratorial world system, in which the cause of every event can be explained by the „evil“ intent of the conspirators. Groupuscules do not limit themselves to passive complaining about the decadence of the prevailing world order; often ideas are expressed of radically reforming this decadent world order, which should in turn lead to the rebirth of nation-states. The specificity of the code text leads participants in the extreme right to perceive causal connections between events that have occurred in different places at different times, and which seem totally unconnectable in the eyes of outsiders. Those phenomena that do not fit the code text, and which could make way for other explanations for sociocultural realities are virtually invisible in the self-descriptions of gropusucules, and are relegated to the periphery as unimportant...|$|E
