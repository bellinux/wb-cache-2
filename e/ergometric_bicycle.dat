40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{information}} concerning the CPK turnover during exercise, we have elaborated a technique to measure its activity continuously in vivo. A colorimetric method has been adapted to total blood. CPK was measured continuously in 5 physically fit athletes exercised on an <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> for 30 min. There was practically no increase in enzymatic activity. The starting level was very high, corresponding perhaps to a "permanent state of enzyme release"; the exercise was not hard enough because of the fitness of the athletes or the maximal increase did not occur immediately after the exercise. © 1976.

O estudo foi transversal e descritivo com a amostra de 54 indivíduos obesos (23 meninos e 31 meninas) e 33 não obesos (16 meninos e 17 meninas) com idade entre 10 e 16 anos. Utilizou-se o critério dos Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2000) para a classificação do índice de massa corporal (IMC). Foram avaliados o peso, estatura, índice de massa corporal (IMC) e IMC-escore Z. Para avaliação cardiorrespiratória foi realizado teste máximo em esteira e bicicleta ergométrica. Foram avaliados a frequência cardíaca máxima (FCmax), coeficiente respiratório (RER), consumo máximo de oxigênio (VO 2 max), tempo total de teste (TT) e carga final (w) na bicicleta ergométrica. Utilizou-se o teste de t de Student para a comparação dos ergômetros. Nas análises dos grupos, utilizou-se a ANOVA fatorial.

The criterion by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2000) was used for classification of body mass index (BMI). Weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and BMI-score Z were assessed. A maximal test on treadmill and <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> was performed for cardiorespiratory assessment. Maximum heart rate (HRmax), respiratory coefficient (REC), maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), test total time (TT) and final load (w) on <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> were assessed. Student's t-test was used for ergometers comparison. Factorial ANOVA was used in the groups'analysis and p< 0. 05 was considered significant. The results revealed that weight, BMI and BMI-score Z were higher in the obese subjects. The absolute VO 2 max (m 1 - 1) values were higher in the obese subjects in both genders on treadmill, with no differences between the bicycle group. However, the VO 2 max concerned with body weight (m 1 kg- 1 min- 1) was lower in the obese group and in girls in both ergometers. The workload on bicycle was similar between obese and non-obese subjects. As a conclusion, the obese subjects presented VO 2 max values lower than the non-obese ones in both ergometers. Nevertheless, the fact that obese subjects can work with the same final load of the non-obese subjects suggests that the bicycle can be considered as the best ergometer for obese individuals...|$|E

Background. Exercise is currently recommended for patients after myocardial infarction; however, the effects of long-term physical training on ventricular size and remodeling still have to be defined. Methods. Patients with no contraindications to exercise were studied 4 to 8 weeks after anterior Q wave myocardial infarction and 6 months later by echocardiography at rest and <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> testing. After the initial study, patients were randomly allocated to a 6 -month exercise training program (n = 49) or a control group (n = 46).

An abnormal systolic blood pressure response in patients with angina pectoris has been observed not only during exercise but also during the recovery period after exercise. However, the mechanisms of this abnormal response during recovery have not been elucidated. Methods. Thirty-five patients with angina pectoris and 17 control subjects underwent <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> studies after insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter. Results. In control subjects, all hemodynamic variables decreased rapidly after exercise. In 7 of the 35 patients, systolic blood pressure increased after exercise. The patients with angina were classified into two groups. In group I (17 patients), changes in systolic blood pressure during recovery were smaller than those in control subjects. In group II (18 patients) recovery of systolic blood pressure was normal. Changes in stroke index from rest to peak exercise were smaller in group I than in group II. Stroke index in both patient groups increased paradoxically during recovery. The increase in systemic vascular resistance index during recovery and the ratio of plasma norepinephrine concen tration to cumulative work load were greater in group I than in group II. Conclusions. An abnormal systolic blood pressure response after physical exercise in patients with angina pectoris is indicative of severe myocardial ischemia during exercise and may be caused by an increase in stroke volume due to recovery from myocardial ischemia and increased systemic vascular resistance secondary to exaggerated sympathetic nervous activity...|$|R

They carried out a triangular Stress Test on <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> according to the Wasserman protocol. We measured simple response time (SRT) and complicated (CTR) before and after the maximum test using the Superlab software (version 7. 01). The sports specialities were: athletics 21 (30 %), judo 20 (28. 6 %), karate 16 (22. 9 %), game of bowls 7 (10 %) and gymnastics (8. 5 %). ResultsThe simple response time (SRT) was on average 345. 82 ms± 41. 92 before the stress test and 349. 35 ms± 48. 44 after the test; with a non-significant difference (p= 0. 64). The error rate decreased after the exercise in a non-significant way (p= 0. 20). About the complicated response reaction time (CRT), the values were respectively 465. 29 ms± 59. 41 and 456. 13 ms± 52. 76 before and after the test (p= 0. 33). The error rate also decreased after the exercise in a non-significant way (p= 0. 45). No influence of the BMI was found on measures of SRT and CRT as well before and after effort.

Eighteen knees of 18 athletes (14 men and 4 women) with an average age of 21. 6 years (range 16 - 32 years) were assessed with a Cybex 6000 model isokinetic apparatus. The average interval between occurrence of the injury and assessment was 10. 2 months (range 2 - 48 months). There was an associated meniscal injury in eight of the knees. Athletes with any other kind of associated injury, limitation, or blockage of the movement of the joint, significant pain during the exam, or interval between injury and exam of less than two months were excluded from the study. The parameters studied were the peak torque-velocity and flexor-extensor relationships at the constant angular velocities of 60 °/sec and 240 °/sec. Previous warming-up was done by means of an <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> and adaptation with 3 submaximal repetitions. The contra-lateral side, which presented no injury, was used as control. Peak torque (PT) at the constant velocity of 60 °/sec was greater than that at 240 °/sec for knees with and without injuries. However, there was no significant difference between the injured and uninjured sides at 60 °/sec or at 240 °/sec. The average value for the flexor-extensor relationship at 60 °/sec on the injured was 60 % ((6), compared to 57 % ((10) on the contra-lateral side. At 240 °/sec, the average value was 75 % ((10) on the injured side, and 65 % ((12) on the contra-lateral side. In conclusion, despite the complete rupture of the ACL of one knee, the average values for the flexor-extensor relationship were similar on the injured and uninjured sides at the velocity of 60 °/sec. As the velocity increased, an increase in the values for the flexor-extensor relationship of the knee also occurred, indicating a tendency of the performance of the flexor muscle group to approach that of the extensor muscle group, and this tendency was more pronounced on the side of the injury...|$|E

The sample consisted of 40 female subjects (mean age 16 ± 1. 56 years) divided into 4 groups (aerobic training, anaerobic training, leisure activities, and control). Subjects had a body mass index of 95 % or more in relation to the 50 th percentile. The aerobic program consisted of three <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> sessions per week over a 3 -month period (12 weeks) and the activities were prescribed after determining the anaerobic ventilatory threshold (VO 2 threshold). Anaerobic training was based on the Wingate anaerobic power test. The leisure program consisted of a varied range of activities (games, exercises, etc.). A nutritionist interviewed the members of these two groups and the control group every week in order to adapt them to the nutritional guidelines proposed for the study. The study showed that all three programs (aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise and leisure activities) were effective in reducing body mass. However, we found a significant reduction when analyzing the depression scores only for aerobic exercise (18. 9 ± 9. 33 to 10. 6 ± 9. 56 or 43. 9 %) but no significant alterations for anaerobic exercise (11. 36 ± 5. 23 to 9. 63 ± 4. 78 or 15. 22 %) and leisure (17. 28 ± 7. 55 to 15. 07 ± 7. 54 or 12. 78 %), thus indicating that in principle this type of activity could be included to improve emotional well-being of obese adolescent girls.

Sixty-seven patients with advanced heart failure (mean [±SD]; age 51 ± 10 years, New York Heart Association functional classes III (58 %) and IV (18 %); mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0. 22 ± 0. 07) underwent simultaneous upright <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> cardiopulmonary exercise testing and first-pass rest/exercise radionuclide ventriculography. Mean peak oxygen consumption (Vo 2) was 11. 8 ± 4. 2 ml/kg per min, and mean peak age-and gender-adjusted percent predicted oxygen consumption (%Vo 2) was 38 ± 11. 9 %. Univariate predictors of overall survival included right ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 0. 35 at rest and ≥ 0. 35 at exercise and %Vo 2 ≥ 45 % (all p 0. 05 in left or right ventricular ejection fraction were not predictive of overall or event-free survival in any univariate or multivariate analysis. Conclusions. 1) Right ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 0. 35 at rest and exercise is a more potent predictor of survival in advanced heart failure than Vo 2 or %Vo 2; 2) %Vo 2 rather than Vo 2 predicts survival in advanced heart failure; 3) neither %Vo 2 nor Vo 2 predicts survival to the combined end point of death or admission for inotropic or mechanical support in patients with advanced heart failure...|$|R
40|$|Central and {{peripheral}} post-exercise haemodynamics {{were studied}} in 18 physically trained male subjects (10 hypertensive and eight normotensive) engaging in sports activities for 3 - 5 h/week. After a preliminary multistage <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> test {{to evaluate their}} maximal oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold, they underwent prolonged exercise at anaerobic threshold in the semi-supine position at 30 % grade until exhaustion (mean duration 60. 0 +/- 16. 7 min in the normotensive subjects and 61. 0 +/- 5. 7 min in the hypertensive subjects, not significant). During the recovery time, intra-arterial blood pressure, echocardiographic cardiac output and indium-gallium strain-gauge plethysmographic peripheral flow were measured, and total, forearm and leg peripheral resistances were calculated respectively from mean blood pressure/cardiac output and mean blood pressure/peripheral resistance. 2. Systolic blood pressure was decreased during the entire recovery period {{in comparison with the}} baseline values (- 8. 4 mmHg, - 43. 8 mmHg and - 39. 7 mmHg at the 1 st, 5 th and 10 th min in the hypertensive subjects, P = 0. 001, P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0001 respectively; - 18. 8, - 25. 5 and - 24. 1 mmHg in the normotensive subjects, not significant, P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 01, respectively) without any significant difference between the two groups, whereas the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant. Peripheral flow increased and peripheral resistance decreased in parallel in the forearm and the leg and showed similar trends in the hypertensive subjects and the normotensive subjects. The increase in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction and the decrease in total resistance were also similar in the two group...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} of smoking's negative impact and physical activity's positive impact on long-term health. However, evidences regarding the association between smoking and exercise activity and the independent effects of these factors on antioxidant defense are lacking. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the association between smoking and the intermittent anaerobic exercise on the physical fitness, oxidant and antioxidant status in Judo player. Methods: Twenty male Judo player student from Department of Physical Education Al-Azhar University were enrolled in the study. They were of 2 groups, Non-smokers (NS) and smokers (SM). Both groups were subjected to regular Judo training program (2 hours/day, 3 sessions/week for 12 weeks). Also, both groups were subjected to an effort test (running of submaximal intensity until exhaustion) and record of the maximum oxygen capacity (VO 2 max) using an <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle.</b> Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were recorded and blood samples were taken pre and post-effort test for determination of malondialdehyde (MDA),total antioxidant capacity (TAC), uric acid (Ua) and lactate (La) in the plasma. Also the time to exhaustion was recorded during the effort test. These measures were performed pre and post the training program. Results: At rest the pre-program data of SM showed significantly higher H. R., and plasma MDA,and significantly lower TAC with tendency to increase in MBP and La levels, and decrease in VO 2 max, and Ua levels compared to NS. Before program and in response to acute exercise SM showed significantly higher H. R, MDA and La levels with significantly lower TAC, Ua and time to exhaustion compared to NS. On the other hand, after the program and in response to acute exercise, SM showed more pronounced significantly higher HR, MBP, MDA and La with significantly lower VO 2 max, time to exhaustion and TAC with insignificant changes in the Ua compared to the NS that showed significant increase in the Ua levels with insignificant changes in the MDA, TAC and the La levels in response to acute exercise. In response to the training program, SM showed significantly higher HR, MBP, MDA and La levels, with significantly lower VO 2 max, time to exhaustion, and TAC, and insignificant changes in the Ua levels compared to NS. Conclusion: We conclude that cigarette smoking has a significant detrimental effects on cardiovascular fitness, physical endurance, TAC and lipid peroxidation that all worsened by the intermittent anaerobic exercise. On the contrary, this type of training is beneficial in nonsmokers. Also we demonstrated that smoking prevent the beneficial effects of exercise, so smoking should be avoided in Judo players. Smokers should be given strong encouragement to stop smoking and to improve physical fitness...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the flexor-extensor group of muscles of the knee in young athletes {{diagnosed}} with a total rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Eighteen knees of 18 athletes (14 men and 4 women) with an average age of 21. 6 years (range 16 - 32 years) were assessed with a Cybex 6000 model isokinetic apparatus. The average interval between occurrence of the injury and assessment was 10. 2 months (range 2 - 48 months). There was an associated meniscal injury in eight of the knees. Athletes with any other kind of associated injury, limitation, or blockage of the movement of the joint, significant pain during the exam, or interval between injury and exam of less than two months were excluded from the study. The parameters studied were the peak torque-velocity and flexor-extensor relationships at the constant angular velocities of 60 °/sec and 240 °/sec. Previous warming-up was done by means of an <b>ergometric</b> <b>bicycle</b> and adaptation with 3 submaximal repetitions. The contra-lateral side, which presented no injury, was used as control. Peak torque (PT) at the constant velocity of 60 °/sec was greater than that at 240 °/sec for knees with and without injuries. However, there was no significant difference between the injured and uninjured sides at 60 °/sec or at 240 °/sec. The average value for the flexor-extensor relationship at 60 °/sec on the injured was 60 % ((6), compared to 57 % ((10) on the contra-lateral side. At 240 °/sec, the average value was 75 % ((10) on the injured side, and 65 % ((12) on the contra-lateral side. In conclusion, despite the complete rupture of the ACL of one knee, the average values for the flexor-extensor relationship were similar on the injured and uninjured sides at the velocity of 60 °/sec. As the velocity increased, an increase in the values for the flexor-extensor relationship of the knee also occurred, indicating a tendency of the performance of the flexor muscle group to approach that of the extensor muscle group, and this tendency was more pronounced on the side of the injury. O objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar o grupo muscular flexo-extensor do joelho de esportistas jovens que tiveram diagnóstico de ruptura completa do ligamento cruzado anterior (LCA). Dezoito joelhos de 18 atletas (14 homens e 4 mulheres) com idade média de 21, 6 anos (16 - 32) foram avaliados com aparelho isocinético modelo Cybex 6000. O intervalo médio entre a lesão e a avaliação foi de 10, 2 meses (2 - 48). Houve lesão meniscal associada em oito joelhos. Demais atletas com outro tipo de lesão associada, limitação ou bloqueio da amplitude articular, dor importante durante o exame e tempo de lesão com menos de dois meses foram excluídos do estudo. O parâmetro estudado foi o pico de torque (PT) e a relação flexo-extensora do PT nas velocidades angulares constantes de 60 º/seg e 240 º/seg. Foi realizado um aquecimento prévio com bicicleta ergométrica e adaptação com três repetições submáximas. O lado contra-lateral, que não apresentava lesão, foi usado como controle. O PT na velocidade constante de 60 °/seg foi maior do que na velocidade de 240 °/seg, seja nos joelhos com ou sem lesão. Não houve diferença significante entre o lado com e sem lesão, tanto a 60 °/seg como a 240 °/seg. O valor médio da relação flexo-extensora do PT na velocidade de 60 º/seg no lado com lesão foi de 60 % (± 6) e no lado contra-lateral 57 % (± 10). A 240 º/seg no lado com lesão foi de 75 % (± 10) e no contra-lateral foi de 65 % (± 12). Como conclusões observou-se que os valores do equilíbrio flexo-extensor foram semelhantes na velocidade de 60 º/seg, apesar da ruptura completa do LCA. À medida que ocorreu aumento da velocidade, ocorreu também um aumento da relação flexo-extensora do joelho, indicando leve tendência do grupo muscular flexor se aproximar do extensor, mais pronunciada no lado com lesão...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between the extent of myocardial necrosis and the presence of myocardium at risk in myocardial infarction without Q waves (NQMI) we studied by echocardiography the prevalence of jeopardized myocardium in a group of NQMI stratified on the basis of left ventricular wall motion (akinesis, hypokinesis, normal kinesis). We have studied 60 consecutive patients with non-Q myocardial infarction. Patients were examined by 2 D echo at rest (V-VI day from the acute episode) and during symptoms limited <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> test (ExT) (XX-XXX day). Regional left ventricular wall motion was evaluated as normal or asynergic (severe hypokinetic, akinetic) and the ExT was considered positive in case of new asynergic areas or ECG criteria. 2 D echo at rest was technically satisfactory in 56 patients, 19 showed almost an akinetic segment (Aci) 17 had hypokinetic areas (Ipo) and 20 had normal left ventricle kinesis (Norc). Wall motion abnormalities were localized more frequently in the apex and lateral areas. During exercise 2 D echo was performed in 46 patients (82 %) with 23 positive tests (50 %). Stratifying the population on the basis of left ventricle wall motion we observed a major number of positive tests in the group of patients with normal wall motion in comparison with those with asynergic areas at rest (Norc 66. 6 %, Ipo 35. 7 %, Aci 42. 6 % p less than 0. 05 Nore vs Ipo and Nore vs Aci) despite the same CAD extension. These data show the heterogeneity of the NQMI that likely includes patients with transmural (asynergy group) and subendocardial MI (normal kinesis group), the latter with a higher degree of myocardium at risk...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of adenosine receptor blockade by aminophylline on cardiac functional reserve in patients with syndrome X. Background. Aminophylline may have a potentially antiischemic effect through the inhibition of adenosine and, thus, the coronary steal phenomenon in patients with syndrome X. Methods. A single-blind, placebo-controlled study of an intravenous infusion of aminophylline (6 mg/kg body weight over 15 min) or placebo (20 ml of saline solution over 15 min) was performed during continuous radionuclide monitoring of left ventricular ejection fraction in 12 patients performing supine <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> exercise. Results. Aminophylline increased exercise time (aminophylline 400 s vs. placebo 355 s, p < 0. 01), decreased degree of ST segment depression (aminophylline 1. 6 mm vs. placebo 2. 4 mm, p < 0. 01) and either abolished (seven patients) or diminished (five patients) chest pain during exercise. Aminophylline also increased left ventricular ejection fraction at rest (aminophylline 66. 5 % vs. placebo 62. 3 %, p < 0. 05) but did not improve its deterioration at peak exercise (aminophylline 60. 1 % vs. placebo 56. 6 %, p = NS) or shorten the abnormally prolonged interval {{between the end of}} exercise and the overshoot (aminophylline 115 s vs. placebo 130 s, p = NS). Conclusions. Aminophylline infusion increases ischemic threshold and prolongs exercise duration in patients with syndrome X. It is hypothesized that aminophylline acts by inhibiting the coronary steal phenomenon through adenosine receptor blockade. It does not improve the deterioration in left ventricular function at peak exercise or the delayed response in ejection fraction in the recovery period. presumably because the beneficial effects of aminophylline s at result from the redistribution of coronary blood flow are limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral {{doses of the}} beta 1 -selective {{adrenoceptor}} antagonist atenolol (50 mg), the non-selective antagonist propranolol (40 mg) and placebo was investigated during exercise in a crossover comparison in six healthy but untrained subjects. Descriptors of ventilation, respiratory gas exchange, and arterialized blood lactate and glucose were obtained during steady state <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> exercise at 20 % and 60 % of the subjects' previously determined maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). At these work intensities, the previously reported increase of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade {{was found to be}} trivial (placebo = 0. 96 +/- 0. 03 s. e. mean; propranolol = 0. 97 +/- 0. 01; atenolol = 0. 97 +/- 0. 04; 60 % VO 2 max, 10 min exercise) and only present during the early minutes of effort. Oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production did not differ between treatments. Both drugs produced highly significant falls in peak expiratory flow (PEF) rates and tidal volume (VT) which were compensated by an increase in respiratory rate. PEF, 60 % VO 2 max: placebo = 3. 8 +/- 0. 3 l/s; propranolol 3. 6 +/- 0. 3 l/s (P less than 0. 03); atenolol 3. 1 +/- 0. 3 l/s (P less than 0. 01). VT, 60 % VO 2 max: placebo 2. 0 +/- 0. 1 l; propranolol 1. 8 +/- 0. 21 (P less than 0. 05); atenolol 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 1 (P less than 0. 01). Arterialized lactate was significantly elevated during work at 20 % and 60 % VO 2 max, but rose progressively at the 60 % VO 2 max load. Ventilation, oxygen uptake and ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide also rose progressively at this workload. Ventilatory equivalent for oxygen showed no significant rise.

40|$|Aim of this multicenter {{randomized}} {{study was}} to investigate whether longterm physical training would influence left ventricular remodeling and function in patients (pts) with systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI). Forty-three consecutive pts (51 ± 8 years) with≤ 0 : 40 % ejection fraction (EF) and no contraindications to exercise, in I-II NYHA Class, were studied 3 - 5 weeks after a first Q-wave MI and 6 months later by 2 D-ECHO at rest and upright symptom-limited <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> test. After the initial study, pts were randomly allocated to a 6 -month exercise training program (T,n 22) or control (C,n 21). A computerized system was used to derive echocardiographic variables of ventricular size, function and topography. At entry, work capacity (WC). end-diastolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV) volumes, EF, extent of wall motion abnormalities (%WMA) and regional dilatation (%RD) were similar in the two groups. After 6 months, a significant increase in WC was observed only in T (from 4, 527 ± 1, 107 to 5, 529 ± 1, 828 Kp-m, p< 0. 01) and not in C (from 4, 371 ± 1, 143 to 4, 268 ± 1, 199 Kp-m, NS), whereas LV volumes and %RD increased in C (EDV: from 86 ± 24 to 95 ± 29 ml/m 2, p < 0. 01; ESV: from 58 ± 21 to 66 ± 26 ml/m 2, p< 0. 01; %RD: from 47 ± 18 to 57 ± 22, p< 0. 01) but not in T (EDV: from 84 ± 21 to 85 ± 22 ml/m 2, NS; ESV: from 56 ± 17 to 54 ± 19 ml/m 2, NS; %RD: from 43 ± 18 to 45 ± 26, NS). Conversely, %WMA decreased and EF improved in T (%WMA: from 48 ± 8 to 43 ± 10, P< 0. 01; EF: from 34 ± 5 to 38 ± 8 %, p< 0. 01), but not in C (%WMA: from 47 ± 9 to 48 ± 12, NS; EF: from 33 ± 5 to 32 ± 7 %, NS). Thus, from these preliminary data it appears that in postinfarction pts with poor left ventricular function long-term exercise training may attenuate the unfavorable remodeling response and even improve both global and regional function over time...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} five year {{prognostic}} significance of transient myocardial ischaemia on ambulatory monitoring after a first acute myocardial infarction, and {{to compare the}} diagnostic and long term prognostic value of ambulatory ST segment monitoring, maximal exercise testing, and echocardiography in patients with documented ischaemic heart disease. DESIGN [...] Prospective study. SETTING [...] Cardiology department of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] 123 consecutive men aged under 70 {{who were able to}} perform predischarge maximal exercise testing. INTERVENTIONS [...] Echocardiography two days before discharge (left ventricular ejection fraction), maximal <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> testing one day before discharge (ST segment depression, angina, blood pressure, heart rate), and ambulatory ST segment monitoring (transient myocardial ischaemia) started at hospital discharge a mean of 11 (SD 5) days after infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Relation of ambulatory ST segment depression, exercise test variables, and left ventricular ejection fraction to subsequent objective (cardiac death or myocardial infarction) or subjective (need for coronary revascularisation) events. RESULTS [...] 23 of the 123 patients had episodes of transient ST segment depression, of which 98 % were silent. Over a mean of 5 (range 4 to 6) years of follow up, patients with ambulatory ischaemia were no more likely to have objective end points than patients without ischaemic episodes. If, however, subjective events were included an association between transient ST segment depression and an adverse long term outcome was found (Kaplan-Meier analysis; P = 0. 004). The presence of exercise induced angina identified a similar proportion of patients with a poor prognosis (Kaplan-Meier analysis; P < 0. 004). Both exertional angina and ambulatory ST segment depression had high specificity but poor sensitivity. The presence of exercise induced ST segment depression was of no value in predicting combined cardiac events. Indeed, patients without exertional ST segment depression were at increased risk of future objective end points (Kaplan-Meier analysis; P < 0. 0045). These findings may be explained in part by a higher prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction in patients without ischaemic changes in the exercise electrocardiogram (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION [...] There seem to be limited reasons to perform ambulatory ST segment monitoring in survivors of a first myocardial infarction who can perform exercise tests before discharge. Patients at high risk of future myocardial infarction or death from cardiac causes are not identified. Ambulatory monitoring and exertional angina distinguish a small subset of patients who will develop severe angina pectoris demanding coronary revascularisation during follow up. Patients without exercise induced ST segment depression comprise a high risk subgroup in terms of subsequent objective end points. The role of ambulatory ST segment monitoring performed in unselected patients immediately after infarction when risk is maximal remains to be clarified...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo do presente estudo foi verificar o efeito da abstinência do fumo nas respostas cardiovasculares ao exercício físico progressivo submáximo em mulheres sedentárias fumantes. MÉTODOS: A pressão {{arterial}} sistólica (PAS) e diastólica (PAD) e a freqüência cardíaca (FC) foram medidas de forma não invasiva em mulheres jovens não fumantes (MNF, n = 7) e fumantes (MF, n = 7), sem e com abstinência do fumo por 24 horas, em repouso, durante a realização do teste submáximo em bicicleta ergométrica e na recuperação. RESULTADOS: Em repouso, a PAD e a FC foram maiores nas MF (76 ± 1 mmHg e 86 ± 5 bpm) quando comparadas com as MNF (68 ± 2 mmHg e 72 ± 2 bpm). Após 24 horas sem o tabaco essas medidas foram normalizadas. Durante o exercício, a PAS e a FC aumentaram nos grupos estudados. A PAD foi maior nas MF (~ 15 %) em relação às MNF em todos os estágios do exercício. Na situação de abstinência, a PAD aumentou somente no último estágio de exercício. Na recuperação tanto a PAD quanto a FC foram maiores nas MF, na situação basal e com abstinência de 24 h, quando comparadas as MNF. CONCLUSÃO: Estes resultados demonstram que mulheres jovens fumantes apresentam prejuízo em parâmetros hemodinâmicos em repouso e em resposta ao exercício submáximo, os quais, podem ser em parte revertidos pela abstinência em curto prazo do uso do tabaco. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of}} the present study was to verify the effect of tobacco smoking abstinence on cardiovascular responses to progressive submaximal physical exercise in sedentary female smokers. METHODS: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were non-invasively measured in young non-smoking women (NSW, n = 7) and smoking women (SW, n = 7), with and without tobacco abstinence for 24 hours, at rest, during the accomplishment of a submaximal <b>bicycle</b> <b>ergometric</b> test and recovery period. RESULTS: At rest, DBP and HR were higher in the SW group (76 ± 1 mmHg and 86 ± 5 bpm) when compared to the NSW group (68 ± 2 mmHg and 72 ± 2 bpm). After 24 hours of no tobacco use, the groups presented similar values. During exercise, SBP and HR increased in the studied groups. DBP was higher in the SW group (~ 15 %) in relation to the NSW group in all periods of exercise training. In the abstinence period, DBP only increased in the last load of exercise. During recovery period, in basal condition and 24 h-abstinence, both DBP and HR were higher in the SW group when compared to the NSW group. CONCLUSION: These results show that young female smokers present harmful consequences in hemodynamic parameters at rest and in response to submaximal exercise. These findings can be partly reverted by short-term abstinence from tobacco use...|$|R
