To this <b>end,</b> <b>standard</b> quantum error correction employs parallel projective measurements of individual particles, which makes the system extremely complicated.

We calculate an error threshold, below which quantum information is protected, without assuming selective addressing, projective measurements, nor instantaneous classical processing. All physical operations are local and translationally invariant, and no parallel projective measurement is required, which implies high scalability. Furthermore, since the engineered dissipative dynamics we utilized has been well studied in quantum simulation, the proposed scheme can be a promising route progressing from quantum simulation to fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

However, information {{on the relationship between}} phenology and Ascochyta response genes, and their possible interaction with biomass and grain yield, is missing. Accordingly, the aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the associations between the above factors and biomass and grain yield in chickpea. To that <b>end,</b> <b>standard</b> Israeli cultivars and advanced generation bulked progeny from the cv. Hadas × ICC 5810 cross were used. Hadas is a late-flowering, high-yielding Israeli kabuli (0. 45 g/seed) cultivar with moderate field resistance to Ascochyta blight, whereas ICC 5810 is a day-neutral desi (0. 15 g/seed) genotype with a strong temperature response, from India. Higher yields were observed among the late-flowering bulks of the Hadas × ICC 5810 progeny. No relationship between the Ascochyta response and biomass and grain yield was observed. No interaction between the phenology and Ascochyta response grouping on biomass and grain yield was observed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining Ascochyta resistance with earlier flowering and its potential to improve chickpea adaptation to dryland systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of shear stress {{developed as a}} fluid moves around a solid body is difficult to measure. Stresses at the fluid-solid interface are very small {{and the nature of}} the fluid flow is easily disturbed by introducing sensor components to the interface. To address these challenges, an array of direct and indirect techniques have been investigated with various advantages and challenges. Hot wire sensors and other indirect sensors all protrude significantly into the fluid flow. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, although facilitating very accurate measurements, are not durable, are prone to contamination, and are difficult to implement into existing model geometries. One promising approach is the use of engineered surfaces that interact with fluid flow in a detectable manner.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between wages and (un) employment {{is probably one}} of the most widely investigated issues in empirical economics. Whereas in the early post-war period, the focus was on macroeconomic Phillips-curve-type relationships from wage or price inflation to unemployment, current research is mainly concerned with wage responses to unemployment (the wage curve) or the wage and (un) employment structure and relies strongly on individual data. The observation of rising unemployment in Europe (especially for the unskilled) and of increasing wage inequality in the United States has led to the popular belief that these phenomena are ‘two sides of the same coin ’ (Krugman), namely a fall in the relative demand for unskilled labour. This hypothesis maintains that rigid wages in Europe prevented the relative fall in unskilled wages observed in the United States, causing quantity adjustments in the form of higher unemployment. This paper presents a new and simple approach to identify labour markets with wage rigidities empirically by a set of individual cross-section data. The basis for the proposed methodology is the observation of wage and unemployment dynamics associated with labour market characteristics. To this <b>end,</b> <b>standard</b> wage and unemployment regressions are estimated on individual data.

To this <b>end,</b> <b>standard</b> consumption equations are estimated and then compared, in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability, with corresponding models which differ from them {{only because of the}} presence of the confidence indicator. Unlike mainstream literature, the present work focuses on the relationships between subjective and objective information at a less aggregate level. In particular, the overall sentiment index is divided into four sub-indices related to the opinion about the i) current, ii) future, iii) general, and iv) personal situation. In turn, the total private consumption is divided in five items. The idea behind is to check if one attitudinal measure is more or less informative than another, and if some outlay is more or less “sentiment sensitive” than another. It is shown that the qualitative information obtained from household surveys improves both the goodness- of-fit of consumption equations and their forecasting performances. It is noteworthy that these improvements are all the more evident when working on disaggregated data, i. e., linking a particular kind of consumption to a particular sub index. For instance, perceptions about the future help to explain consumption for services more than disbursement for non durable goods. Consumer sentiment; Surveys; Consumption; Time series...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of its}} {{training}} activities, SupAgro – Institut des Régions Chaudes (IRC), {{an agricultural}} engineering school in Montpellier, has introduced an applied training session in metrology for its students. This was undertaken by the CIRAD metrology platform {{in partnership with the}} agrifood technology platform of the Qualisud Joint Research Unit. The session comprises two hour workshops during which students can apply the basic notions required for metrological monitoring of the quantities “temperature” and “weight”. To that <b>end,</b> <b>standard</b> weights, a temperature calibration device comprising a thermostatically controlled calibration oil bath (uncertainty at k = 2 of 0. 14 °C) and a standard temperature probe with an accuracy of ± 0. 01 °C were made available to the technology platform by the CIRAD metrology platform. During practical work, these COFRAC calibrated instruments are used to check balances and, in particular, make students {{aware of the importance of}} parameters that might influence the temperature measurement of a thermostatically controlled bath (homogeneity, resolution and accuracy of the thermometers, measurement repeatability, etc.). To that end, the Qualisud team specifically adapted a water bath so as to be able to position several temperature probes at different places in the bath. Students have to acquire an approach that needs to take into account a particular measuring context. The teaching scenario of the training session is structured around these metrological checks proposed directly to the students. The training session takes place each year with 2 nd year students on the SAADS 2 /IAAS course “Sustainable Agriculture and Agrifood Systems in the South” at SupAgro in Montpellier.

40|$|It is {{the focus}} of this project to explore the {{possibility}} of achieving Radio Fre¬quency (RF) micro-devices on flexible polymer substrates. To this <b>end</b> <b>standard</b> MEMS fabrication methods have been tailored to allow the integration of func¬tional materials and device patterning for production of RF MEMS devices with flexible organic substrates. Material quality, device yield, performance and re-liability are critical aspects of our study. The project encompasses the use of a direct integration method for the creation of Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBARs) on Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrates. An FBAR is a passive component used for resonance and filtering purposes. Its production on organic substrates would lead to a number of ad-vantages including: overall cost savings, size reduction and ability of the device to be directly integrated on the printed circuit board (PCB) front-end with the other essential components (i. e. antenna) without the use of wiring and inter-connections. New fabrication process flows have been developed to allow the creation of FBAR microwave devices on LCP. First of all pre-processing of the polymer substrate is carried out to make it rigid and smooth. Substrate smoothness and stiffness are necessary in order to obtain functioning devices and for the substrate to comply to the standard fabrication methods. Rigidity is achieved through a backing method whereby silicon or glass are attached to LCP with an intermediate adhesive layer. The best way to achieve smoothness was found to be Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP). Standard fabrication techniques were then employed to deposit the metal and piezoelectric material and pattern them. Both bulk and surface micromachining were used and, in some cases, tailored to suit the new substrates (LCP) tolerance limits (such as temperature and flexibility). Zinc Oxide (ZnO) piezoelectric is the preferred functional material and it is chosen due to its relatively low deposition temperature re¬quirements (below 300 C) and its high frequency characteristics. The creation of a front-to-back processed FBAR on LCP is successfully carried out at relatively low temperatures since the Zinc oxide (ZnO) functional mate¬rial is proven to yield good crystallinity at a deposition temperature of 100 C and also because micromachining temperatures do not generally exceed 115 C. The final device is characterized through RF measurements, compared with sim¬ulations and standard FBARs and the polymer/ceramic integration reliability for device creation is briefly addressed. In conclusion FBARs are successfully created on LCP with only minor compli¬cations related to LCP surface roughness and RIE etch of the polymer. The project lays promising prospects for RF MEMS devices on compliant organic substrates. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
