50|$|Released in 2011, the MK25 {{has been}} advertised by SIG as being {{identical}} to firearm {{carried by the}} U.S. Navy SEALs. Features that help identify it amongst other P226 variants include the silver anchor and UID <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> {{on the left side}} of the pistol, as well as a mil-spec picatinny rail. Although cosmetically similar to the Navy model, the MK25 features an anti-corrosion coating applied to all external and internal surfaces, as well as SIGLITE Night Sights.|$|E
50|$|For {{items that}} are {{under the control of}} the Department of Defense and subject for marking, there are many {{specifications}} that must be met for a proper mark. These requirements state that all marking must be applied to a metal or stiff plastic identification plate, identification band, identification tag, or <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> that is securely fastened to the item. Additionally, the marking may even be applied directly to the surface of the item itself - provided of course it can still meet the requirements described below.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{rooms on the}} left; the digger team, the {{withdrawal}} room and the naval room. Digger team room is the room of the museum history. There are frequent references to other wars also. Withdrawal room is the room of Allies withdrawal. In this room weapons and various tools the Allies left during the evacuation from the peninsula are exhibited. They are deliberatively cracked by the Allies. These include uniforms, canned foods, flasks etc [...] The naval room is the room of the Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign preceding the Gallipoli campaign on 18 March 1915. Among the exhibits, Cartridge of French ship Bouvet (a battle ship sunk during the operations) and a rare <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> of a downed French airplane are notable.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle {{registration}} {{plates of}} Estonia {{are divided into}} 18 categories, {{the most common of}} these (A1) is composed of three numbers and three letters (e.g. 123 ABC). Most registration plate types have black letters on a white background, and the plates are the same size and length as other European plates (520 × 113 mm). Previously the first of the three letters indicated the region of Estonia in which the car was registered; however, as of 2013, this is no longer the case. The third digit from the numbers indicated states when the car is due an inspection. It can be inspected up to 2 months after that digit. The registration plates are printed on an aluminium sheet with minimum thickness of 1 mm and must fulfil the requirements of ISO 7591:1982. All plates are issued with the blue European Union <b>identification</b> <b>label,</b> except types A9 and B2.|$|E

In this paper we propose a system for capturing and processing car <b>identification</b> <b>labels.</b> The system captures the required images for the registration process using a CCD camera with an appropriate mount. Images are analyzed and stored by the system, generating a report, where all the captured visual information is included. The information is further stored in a way, that allows the retrieval of each report. Results and discussion about the system are presented...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{people who suffer from}} muscular {{dystrophy}} or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A webcam captures images of the user’s head, and the computer then processes these images to calculate and transform the swinging direction and distance of the user’s head into the position of the mouse cursor and into the action of clicking the mouse. To accurately and quickly recognize these features, this article used a round sticker with a diameter of 1 [*]cm as an <b>identification</b> <b>label,</b> which is stuck on the user’s forehead. After the webcam captures the images, the program can recognize the positions of the <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> and move the mouse cursor. Through Windows API, this article determined the user’s intention and action of clicking the mouse {{on the basis of a}} series of movements to control the mouse cursor. As confirmed by the experimental results, the proposed assisted computer entry device for muscular atrophy patients is applicable and gives good results for the e-book reading program, use of the web browser, and the execution of the application software and mini-games developed by this system structure...|$|E

The novelty of this system consists in the integration of fingerprint recognition with public cryptography to yield an authentication system whose security is significantly higher than other authentication schemes currently in use.

We investigated {{the role played by}} the assembly liquid, by the size and the weight of assembling dies and by their initial offsets in the self-alignment performance. It was shown that there is a definite range of initial offsets allowing dies to align with high accuracy and within approximately the same time window, irrespective of their initial offset...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the growing {{complexity}} and miniaturization of innovative products systems integration {{is becoming more and more}} important for scientific and technical development. The micro and nano system technologies as well as electronics are playing a key role in today’s product development and industrial progress. They enable the integration of mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical, biological and other functions into a very small space with dimensions ranging from sub micrometers up to some millimeters. This paper presents three examples of MEMS sensors developed at Fraunhofer ENAS and Chemnitz University of Technology and the approaches for their integration into smart systems. The first one is an active radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> for the monitoring of shock, inclination and temperature during transportation processes. A MEMS spectrometer and gyroscopes will be demonstrated. Special emphasis is given to MEMS /nanointegration...|$|E
40|$|The article {{seeks to}} {{describe}} {{the impact of a}} cultural mega-event on a specific city context in post-communist Romania. Our case-study of Sibiu – European Capital of Culture 2007 underlines the importance of cultural events for the identity-building process in the new post-communist settings. On one hand, the cultural event in Sibiu managed to enhance the city’s image and to promote Romania worldwide by stressing on the multicultural identity of the city, the ethnic cooperation and trust in a region still marked by ethnic conflict and hatred. On the other hand, Sibiu’s multiculturalism and Europeanization might become a landmark for Romania and transform into an actual brand, which could finally replace ‘Dracula’ as the main <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> for Romania. Instead of promoting a supernatural, remote, sinister, and even backward Transylvania, the new brand could more properly speak about modern, tolerant and peaceful Romania...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze mass spectra of {{scorpions}} belonging to the genus Parabuthus (Pocock 1890) by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and to construct a species-specific venom code for species identification. The venom compositions of sixteen Parabuthus species, occurring in southern Africa, were characterized using representative peaks in the molecular mass range of 6400 - 8400 Da. This mass range is characteristic for the typical long-chain neurotoxins influencing sodium channels. Only a few of these peptides have been sequenced up to now. The impetus for development of these species-specific profiles was the observation of unique, highly reproducible mass spectral peaks within a specific species. An <b>identification</b> <b>label</b> for all the different species could be found using a minimum number of peaks. MALDI-TOFMS is therefore proposed as a complementary method to morphological and behavioural characteristics for species and ultimately subspecies discrimination. status: publishe...|$|E
