The journal offered child-rearing advice and assessments of contemporary educational theories, and Trimmer even proffered her own <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> after evaluating the major works of the day.|$|E
5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing <b>educational</b> <b>theory,</b> Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs.

25|$|During 1768–1774, no {{progress}} was made in setting up a national school system. Catherine continued to investigate <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> and practice of other countries. She made many educational reforms {{despite the lack of}} a national school system. The remodelling of the Cadet Corps 1766 initiated many educational reforms. It then began to take children from a very young age and educate them until the age of 21. The curriculum was broadened from the professional military curriculum to include the sciences, philosophy, ethics, history, and international law. This policy in the Cadet Corps influenced the teaching in the Naval Cadet Corps and in the Engineering and Artillery Schools. After the war and the defeat of Pugachev, Catherine laid the obligation to establish schools at the guberniya—a provincial subdivision of the Russian empire ruled by a governor—on the Boards of Social Welfare set up with the participation of elected representatives from the three free estates.|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} the Friedrichstadt Teacher College, Maeser {{was exposed to}} Pestalozzian <b>educational</b> <b>theory,</b> which greatly influenced his educational philosophy. Pestalozzian <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> recognizes the potential of each individual. Pestalozzi encouraged teachers to treat their students with kindness and respect, and to show love to their students, instead of evoking fear. Pestalozzi was also in favor of universal education and opposed separately educating different social classes. Maeser adopted many of his ideas. He supported the education of women. Maeser believed that students {{should be allowed to}} express themselves freely and choose their own careers. His lectures tried to engage students and help them understand concepts through their own experiences. He also included many object lessons to coach students to observe their surroundings and make connections. Maeser admired Prestalozzian teachers Adolph Diesterweg and Friedrich Fröbel Maeser also agreed that [...] "education should be balanced head, heart and hand." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Rousseau's [...] (1762), Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education {{was one of}} the {{foundational}} eighteenth-century texts on <b>educational</b> <b>theory.</b> In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that Some Thoughts Concerning Education vies with the Essay Concerning Human Understanding for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, believed this as well; Leibniz argued that Some Thoughts superseded even the Essay in its impact on European society.|$|E
500|$|Harris and Graeme-Evans based {{the series}} around an {{underlying}} educational structure, primarily using Howard Gardner's Theory of multiple intelligences. It is recognised that each child learns {{in a different}} way, and each cast member has a specific segment within the show which targets a different aspect of learning, ranging from logical-mathematical thinking to a focus on linguistic skills, to cater to a child's individual learning approach. Harris observed that most viewers had a favourite cast member, believing that children generally [...] "respond more favourably to the presenter who models the learning style they prefer". The use of multiple segments is also designed to hold the attention span of young children. The skills of pre-numeracy and pre-literacy are a focus of the <b>educational</b> <b>theory,</b> to prepare children for learning at school, while also encouraging self-confidence and expression. According to the show's website, Hi-5 also uses Piaget's theory of cognitive development, providing a learning experience that promotes individual growth.|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} {{of learning and}} memory that has developed from studies in modern cognitive psychology, including those studies that have incorporated models of human connectivity and environmental interaction, has influenced <b>educational</b> <b>theories</b> and practices. Some educational researchers {{have suggested that the}} {{understanding of}} learning and memory that has developed in recent years from studies in integrative biology, with its focus on empirical science, has had much lessinfluence. Insights on learning and memory obtained from combined studies in cognitive psychology and integrative biology, however, have indicated that environmental interaction and information processing are key components of the understanding of learning and memory. This paper outlines some of the <b>educational</b> <b>theories</b> that have been developed from studies in modern cognitive psychology andintegrative biology, with a focus on <b>educational</b> <b>theories</b> that have incorporated concepts related to environmental connectivity and information processing, for example, through the conceptualisation of a long-term memory that is limited by attention and working memory processes.

500|$|John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education at the {{beginning}} of a tradition of <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> which they label [...] "environmentalism". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac and Claude Adrien Helvétius eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the [...] "object lesson." [...] These lessons focused pupils' attention on a particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners [...] "if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Edgeworth {{observed}} on his wife's death that being {{familiar with the}} experimental method in science, {{she was surprised to}} find that <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> was based on very little empirical evidence, and set out to apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778–1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in [...] "Practical Education". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.|$|E

Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary <b>educational</b> <b>theory</b> placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, [...] "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational [...] "companions" [...] of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: [...] "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses.
