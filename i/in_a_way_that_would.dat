5|$|Bethesda Softworks, the {{developer}} of Morrowind, offers the ability change the game via plugins (often {{referred to as}} modifications, or mods for short) using The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which comes with the PC version of the game. The Construction Set, {{and a variety of}} third-party mod-making tools, allows the modder to create and edit different objects, places, characters, dialogues, races, birthsigns, abilities, and skills. Characters can be made as strong or as fast as the user wants, and allows the player to experience the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not normally be possible within the game's mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The Country Sunrise News {{stated that}} the drama has a fast pace. Mallory Clarkson of the London Community News {{reported}} that, while She Has a Name is an emotional play, there are lighter moments where audience members can laugh. Similarly, Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate asserted that the play's sporadic humorous points maintain the audience's engagement with the story so they do not become numb to the play's emotional pulls. Kooman stated {{that he tried to}} write the play <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> shock audiences without disturbing them {{to the point that they}} would not recommend it to friends.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an {{artificial}} leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> help others find courage.|$|E

5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{initially}} {{imagined that}} the film would center around a clone of the character Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

25|$|The {{credibility}} of the sources that ascribe these doctrines to Plato is controversial.
