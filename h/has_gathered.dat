5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{game and}} its official expansion have been praised {{as one of}} the benchmark real-time strategy games of its time. The series <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> a solid following around the world, particularly in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches. By June 2007, StarCraft and Brood War had sold nearly 10million copies combined. In addition, the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006, and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Skinner {{visits the}} Lone Gunmen, who are {{monitoring}} UFO {{activity in the}} United States {{in the hopes of}} tracking down Mulder. Skinner later finds out that someone has used Mulder's FBI pass {{to gain access to the}} X-Files, and that the Bureau task force considers him the main suspect. Meanwhile, Doggett <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> enough evidence to track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under his door.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} been very {{successful}} despite its relatively limited amount of media, and <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> a significant fan base. However, the franchise did not gain more widespread recognition until after the 1993 release of LucasArts' Sam & Max Hit the Road, which cultivated interest in Purcell's original comics. Sam & Max Hit the Road is regarded as an exceptional adventure game and an iconic classic of computer gaming in the 1990s. Subsequent video games and the television series have also fared well with both critics and fans; critics consider the episodic video games {{to be the first}} successful application of the episodic distribution model.|$|E
5|$|As Crash gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex Vortex built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves the Cortex Vortex drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys the Cortex Vortex, breaking the space station apart.|$|E

5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: if she <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> various {{awards and}} {{nominations}} following its release, with most nominations recognising the film {{itself and the}} cast's acting performances, particularly those of Michelle Williams and Kenneth Branagh (who plays Laurence Olivier). Both actors received nominations at the 84th Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. The actors also received nominations from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, while the film was nominated for Best Picture at the African-American Film Critics Association. My Week with Marilyn received four nominations from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, with two nominations coming in the Best Costume Design and Best Makeup categories. The British Academy Film Awards handed the film seven nominations, including Best British Film, Best Actress for Williams, Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Judi Dench, Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hair. The cast received the Capri Ensemble Cast Award from the Capri, Hollywood International Film Festival in January 2012.|$|E

5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience <b>has</b> <b>gathered</b> at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material <b>has</b> <b>gathered,</b> the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
