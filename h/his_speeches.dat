5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|At Thap Kaew, ML Pin also {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} the Sound Library, a remotely accessible on-demand audio collection. King Bhumibol Adulyadej donated recordings of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> to the library, and later remote access via radio from Bangkok was developed, but the library was not maintained after ML Pin's presidency ended and thus fell into disuse.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, German anti-Semitic theorist Alfred Rosenberg in {{his primary}} {{contribution}} to Nazi theory on Zionism, Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus ("Zionism, the Enemy of the State"), accused German Zionists {{of working for}} a German defeat and supporting Britain and {{the implementation of the}} Balfour Declaration, in a version of the stab-in-the-back myth. Adolf Hitler took a similar approach in some of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> from 1920 onwards.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Matica {{hrvatska}} {{published his}} book, The Croatian People and Their Lands (Narod i zemlja Hrvata), in which Lorković {{focused on the}} issue of Croatian boundaries. In 1942, he participated in the Croatian Parliament (Sabor). Two of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> were independently published: The International Political Position of Croatia (Međunarodni politički položaj Hrvatske; 1942) and The Croatian Struggle Against Bolshevism (Hrvatska u borbi protiv boljševizma; 1944). The latter was published in German in 1944.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 {{election}} {{he had some}} sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{parts of}} <b>his</b> Detroit <b>speech</b> {{are similar to}} the one he gave in Washington. In particular, the end of <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> was a longer and more {{detailed}} version of the legendary “I Have a Dream” portion of <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> given two months later in Washington.|$|R

5|$|MalcolmX had by {{now become}} a media favorite, and some Nation members {{believed}} he {{was a threat to}} Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown interest in MalcolmX's autobiography, and when Louis Lomax wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, When the Word Is Given, he used a photograph of MalcolmX on the cover. He also reproduced five of <b>his</b> <b>speeches,</b> but featured only one of Muhammad'sall of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these {{he spoke of the}} need for better schooling. A collection of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Vernon {{reveals that}} the {{auditorium}} where he is giving <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> is actually an endochronic starship, and that during <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> they have all flown {{to the outskirts of}} the Solar System. The graduates felt no acceleration because canceling out time dilation also caused the canceling out of inertia. When Vernon concludes <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> the graduates will be landing in the United Nations Port at Lincoln, Nebraska, where they will be spending the weekend.|$|R

5000|$|Bush gave many {{promises}} during <b>his</b> acceptance <b>speech</b> to the 2004 Republican National Convention. At {{the end of}} <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> {{he encouraged}} listeners to view his website {{in order to learn}} more about his agenda if he wins his next presidential term. <b>His</b> <b>speech</b> promises include the following which his campaign is called [...] "A Plan for A Safer World & More Hopeful America": ...|$|R
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in <b>his</b> <b>speeches,</b> which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Morton {{was elected}} by the Indiana General Assembly {{to serve as a}} U.S. Senator. He {{resigned}} from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker. In the U.S. Senate, Morton {{became a member of the}} foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader. He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections. Because of his stroke, Morton always sat while delivering <b>his</b> <b>speeches,</b> but he was noted by other senators for his effectiveness in speaking and debating.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Tory leader George A. Drew {{unexpectedly}} resigned due to ill health. In his place, the PC party {{elected the}} fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker. The Tories ran a campaign centred {{on their new}} leader, who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television. The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign, and St. Laurent made few television appearances. Uncomfortable with the medium, the Prime Minister read <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> from a script and refused to wear makeup.|$|E

50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> on St. Ambrose day in 2008, he {{said that}} Muslims {{have the right to}} build their mosques in the cities of {{predominantly}} Catholic countries. In <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> on St. Ambrose day 2010 he defended immigrants to Italy against attempts to classify them as criminals.|$|R

5|$|In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{sponsored}} {{a tour of}} the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party. In <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy. Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened to use force to prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{remained}} {{active in}} the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. <b>His</b> <b>speeches</b> were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s {{as he began to}} identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He {{became a member of the}} state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.|$|E
5|$|Periyar openly {{suggested}} {{to those who}} were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E

5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
5|$|The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo {{held their}} final {{demonstration}} in 2006, believing that Kirchner, unlike previous presidents, {{was not their}} enemy. They became political allies of Kirchner, who placed them in prominent locations during <b>his</b> <b>speeches,</b> and the group became a powerful NGO. He further underscored civilian control over the military by appointing Nilda Garré — {{who had been a}} political prisoner during the Dirty War — the country's first woman Minister of Defense. As a result of his policies and approach, relations between the civilian authorities and the military remained tense throughout Kirchner's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{served as}} the Governing Mayor (Regierender Bürgermeister) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984. During his years in office, {{he tried to keep}} alive the idea of a {{cultural}} nation called Germany, divided into two states. In <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> and writings, he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance, but with special obligations and interests in the East. Weizsäcker irritated the United States, France and Britain, the half-city's occupying powers, by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party chief, in East Berlin.|$|E
