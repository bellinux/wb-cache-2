5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Sparta lost its {{position}} as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses <b>failed</b> <b>and</b> Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds}} that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E

25|$|With the {{acquisition}} of the First National Bank in 1869 with his brother-in-law Henry Failing (who became President of the bank. Corbett was Vice-President) and with Corbett serving as the US Senator in Washington from 1867-1873, the combination of their other duties, business acumen and constant drive in recognising new opportunities, meant that their interests went beyond the wholesale market. In February 1871, Corbett’s (previously H.W. Corbett & Co.) and Failing’s (originally J. <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Co. <b>and</b> then <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Hatt) dry goods and hardware businesses were amalgamated into a new major partnership, Corbett, <b>Failing</b> <b>and</b> Co., which became the largest wholesale hardware business in the Pacific Northwest.|$|R

5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) <b>failed</b> <b>and</b> allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E

5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves <b>failed</b> <b>and</b> he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, {{but this time the}} lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that {{she had nothing to}} do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E

The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E

5|$|After Kaga left Nintendo, {{he founded}} a studio called Tirnanog and began {{development}} on a game titled Emblem Saga, a strategy role-playing {{game for the}} PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the Fire Emblem series, and Nintendo {{filed a lawsuit against}} Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> the court ruled in Tirnanog's favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, and this time was awarded a cash settlement of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though they changed its name to Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third lawsuit to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.|$|E

However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations <b>failed,</b> <b>and</b> in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E
