25|$|Domestic servants, {{two-thirds of}} whom were women, made up about fifteen to {{twenty percent of the}} {{population}} of the capital. Before the Revolution they had worked largely for the nobility, whose families sometimes had as many as thirty servants. During the Empire they were employed more commonly by the new nobility, the newly wealthy and middle class. Upper-middle-class families often had three servants; families of artisans and shopkeepers usually had one. Living conditions of servants depended largely upon the personality of the master, but were never easy. Napoleon abolished the death penalty which previously could be given to a servant who stole from his master, but any servant who was even suspected of stealing would never be able to <b>get</b> <b>another</b> <b>job.</b> Any servant who became pregnant, married or not, could be dismissed immediately.|$|E

60|$|A {{week later}} {{the two boys}} were out late in Covent Garden trying to earn a few pence by {{fetching}} up cabs and carriages for people coming out from a concert in the floral hall.

Rachel accepted the promotion and Victor (not knowing that Rachel was an alcoholic) unwittingly caused her to start drinking again when he suggested {{that they have a}} celebratory drink. Rachel's drinking intensified when she learned that her promotion was a sham.|$|R

Pollak was hired by Mandl to restructure other paper manufacturers, including one in the Swiss town of Netstal, where he became the General Director on 1 June 1975. His salary was CHF 1,500, roughly three quarters of the salary of the least paid employee in the company. That is because his remuneration depended on the outcome of restructuring and on the way he ensured the manufacture was profiting.|$|R
