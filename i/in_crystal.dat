40|$|The {{processes}} of ion exchange <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of semiconducting compounds of A 321 B 361 type and <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of ferroelectrics - niobate and lithium tantalate - were investigated {{with the aim}} of the development of both physical and technological principles of ion exchange <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> to be further applied for integral optoelectronics and in the studies of fundamental properties of materials. As a result a physical model of ion exchange in monocrystals was built up. The rules and pecularities of ion exchange processes <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of the A 321 B 361 type and <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of niobate and lithium tantalate were studied. A number of new ion exchange processes were suggested. The thermodynamic and diffusion-kinetic parameters of compounds of the A 321 B 361 type and their hard solutions were determined. The production methods of wave-guide and photosensitive layers <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of the A 321 B 361 type and <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> of niobate and lithium tantalate were developed. The results obtained were introduced into the manufacturing of planar ion exchange lenses.

5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete <b>in</b> <b>crystal</b> form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E

It is shown that elastic nuclei oscillations relatively electron envelops (inherent, I-oscillations) and waves of such oscillations can exist <b>in</b> <b>crystals</b> at adiabatic condition. The types and energy quantums of I-oscillations for different atoms are determined. In this connection the adiabatic crystal model is offered. Each atom in the adiabatic model is submitted as I-oscillator whose stationary oscillatory terms are shown as deep energy levels <b>in</b> <b>crystals.</b> The I-oscillations {{can be created}} {{at the expense of}} recombination energy of electrons and holes on electron-vibrational centers in semiconductors. They interact among themselves, with phonons and electrons, they influence on physical properties of crystals and crystal structures.

The bone samples were heated in temperature of 500, 700, and 900 C° for 15 and 45 min. The results show bone crystals began to change during the first 15 min of heating at 500 C0 and above. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when the samples were heated at lower temperature or for shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes <b>in</b> <b>crystal</b> parameters.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} life-sized concrete model of Megalosaurus for the exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked {{under the direction of}} Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that Megalosaurus would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture <b>in</b> <b>Crystal</b> Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s. Today, they are seen as a separate genus Becklespinax, but Owen referred them to Megalosaurus. The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time, at least in England, that ancient reptiles had existed.|$|E

Chantal also spawned two tornadoes, one <b>in</b> <b>Crystal</b> Beach, Texas and the other in Acadia Parish, Louisiana; both of which caused minor damage. Additionally, 13fatalities occurred, all of them due to drowning; 11deaths occurred offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining two were reported in east-central Texas. Overall, the storm resulted in at least $100million (1989USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|The Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, {{also known}} as Dinosaur Court, {{are a series of}} sculptures of dinosaurs and other extinct animals <b>in</b> <b>Crystal</b> Palace Park, in the London borough of Bromley. Commissioned in 1852 to {{accompany}} the Crystal Palace after its move from the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and unveiled in 1854, they were the first dinosaur sculptures in the world, pre-dating the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by six years. While to varying degrees inaccurate by modern standards, the models were designed and sculpted by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins under the scientific direction of Sir Richard Owen, representing the latest scientific knowledge at the time. The models were classed as Grade II listed buildings from 1973, extensively restored in 2002, and upgraded to Grade I listed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|After this event, Vanille remains with Fang <b>in</b> <b>crystal</b> stasis {{within the}} pillar: from there, the two end up seeing {{everything}} that is going on, remaining unaffected by {{the changes in the}} timeline. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, though still held in the pillar, Vanille and Fang appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in. At the end of the game, they are rescued from the collapsing pillar. In Lightning Returns, Vanille has awoken from crystal stasis with Fang, gaining the ability to hear the voices of the dead. She is dubbed a saint and lives in the city of Luxerion in the protective care of the Order, a religious organization devoted to the deity Bhunivelze. Because of her ability, Vanille is key to a ritual to destroy the dead that will kill her in the process: not knowing the truth about the ritual, she decides to go through with it to atone for her past actions. On the final day, Lightning and Fang persuade Vanille to use her power to free the dead and enable them to be reborn.|$|E
5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another <b>in</b> <b>Crystal</b> Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E

5|$|Diablo Cody {{was first}} {{approached}} {{to write a}} screenplay by film producer Mason Novick, who had previously landed her a book deal for her memoir, , after discovering her blog about stripping. He persuaded her to adapt the book for the screen, but suggested that she first write a screenwriting sample to show studios; that sample became Juno. After deciding on an adoption storyline, Cody collected the stories of adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents, including that of her then-husband, an adoptee who reunited with his birth parents after she wrote the film. She also found inspiration {{in the story of}} a close friend who had become pregnant in high school and used some details from her friend's experience in the film, such as mistreatment from an ultrasound technician. Much of Juno, however, was based on Cody's own high school experiences: She dated a tic-tac-loving boy similar to Paulie, she was best friends with a cheerleader like Leah, and she used a hamburger phone identical to the one that appears in the film. After writing the screenplay over seven weeks in the Starbucks section of a Target store <b>in</b> <b>Crystal,</b> Minnesota, Cody compared writing to breathing, seeing Juno as an extension of herself.|$|E
