5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} an <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of theory, {{and at the same}} time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E
5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated an <b>important</b> <b>point.</b> After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marcher lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the Marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An <b>important</b> <b>point</b> was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Financial {{time series}} were usually large in size, {{unstructured}} and of&# 13; high dimensionality. Since, the illustration of financial time series shape was typically characterized by&# 13; a few number of <b>important</b> <b>points.</b> These <b>important</b> <b>points</b> moved in zigzag directions which could&# 13; form technical patterns. However, these <b>important</b> <b>points</b> exhibited in different resolutions and difficult&# 13; to determine. Approach: In this study, we proposed novel methods of financial time series indexing&# 13; by considering their zigzag movement. The methods consist {{of two major}} algorithms: first, the&# 13; identification of <b>important</b> <b>points,</b> namely the Zigzag-Perceptually <b>Important</b> <b>Points</b> (ZIPs) &# 13; identification method and next, the indexing method namely Zigzag based M-ary Tree (ZM-Tree) to&# 13; structure and organize the <b>important</b> <b>points.</b> Results: The errors of the tree building and retrieving&# 13; compared to the original time series increased when the <b>important</b> <b>points</b> increased. The dimensionality&# 13; reduction using ZM-Tree based on tree pruning and number of retrieved points techniques performed&# 13; better {{when the number of}} <b>important</b> <b>points</b> increased.

The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an <b>important</b> <b>point</b> in the case as other charges were brought.

5|$|The growing {{importance}} of royal {{art can be}} seen in the post of Painter and Limner, created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included drawing pictures of the Monarch's person, his successors and members of the royal family, for the decoation of royal houses and palaces. However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability. Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, Robert and the younger James, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. They tutored artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. Italy became an <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of reference for Scottish artists, with many taking the Grand Tour there to paint, sample the art and learn from Italian masters.|$|E

25|$|Port Royal {{is one of}} the area's more {{historic}} towns.

25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality.

25|$|A very <b>important</b> <b>point</b> to {{consider}} is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E

25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release.

25|$|Another <b>important</b> <b>point</b> to {{consider}} is that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we now know that a diamond's appearance is composed of many light paths that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we can see that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E
