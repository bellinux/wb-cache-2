This dissertation focuses on cost minimization and on establishing operational policies for query distribution over heterogeneous, geographically distributed databases.

Ellison asked executive producer Irving Elman about the name change, {{and was told that}} there'd been a number of jokes about it and references to the Leopold and Loeb murder case. Elman was afraid viewers would make the same connection. Subsequent to this interview, Ellison said he received a letter from a Minneapolis hotline worker, Martha Rosen.

50|$|When dialing numbers {{one at a}} time, {{there are}} two sources of delay. First, only some {{fraction}} of dials are answered. So, for example, if 1 out of 3 dials are answered, a predictive dialer might <b>dial</b> 3 <b>lines</b> every time an agent becomes available. Second, even dials that are answered take some time before being picked up. If it typically takes 10 seconds for someone to pick up, and conversations typically last 90 seconds, a predictive dialer might start dialing at 80 seconds.|$|R

50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The <b>dial</b> tone <b>lines</b> for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks.|$|R

50|$|Another type {{of remote}} office {{is known as}} Remote Carrier Urban (RCU). Such units {{typically}} reside {{on the side of}} a road in a large box, approx 3 meters across, almost 2 meters high and almost a meter through. In the 1980s many telcos installed an early version of these instead of pulling more cable into a remote area. They were much cheaper and could provide up to approx 500 lines. Back then they needed two 'boxes' to work- a host box called a Central Terminal (CT) that had the <b>dial</b> tone <b>lines</b> wired into it and a remote box called a Remote terminal (RT) where the dial tone 'came out'. They used 2-6 T1 links on copper - i.e. LD-1 or fiber. As Telcos modernized, these same remote boxes were re-configured to work directly from a SMU peripheral at the host DMS. Typically each SMU can handle 3-6 RCUs.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a <b>dial</b> and trunk <b>lines</b> to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R
50|$|Some tide dials have a stone gnomon, {{but many}} have a {{circular}} hole {{which is used}} to hold a more easily replaced or adjusted wooden gnomon.

If you wanted to call long distance you {{would be required to}} buy a prepaid long distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long distance plan which would allow you to make long distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid in advance. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid before you even used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying.|$|R
