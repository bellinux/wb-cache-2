However, in many customer-facing, goal orientated and revenue generating activities, contrary to expectations, they display similar attitudes and behaviours to those in senior sales roles. This challenges the way that the KAM role has previously been conceptualized.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management (KAM) relationships. In doing so, it aimed to address a number of gaps in the existing literature, particularly a noticeable lack of research into <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management in developing economies, as opposed to developed economies. More specifically, the {{study sought to}} examine the dynamics of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management relationships in an emerging economy in the Arab World. The main research question to address was: How is KAM relationship management applied in an Arab context? The research utilised 50 cross-sectional semi-structured in-depth interviews to achieve the study’s aim. More specifically, the study was based upon a sample of recipients involved with <b>key</b> <b>accounts</b> from supplier organisations which operated in different sectors and had different ownership – local and foreign. Primary data was gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews primarily with <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers,</b> and with company directors, marketing and sales managers, and selling/support teams. In general, the findings revealed that there are informal and formal aspects of KAM relationships in an Arab context that complement each other. These have some similarities and differences with the Western context. In particular, similarities appeared mainly along the formal aspects such as, roles and duties of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> (KAMgrs), identification and selection criteria of <b>key</b> <b>accounts,</b> special treatment and activities carried out with key customers; the actors involved including senior managers and support teams; and the resources utilised. However, differences existed in the selection and the recruitment criteria and some competencies that were Arab specific, the degree of involvement of senior managers differ significantly from what is noted in the KAM literature. As for the informal aspect, that is manifested in Wasta and family connections, trust, and personal involvement, which makes the KAM relationship management approach in an Arab context uniquely different and {{plays a major role in}} how customers are acquired and retained and the overall management of key customers. Furthermore, evidence shows that there is a tendency to transfer Western KAM practices to the Arab world, with some adaptation to take into consideration the country-specific and contextual factors. Overall, it is argued, that the study’s findings contribute to existing knowledge in a number of ways. First, they extend our knowledge into <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management in an Arab context and confirm the importance of both the formal and informal aspects in managing KAM relationships. They also add weight to the view that in Arab cultures personal and affective/emotional dimensions of the relational factors are given more importance, compared to the impersonal and calculative aspects that are more emphasised in the West. The findings contribute to existing knowledge regarding KAM segmentation and the importance of the personal profile in an Arab context vis a vis the business profile, and they validate the view that a process of crossvergence of management practices is occurring across borders. The findings, however, challenge the view that KAM can be rolled out unchanged into any international context. They also discover the competencies required for Arab KAMgrs. Finally the findings contribute to existing knowledge by discovering the benefits of Wasta for <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Key Account Management {{has become}} more and more {{important}} because of the need to retain and develop relationships with large and global businesses. Key Account Management is about managing a journey that commences at the first contact with the client and then goes through a series of stages and then develops into a complex relationship based on trust and mutual interest. There are many factors influencing the journey along the way and the responsibility to coordinate the supplier’s activities and bring added value to the relationship is the function of the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager.</b> In this thesis we discuss the area of key account relationships from the selling company’s perspective. We have chosen to focus on how a company identify/select and characterize a key account, the development of a key account relationship and finally the work of a <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager.</b> In order to reach the purpose of the thesis we have conducted two interviews with a company that has employed Key Account Management for many years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer a {{framework}} for the role of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management systems in knowledge transfer, especially in the context of an expert organisation. Expert organisations constitute an interesting focus of analysis, while loosely coupled characteristics of that specific context might inhibit knowledge sharing.

40|$|A growing {{scholarly}} {{interest in}} <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management highlights {{the need for a}} framework to use in the study of these accounts. This study combines theory from relationship marketing, personal selling, and organizational-level resource allocation studies to build an integrative theoretical framework explaining both relational and performance aspects of <b>key</b> <b>accounts.</b> In building this integrative model, a qualitative study of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> revealed that “fit ” between the buying and selling company is of great importance. This concept of fit, which has largely been ignored in <b>key</b> <b>account</b> studies, is added as both an antecedent and a moderator in the integrative model. In recent years, marketing scholars and practitioners have embraced two important environmental shifts in marketing. First, the migration from short-term, transactional exchanges to long-term, relational exchanges (Rackham and DeVincentis 1999; Webster 1992). Second, marketers are increasingly moving away from the assumption that customer demand is homogeneous and are accepting the reality that customers are heterogeneous with respect to the value they provide to the selling firm (Hunt and Morgan 1995; Niraj, Gupta, and Narasimhan 2001).

40|$|Purpose: Over {{the past}} ten to 15 years, <b>key</b> <b>account</b> {{management}} (KAM) has established itself as an important and growing field of academic study and as a major issue for practitioners. Despite the use of strategic intent in conceptualizing KAM relationship types, the role of strategic intent has not previously been empirically tested. This paper aims {{to address this issue}} Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on inductive research that used a dyadic methodology and difference modelling to examine nine <b>key</b> <b>account</b> relationship dyads involving 18 companies. This is supplemented with 13 semi-structured interviews with <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> from a further 13 companies, which provides additional depth of understanding of the drivers of KAM relationship type. Findings: The research found a misalignment of strategic intent between supplier and customer, which suggested that strategic intent is unrelated to relationship type. In contrast, key buyer/supplier relationships were differentiated not by the level of strategic fit or intent, but by contact structure and differentiated service. Practical implications: This research showed that there can be stable <b>key</b> <b>account</b> relationships even where there is an asymmetry of strategic interests. The findings also have practical implications relating to the selection and management of <b>key</b> <b>accounts.</b> Originality/value: These results raise questions relating to conceptualizations of such relationships, both in the classroom and within businesses. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|Even though Sweden {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly {{developed}} countries in the world when it comes to the observance of gender equality, there are still many professions in which the distribution between men and women are vastly uneven. One of these is the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> profession, where around 80 - 90 % of the persons chosen for the task are men. Taking on a controversial type of feministic approach, this thesis investigates if there is room for a change in the currently uneven gender distribution by suggesting that female attributes, especially nurturing ability, would be more preferable in key account management than male attributes, such as assertiveness. By visiting the variety of research on gender stereotypes, which many studies show still are alive, and choosing the gender-based personality traits that fitted best under the conceptualization of modern key account management, a framework for a questionnaire was created. Respondents from mainly large manufacturing business-to-business companies in capacity of mainly purchasing managers were asked to participate and give their opinion about the importance of the different personality traits. The results were due to the hypothesized proposition. Data clearly showed that the most preferable <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> attributes from the customers’ perspective were predominantly what could be considered to be female attributes. However, the results also showed that a significant share of the respondents were not prone to ascribe attributes to gender, but rather to personality, adding an inevitable and interesting dimension for further analysis. The main implications of the study are versatile and could be considered controversial, but do entail some concrete implications, especially for management: a person possessing female attributes, likely a woman, might be more beneficial to hire for a <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> position...|$|E
40|$|Acting in a {{boundary}} spanning role within their organisations, the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> in representing their customers’ needs internally {{is required to}} manage {{a wide range of}} complex internal relationships. This can often lead to incidents of conflict between the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> and other individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation in non-sales functions. Using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), (Flanagan, 1954) together with an interpretive framework for data coding (Spiggle, 1994), this research investigates conflict and the key account manager’s internal selling role. This research also explores how the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> perceives intraorganisational, interpersonal conflicts and investigates the complex behavioural sequences adopted to manage them. In doing so this research addresses some of the shortcomings of the traditional view of the nature of organisational conflict and how it is managed while extending our understanding of the key account manager’s internal selling role. In contrast to the majority of research into personal selling, this research takes an interpretive approach through the analysis of transcripts from a series of CIT interviews with key account managers in the field. Twenty-nine key account managers from seven participating FMCG, Blue Chip organisations in the U. K. and U. S. participated in the research. From the CIT interviews conducted, 112 critical incidents were described with both positive and negative outcomes. This research provides further insight into the complexity of conflict, suggesting conflict is inherent within the key account management internal selling role, that incidents of conflict do not occur in isolation, that these conflict episodes are complex, having multiple components and that a combination of behaviours can be used in their management. In addressing these issues in the key account management context, this research further develops our knowledge of personal selling and the key account manager’s internal selling role by providing an analysis of the recollections of how conflict is perceived and managed by the key account managers involved.

40|$|There {{has been}} a shift in recent decades in the {{business-to-business}} field in terms of advancements in technology and increased competition, thus leading to organisations become more attentive on embedding with customers. This concept {{is referred to as}} relationship management and a further concept to embed with strategically important customers is referred to as key account management. The use of key account management has been described as highly individual and it is implemented in various ways and has different approaches. However, it was found that {{there is a lack of}} research regarding important aspects of key account management and how they are conducted in practices in mid-sized organisations with and without a formal key account management programmes. The identified aspects were relationship management, key account management, <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager,</b> key accounts, key account teams and involvement from top management. By aiming to bridge this gap in research, the authors conducted in-depth interviews in two mid- sized organisations in Sweden, one with an implemented key account management programme and one without any formal key account management.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} different strategic roles of the sales manager in key account management. This thesis looks at the different strategic roles of the key account management (KAM) {{from the perspective of}} the sales manager. Previous researches have mainly based on fact that sales manager responds to top-management, and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> responds to sales manager. Sales manager is typically seen as key account manager’s direct superior and at the same time, sales manager is responsible for key account manager’s performance to the top-management. According Flaherty and others (2012) sales literature follows a top-down approach and based on sales management specific behaviors to improve poor performance. Nevertheless, today’s research has had more nuances that sales manager’s and key account managers job is more collaboration. Reality of today’s sales manager role have changed from top-down, leader-centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships (Flaherty and others 2012). This thesis tries to show that sales manager’s role is not only to be key account managers superior. Key account manager’s and sales manager’s dynamic relationship is unnerved in previous researches. Actually, <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> and sales manager has intense interaction and the information flows one to another and also they both effect on each other’s performance. Sales manager and <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>manager,</b> as a conclusion, can be seen as team more than monitored — supervisor partners. According Flaherty and others (2012) reality of today’s sales manager role have changed from top-down, leader- centered paradigm to more like collaboration which comes a vast network of complex relationships. The findings from the interview shows the same; all the interviewees said that nowadays sales managers should collaborate with KAMs. Still, there are seen the effect of regulations, rules and laws which change the style of leadership. Also sales manager take part on operative work. The previous academic literature stated that sales manager position is like invisible. That means sales manager won’t take part that much on operative work. In every interview the result was that operative work with customers is one part of every sales manager job in practice. Motivating KAMs to perform better is important. In a sales oriented organizations everybody knows how much the expected sales target are for KAM’s and at the same time sales manager need to provide all the needed rules that KAM’s could achieve those sales targets. Also this thesis finds out that organizational culture could effect on sales manager’s performance. It could create boundaries between sales manager and KAM but also it could provide framework which help everyday operations in the organization...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of <b>Key</b> <b>Account</b> Management (KAM) in today’s business environment, there is a dearth of quality research investigating the mechanisms through which companies’ implement KAM and the likely success of the program. This is especially highlighted {{by many of the}} common posts found on KAM Best Practice Knowledge Share asking seemingly simple questions, which appear to have no concrete answers. In the last two months we have seen questions on account planning templates (I would advise checking out Prof. Lynette Ryals book “Key Account Plans” as a start point for this, and see Richard Ilsley’s Webinar), the differences between KA Managers and Sales People (Chapter 10 of Diana Woodburn and Prof. Malcolm McDonald’s book “Key Account Management” is good – or you could check out Davies and Ryals “Attitudes and behaviours of <b>key</b> <b>account</b> managers: are they really any different from senior sales professionals?” for an academic view-point), criteria for selecting <b>Key</b> <b>Accounts</b> (again see either of the above books on this) and what I am dealing with in this report – How do you measure KAM success and appropriately reward <b>Key</b> <b>Account</b> <b>Managers.</b> Such a simple question should have a simple answer – but doesn’t. Having undertaken a thorough review of literature on KAM I can confirm that, at best, our current knowledge on both measurement and rewards is anecdotal. Authors say it is really important to get measurement and rewards right. They even suggest what should be measured; in particular Chapter 11 of Woodburn and McDonald (2011) lists potential measures and rewards for KAM, which influenced the design of this study, but we have no idea if any of this works. This research paper aims to provide a starting point for this missing link. However, first we need to discuss performance...|$|R
40|$|Traditional, product-driven {{capital goods}} {{suppliers}} have gradually grown {{in size and}} become more global. Simultaneously <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management has become the dominant approach for them to manage their business customers. The {{purpose of the study}} is to describe and analyse, how <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management is organized in global supplier companies which operate in capital goods market. <b>Key</b> <b>account</b> management is seen as a strategic approach, the aim of which is to add value to the supplier–customer relationship. The organizational considerations are regarded {{as a part of the}} process of implementing <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management into the company. When developing from product-driven approach to customer-driven approach, a company usually goes through several phases. Adoption of customer-driven approach brings about changes to the organizational structure as well as to the roles within the organization. When a company plans for the location of people in charge of the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management, it needs to analyse its own organization, the business environment and the <b>key</b> <b>accounts.</b> Decentralized, centralized and compromised organizational structure models are considered as principal options, each of which have different characteristics regarding adaptation to customers, power positions and communication. Qualitative approach and multiple case study method are used in this study, since a comprehensive understanding of the case companies is sought. Altogether three global supplier companies are analysed on the basis of information obtained through interviews of seven managers with several years of experience from <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management. Theme interview being close to natural conversations is used for the interviews. Cross-case comparison is chosen as the analysis approach to identify the similarities and differences in the case companies. The results give evidence to the companies’ evolution from product-driven to customer-driven organization. Furthermore, the supplier’s offering, the roles of the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers,</b> industry-related and country-based differences as well as an in-depth view of the accounts and their decision-making structures are emphasized when plans for <b>key</b> <b>account</b> management are made. The centralized structure is preferred because of its clear role within the organization, while the decentralized structure is described as difficult to manage. Suppliers seek adaptation to customers by using a multilevel approach with customized account teams in managing the <b>key</b> <b>account</b> relationships. Finally, systematic management and clear definition of roles help companies minimize the issues concerning power positions and communication. <b>Key</b> words: <b>Key</b> <b>account</b> management, business-to-business, customer-driven organization, organizational structur...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{understand}} {{the factors that influence}} a supplier’s choice to treat selected customers more preferentially than others. Suppliers often lack the resources to treat all their customers equally, instead having to make choices to treat some customers as preferred. Empirical evidence indicates that preferential treatment by suppliers provides substantial benefits for the purchasing firm. Design/methodology/approach – This study applies a mixed-methods approach. First, a qualitative analysis of a sample of buyers from an automotive manufacturer was conducted. In the second step, the findings were triangulated via a quantitative survey among <b>key</b> <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> of the automotive firm’s suppliers. Findings – This paper is the first to provide quantitative data collected from a large sample of automotive suppliers about the drivers of preferential customer treatment. The authors were able to show that the growth opportunities for suppliers and customers’ operative excellence, reliability and relational behavior are factors that induce suppliers to award preferential customer treatment. In contrast, innovation potential for suppliers, customers’ support of suppliers, supplier involvement and contact accessibility do not show a significant effect on suppliers’ behavioral intentions toward preferential customer treatment. Originality/value – The mixed-methods approach is introduced as a form of academic enquiry in supply chain management. The factors influencing preferential customer treatment by suppliers are explored in discussions with purchasers and validated in a subsequent survey among suppliers. Recommendations for managerial practice and theory are drawn...|$|R
