AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a Global Hawk <b>Drone</b> <b>of</b> NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine. NASA has denied the hack, asserting that {{the control of the}} drones were never compromised, but has acknowledged that the photos released along with the content are real photographs of its employees, but that most of these data are already available in the public domain.|$|E
25|$|Accounts are {{conflicting}} {{regarding the}} exact {{form of the}} Hungarian bagpipe. Cocks describes it as similar to the Bulgarian one which has a chanter and a bass drone but no tenor drone. Baines (pp. 77-79) gives Hungary {{as one of the}} countries possessing the duda, which has this construction, also a Hungarian bagpipe with a diple (i.e., twin-bore) chanter, one bore of which gives a variable drone, the bag pipe having a bass drone in addition. Robert Bright in Travels through Lower Hungary(1818), quoted by Flood (p. 79), describes the Hungarian bagpipe as having two drones and a chanter of square section (in other worlds the Dudelsack). Fraser (p. 243) has a picture of a Hungarian bagpipe with one chanter and one <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> medium length, probably a bass drone. It seems possible that all these forms of the instrument may be in use.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{excess power}} index (integrating body dry mass, thorax-to-body dry mass and wing surface area) was {{compared}} in <b>drones</b> <b>of</b> seven Asian Apis species. There are two statistically distinct groups <b>of</b> drones: <b>drones</b> <b>of</b> the dwarf honeybees form one class, all other Asian species {{belong to the}} second. <b>Drones</b> <b>of</b> dwarf honeybees have a 36 % ergonomic advantage in power availability and 20 % advantage in available excess power over all other <b>drones.</b> Comparisons <b>of</b> flight dimensions between conspecific workers and drones show a highly statistically significant sexual dimorphism for flight. Although <b>drones</b> <b>of</b> all seven tested species are always bigger than their workers their excess power index is some 15 % better. It is suggested that prowess <b>of</b> flight in <b>drones</b> {{is driven by the}} need to compete and mate with queens flying high in the air while worker bees forage nectar and pollen on flowers...|$|R

On 8 November the unit was moved to RAF Leuchars and then on 29 November back to No. 11 Group RAF in the south at RAF Tangmere near Chichester in West Sussex. The squadron remained idle for the winter as The Blitz and the German night attacks began and lasted in to the following spring. Finucane billeted near Oving. While drinking at a nearby pub overlooking the harbour an air raid struck Southampton. Finucane heard the <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> German bombers over the Isle of Wight {{in the distance and}} watched as the pathfinders marked the city.

A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical <b>drone</b> <b>of</b> Sugarcube-like techno-tunes.

The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really not that good.

It doesn't quite attain the critical mass to transcend its basis in the most rudimentary garage punk of the Sixties... Side Two is pretty much one long tribute to The Stooges...
