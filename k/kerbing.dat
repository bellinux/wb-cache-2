5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} racing lap, Vettel led by 2.8 seconds from Webber, who was {{followed}} by Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Massa, Button, Schumacher, Kubica, Hülkenberg, Sutil, Barrichello, Kobaysahi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Liuzzi, Buemi, Glock, Petrov, Kovalainen, Yamamoto, Trulli, Senna and di Grassi. Alonso chose a cautious approach and lost four to five seconds while building up his pace slowly in the early stages. Sutil ran off the circuit but continued after losing his position to both Williams drivers. Webber lost grip on the next lap after running across the outside <b>kerbing</b> and spinning across the track onto the wall between turns twelve and thirteen; he slid back onto the circuit and collected Rosberg, forcing both drivers to retire. The debris on-track from the accident called the safety car to be deployed. Kobayashi, Petrov, Heidfeld and Buemi all made pit stops for intermediate tyres during the safety car period.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton {{began to}} pull away from Rosberg, leading his {{teammate}} by 4.3 seconds by the start of lap 36. Bottas moved to the outside line heading into the Rettifilo chicane on the following lap and Magnussen responded by steering towards the inside line, causing Bottas to mount the <b>kerbing</b> to avoid a collision but passed the McLaren car. Shortly afterwards, Magnussen was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty by the stewards for his role in forcing Bottas off the track in the latter's earlier overtaking attempt. Button passed Pérez around the inside driving into the Rettifilo chicane for seventh on lap 39, but Pérez responded by going alongside Button through the Curva Grande corner and the Variante della Roggia chicane. Pérez was forced wide onto the Variante della Roggia chicane <b>kerbing</b> but took the inside line and regained seventh place from Button at the Curva di Lesmo turns. On the following lap, Bottas passed Vettel to move into fourth at the Rettifilo chicane and his teammate Ricciardo overtook Button for seventh at the same turn. Ricciardo drew close to Pérez and pressured latter into locking his brakes entering the Rettifilo chicane. He achieved a good rhythm through the Curva Grande corner, and moved lanes, passing Pérez around the outside to take over seventh at the Variante della Roggia chicane on lap 41.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton, despite {{complaining}} of brake vibrations, set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 47.490 seconds on the super soft compound tyres in the second practice session; Alonso was second and Ricciardo third. Räikkönen was fourth-fastest with Vettel in fifth. The two McLaren drivers were sixth and seventh (with Magnussen ahead of Button) and Pérez, Nico Hülkenberg and Kvyat followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted halfway through when Pastor Maldonado drove too quickly through the tenth turn, lost control of his car's rear-end, and slid into the outside exit barriers, heavily damaging his vehicle's front-right hand corner. After the session ended, Lotus constructed a new E22 chassis overnight for Maldonado, which he used {{for the remainder of}} the race meeting. In the final practice session, which was held in cloudy weather conditions, Alonso set the fastest lap of the weekend so far at one minute and 47.299 seconds, 0.051 seconds faster than Ricciardo in second and Rosberg was third after going slowly in the first sector and went over the turn eleven <b>kerbing.</b> Vergne was fourth-fastest; Vettel was fifth and Hamilton sixth. Massa was seventh-fastest, Bottas eighth, Räikkönen ninth and Esteban Gutiérrez completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|Vergne {{recorded}} the fastest overall timed lap of all drivers {{in the group}} stages in the fourth group at 53.286 seconds, 0.135 seconds quicker than the second-placed Piquet. Rosenqvist, López and Abt were the group's slowest three drivers. After group qualifying ended, the times set by Vergne, Engel, Buemi, Piquet and di Grassi were fast enough to progress them into super pole. Di Grassi was the first driver to attempt his lap in super pole and {{lost control of the}} rear-end of his car, making contact with the wall leaving Anthony Noughes corner and qualified in second. Piquet was initially slower than di Grassi but recovered some of the lost time and took third place. Buemi drove cleanly to clinch the provisional pole position with a time of 53.313 seconds. Engel drove over a large section of <b>kerbing,</b> drifting sideways into the barrier and was restricted to starting fifth. Vergne struggled with finding grip, locked his tyres heading into Sainte Dévote corner and qualified no higher than fourth. This meant Buemi secured his first pole position of the season, his second consecutive in Monaco, the seventh of his career, and his first since the 2016 London ePrix. He also became the fifth consecutive driver to clinch the pole position in the season's first five races. After qualifying ended, Duval was sent {{to the back of the}} grid for exceeding the maximum amount of permitted laps.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, Buemi led di Grassi, Piquet, Vergne, Heidfeld, Engel, Bird, Rosenqvist, Frijns, López, Abt, Evans, Gutiérrez, Turvey, Carroll, Félix da Costa, Prost, d'Ambrosio, Duval and Sarrazin. Buemi began to pull away from di Grassi, {{establishing}} a lead of one second over him. The field settled down for the next six laps with nothing notable of note occurring. On lap eight, Bird went over the <b>kerbing</b> at Tabac corner, lost control of the rear-end of his car, and veered into the barrier, damaging his rear suspension. Bird was forced to make a pit stop, while his teammate López was shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to stop for repairs to his rear wing. Bird's mechanics repaired his vehicle's rear-end with a spanner and replaced López's rear wing. Both drivers returned to the track to commence a battle for the race's fastest lap. Buemi continued to extend his advantage over di Grassi and Piquet while Rosenqvist was challenging Engel for sixth. Frijns lost eighth when Abt passed him around the outside and closed up to the Engel and Rosenqvist battle. Piquet struggled to remain within sight of the leading drivers, and Vergne ran closely behind him, steering left onto the inside line. As both drivers locked their tyres, Piquet clambered with his steering wheel, and both cars made contact; Vergne ended his race in the Novelle Chicane barrier on lap 21.|$|E

500|$|After {{providing}} {{teams with}} the ultrasoft compound for the Monaco and Canadian Grands Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli made the supersoft, soft and medium compounds {{available for the}} race despite the ultrasoft compound being specifically designed for street circuits. Pirelli explained {{the decision not to}} provide the ultrasoft tyres as being a result of a lack of available performance data on the circuit, while most teams opted for a full complement of soft and supersoft tyres and taking only the minimum number of medium compound tyres dictated by the rules. In preparing for the race, Pirelli acknowledged concerns about the circuit's high speed straights and direction changes causing [...] "standing waves" [...] over longer runs, a phenomenon whereby the energy passing through the wheel is strong enough to shift the build of the tyre, compromising its rigidity and increasing the likelihood of tyre failures. Further concerns were raised {{about the impact of the}} temporary surface used to protect the cobblestones through the Old City section on the tyres, amid fears that predicted high temperatures throughout the weekend would cause this surface to break up. Following the first free practice session, it was found that the metal bolts used to anchor segments of <b>kerbing</b> to the roadway had started working loose and had been cutting into the rubber of the tyres, necessitating minor modifications to the circuit in order to correct the issue.|$|E
500|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Rosberg set the fastest time {{in the second and third}} sessions to clinch his eighth pole position of the season, the twelfth of his career and his first at Suzuka with a lap time of one minute and 32.506 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Hamilton, who recorded a lap time nearly two-tenths of a second slower than his teammate. Hamilton's car was launched into the air by hitting the chicane <b>kerbing</b> [...] before accelerating too fast entering the final corner, preventing him from achieving the pole position. Williams teammates Bottas and Massa qualified third and fourth, and Alonso and Ricciardo took fifth and sixth. Mangnussen, whose mistakes on his quickest timed lap cost him time, took seventh. His McLaren teammate, Button, secured eighth and locked one of his tyres—flat-spotting it and slowing his times. Vettel, struggling on corners due partially to Red Bull's use of wet tyres, finished ninth. Räikkönen rounded out the top ten qualifiers, encountering problems with his car's balance which prevented him from pushing hard.|$|E

2500|$|Alonso {{believed}} {{the timing of}} the safety car and not a strategy error prevented him from achieving a podium finish, saying if Ferrari had Mercedes's pace, they would remain on track: [...] "The moment of the safety car was probably not good, but sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't help. Today it didn't help." [...] Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci defended his team's strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented his team from finishing on the podium: [...] "Definitely the safety car didn't do any better for us, but the race is made of 60 laps. We squeezed the car as much as we could; the strategy from the pits was excellent. There were other variables we know we cannot control. We did our best." [...] Boullier suggested Red Bull used coded messages to assist Ricciardo when they told Ricciardo to remain off the <b>kerbing</b> but stressed it was the FIA's task to investigate. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner spoke to Whiting for clarification because Ricciardo had battery damage from going over the <b>kerbing.</b> The sport's governing body confirmed they were satisfied with Red Bull's radio messages and stated the team abided by the regulations.|$|E

He found the drinks bottle content very hot to consume and complained over the radio that it burned his mouth. Magnussen raised his arms out of his cockpit to direct cool air down his sleeves and onto his back to alleviate the pain. The driver called his tenth-place finish [...] "the hardest-earnt point I've ever had" [...] and the McLaren team principal Éric Boullier said his performance under the circumstances was a [...] "scant consolidation" [...] and reserved praise for Magnussen being [...] "indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit".
