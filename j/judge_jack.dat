5|$|In 2009, Superior Court <b>Judge</b> <b>Jack</b> Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed {{a lawsuit}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S. {{companies}} for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed {{that the use of}} Agent Orange violated the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, 1925 Geneva Protocol, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, <b>Judge</b> <b>Jack</b> B. Weinstein of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law {{at the time of its}} use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government. Weinstein used the British example to help dismiss the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.|$|E

The panel was headed by Ninth Circuit Chief Justice Alex Kozinski, Circuit judge Susan P.

5000|$|<b>Judge</b> Raymond <b>Jack</b> QC {{held that}} the Government {{had no right to}} {{rescission}} or damages. The contract could not have been rescinded because the plane had been sold. So counter restitution was impossible. It followed that s 2(2) damages were unavailable, because damages are dependent according to the provision's wording on the right to rescission. Damages are available only as a substitute for rescission when the court believes damages are more equitable as a solution. <b>Judge</b> Raymond <b>Jack</b> QC said, ...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after her}} dismissal, Myers filed a Section 1983 suit {{in federal court}} for the Eastern District of Louisiana, against Connick both {{personally}} and in his official capacity. She alleged violation of her First Amendment rights and sought back pay, reinstatement and compensatory and punitive damages. At first she sought a preliminary injunction, but <b>Judge</b> <b>Jack</b> Gordon converted it to a trial on the merits. It was held before him {{two months after the}} firing. Myers argued that she had been fired for distributing the questionnaire; Connick claimed {{it was a matter of}} her insubordination in refusing to accept the transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Connick v. Myers, [...] (1983), is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{concerning the}} First Amendment rights of public employees who speak {{on matters of}} possible public concern within the workplace context. It was first brought by Sheila Myers, an Orleans Parish, Louisiana, assistant district attorney (ADA). She had been fired by her superior, District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., when, after receiving a transfer she had fiercely resisted in private conversations {{with him and his}} chief assistant district attorney, she distributed a questionnaire to her fellow prosecutors asking about their experience with Connick's management practices. At trial, <b>Judge</b> <b>Jack</b> Gordon of the Eastern District of Louisiana found the firing had been motivated by the questionnaire and was thus an infringement on her right to speak out on matters of public concern as a public employee. After the Fifth Circuit affirmed the verdict, Connick appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|A December 2006 New York Times article {{based on}} leaked company {{documents}} {{concluded that the}} company had engaged in a deliberate effort to downplay olanzapine's side effects. The company denied these allegations and stated that the article had been based on cherry picked documents. [...] The documents were provided to the Times by Jim Gottstein, a lawyer who represented mentally ill patients, who obtained them from a doctor, David Egilman, who was serving as an expert consultant on the case. [...] In 2007 Lilly filed a protection order to stop the dissemination of some of the documents, which <b>Judge</b> <b>Jack</b> B. Weinstein of the Brooklyn Federal District Court granted, and criticized the New York Times reporter, Gottstein, and Egilman in the ruling. [...] The Times of London also received the documents and reported that as early as 1998, Lilly considered the risk of drug-induced obesity to be a [...] "top threat" [...] to Zyprexa sales.

2500|$|In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed {{a lawsuit}} against William Weber (the defense lawyer for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had {{examined}} the house), along with Good Housekeeping magazine, the New York Sunday News and the Hearst Corporation, all of which had published articles related to the hauntings. The Lutzes alleged invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names for trade purposes, and mental distress, and claimed $4.5million in damages. Hoffman, Weber, and Burton immediately filed a countersuit for $2million alleging fraud and breach of contract. The claims against the news corporations were dropped for lack of evidence, and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn U.S. District Court <b>judge</b> <b>Jack</b> B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes' claims and observed in his ruling: [...] "Based on what I have heard, it appears to me that to a large extent the book is a work of fiction, relying in a large part upon the suggestions of Mr. Weber." [...] In the September 17, 1979 issue of People magazine, William Weber wrote: [...] "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." [...] This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: [...] "There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents." ...|$|E
