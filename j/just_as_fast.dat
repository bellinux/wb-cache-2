Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E

500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

2500|$|Normally, {{a breath}} is taken every other stroke. This can be {{sustained}} over long distances. Often, breathing every stroke slows the swimmer down. (At a certain level, a breathing stroke becomes <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> as a nonbreathing stroke; therefore, very experienced competitors, such as Michael Phelps, may breathe every stroke.) Other intervals of breathing practised by elite swimmers include the [...] "two up, one down" [...] approach in which the swimmer breathes for two successive strokes and then keeps their head in the water on the next stroke, which is easier on the lungs. Swimmers with good lung capacity might also breathe every 3rd stroke during sprints for the finish. Some swimmers can even hold their breaths for an entire race (assuming {{that it is a}} short one). To be able to swim with best results {{it is important to keep}} one's head down when taking a breath. If the swimmer lifts his or her head too high the swimmer's hips often drop, creating drag, thus slowing the swimmer down. The closer one's head is to the water the better one swim is the general technique used by swimmers.|$|E

After Westbourne House, Colvin followed {{in the footsteps of}} England women's captain Clare Connor by playing in the boys' team at Brighton College. Competing in the Lord's Taverners under-15 Cup in 2004, Colvin and fellow Brightonian Sarah Taylor were the only girls amongst the 1,000 participating teams. Colvin and Taylor's involvement in the competition caused controversy within the MCC, with president Robin Marlar calling their inclusion [...] "absolutely outrageous". He proceeded to argue that, [...] "if there's an 18-year-old who can bowl at 80mph and he's been brought up properly then he shouldn't want to hurt a lady at any cost". [...] Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, dismissed the comments as [...] "show a huge generation gap"; Colvin herself commented that [...] "we just thought it was funny... don't treat me any different. They bowl at me <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> and hit the ball just as hard". [...] On a cricket tour to Sri Lanka in December 2004, {{she was one of the}} last people to play at the Galle International Stadium before it was flattened by the tsunami of Boxing Day that year.

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1966 however, {{multiple}} sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as [...] "a barbaric aggressive war of conquest" [...] and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal {{as a means to}} condemn the American effort. The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed Averell Harriman [...] "Ambassador for Peace" [...] to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October. Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians and New Zealanders. The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia. For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November. Nevertheless, in December Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. In a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was [...] "trying to win it <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> as I can in every way that I know how" [...] and later stated that he needed [...] "all the help I can get." ...|$|E

50|$|Power metal guitarists and bassists {{generally}} play rapid {{streams of}} notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed. The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal <b>just</b> <b>as</b> the <b>fast</b> rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal. Power metal often {{makes use of}} Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some {{of the most influential}} and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.|$|R
