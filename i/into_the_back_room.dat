25|$|The pair leave, {{and walk}} along the streets taking turns {{carrying}} the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease the narrative out of the emotional climax of the scene, helping to prepare the audience for the twists and emotion of the following scene, the true climax of the play. Tamashima Ittō is invited <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> of the shop for a drink, perhaps in part in thanks for pointing out the thieves.|$|E
25|$|The next scene {{takes place}} in this back room. Drunk, Tamashima draws his sword and reveals himself as Nippon Daemon in a rousing speech, before {{demanding}} Kōbei hand over {{all the money in}} the shop. Though Rikimaru and Kozō have made off with 100 ryō, the entire ordeal was a ruse to help Daemon earn Kōbei's trust, and to get himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room.</b> Sōnosuke throws himself between the two, offering his own life instead of that of his father-in-law; Daemon stops, noting that he once had a son who would be roughly Sōnosuke's age. The two older men begin to talk about their pasts and come to the realization that not only is Daemon Sōnosuke's true father, but Kōbei is in fact Kozō's true father. Both men, for differing reasons, lost their sons at a crowded ritual ceremony at the Hase-dera over a decade prior, and agree to forget about Daemon's criminal scheme as they thank one another for taking care of one another's sons, though Kōbei does ask that Daemon attempt to turn all five of the thieves away from their lives of crime.|$|E
500|$|In early 1932 she met George Smith, {{who lived}} {{across from the}} {{hospital}} where she worked, and to which he delivered milk every morning. Smith and his brother, Frank Smith, operated a dairy farm and a shop in Woolton {{that had been in}} the Smith family for four generations. Smith started courting Mimi, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. Stanley would only allow the couple to sit in the back room at Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting. After delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, [...] "or nothing at all!" ...|$|E

500|$|When {{other girls}} were {{thinking}} of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures. She once confided that she never wanted to get married, as she hated {{the idea of being}} [...] "tied to the kitchen sink". She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference. George Stanley (Mimi's father) would only allow the couple to sit in the back room of the family home in Newcastle Road when he or his wife were in the front room, and before it grew too late he would burst <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> and loudly order Smith home. The courtship lasted almost seven years, but Smith grew tired of waiting, so after delivering milk to the hospital one morning he gave her an ultimatum that she must marry him, [...] "or nothing at all!"

2500|$|Roma {{is furious}} at Williamson, who has blown a big sale. Levene picks up where Roma left off, and begins {{insulting}} Williamson. Mid-rant, Levene accidentally reveals his knowledge that Williamson {{made up the}} claim about the check being cashed, information {{he could not have}} known unless he had been in Williamson's office. Williamson accuses Levene of robbing the office. Levene quickly folds and admits that he and Dave Moss were the thieves. Levene tries to bribe Williamson, offering half of his future sales. Williamson reveals that the Nyborg sale is worthless, as the couple is elderly, mentally ill and just like talking to salesmen because they're so lonely. Levene asks why Williamson wants him turned in, and why he would give him the lead in the first place. Williamson simply states he doesn't like Levene, for the years of verbal abuse, and the old man's flippant nature. [...] Roma comes back from his interrogation and Williamson goes in the back room to speak with the detective. Alone with a devastated Levene, Roma proposes the two men work together. The door opens and the detective demands to speak with Levene, shoving him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Their new-found sound {{took them}} to the DM i Rock semifinals in 1992, where they were beaten by Passion Orange. With their third attempt on 30 April 1993, the trio won because of [...] "their obvious talent and charisma." [...] Part of the grand prize was a {{recording}} session for a 4-track demo at Sweet Silence Studios, which spawned the songs [...] "Waterline" [...] and [...] "Silverflame" [...] that became huge hits on DR P3 and DR P4. The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals. A reviewer from that time remarked, [...] "They are not quite as extroverted as one might have expected, but in return they play much better than one might dare hope for. Dense and energetic, making one wonder why there are only three men on stage. One is tempted to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>room</b> to see where the rest of the band is hiding." [...] They would also entertain with ironic covers of among others [...] "Stayin' Alive" [...] by the Bee Gees.|$|E
60|$|Madame {{led them}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> <b>into</b> which she {{sometimes}} invited the especially favoured of her customers.

60|$|The next day, Miss Mercy had {{hurried into}} No. 7, {{to declare that}} the ladies were all that was charming, but that their {{servants}} gave themselves airs beyond credence, especially the butler, who played the guitar, and insisted on a second table; {{when there was a}} peal of the bell, and Mary from her post of observation 'really believed it was Lady Conway herself;' whereupon Miss Mercy, without listening to persuasions, popped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> drawing <b>room</b> to effect her retreat.|$|R

"Mr. Prendergast {{is in the}} library, sir, if you please," [...] {{said the}} old servant; and so saying he ushered Herbert <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> down-stairs <b>room.</b> It was a spacious, lofty apartment, well fitted up for a library, and {{furnished}} for that purpose with exceeding care;--such a room as one does not find in the flashy new houses in the west, where the dining-room and drawing-room occupy all {{of the house that}} is visible. But then, how few of those who live in flashy new houses in the west require to have libraries in London! ...|$|R
60|$|No {{name was}} asked for, however, as Miss Dowson was shown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> untidy little <b>back</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> first floor, {{in which the}} sorceress ate, slept, and {{received}} visitors.

2500|$|On 4 June 2008, {{only one}} day before {{the launch of the}} series, Channel 4 {{released}} images of the luxury bedroom {{and for the first time}} before the launch show in the programme's history, the Diary Room.

This meant that the housemates had to exit the House through the main doorway to enter the Diary Room; however, the Diary Room button that the housemates used to notify Big Brother of their intent to go to the Diary Room was located next to the main door inside the House. Outside the bathroom were tokens, which housemates bought from the shopping list and gave to Big Brother if they wanted to use hot water or get rewards. The tokens were not returned afterwards. When the house was split into Heaven and Hell, the garden had to be modified, with a new outside bathroom in [...] "hell" [...] and the seating area in heaven was located as the smoking area.|$|R

[...] Whereupon Newton took up his hat and left the room. He had not passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> in which {{he knew that the}} servant would be looking for soda-water, before he heard a sound as of smashed crockery, and he was convinced that Mr. Neefit was preparing himself for forcible eviction by breaking his ornaments. Let the ornaments go, and the mirror, and the clock on the chimney-piece, and the windows. It was a frightful nuisance, but anything would be better than sending for the police to take away Mr. Neefit.

6000|$|The {{day before}} the night the two burglars had fixed upon for their enterprise, Captain Pierpoint himself {{appeared}} to be in unusual spirits. Pete Morris called in at the bank {{during the course of the}} morning, to reconnoitre the premises, under pretence of paying in a few dollars' worth of silver, and he found the Captain very lively indeed. When Pete handed him the silver across the counter, the Captain weighed it with a smile, gave a receipt for the amount--he always gave receipts as a matter of form--and actually invited Pete <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> which was at once kitchen, bedroom, and parlour, to have a drink. Then, before Pete's very eyes, he opened the safe, bursting with papers, and placed the silver in a bag on a shelf by itself, sticking <b>the</b> key <b>into</b> his waistcoat pocket. [...] "He is delivering himself up into our hands," [...] thought Pete to himself, as the Captain poured out two glasses of old Bourbon, and handed one to the miner opposite. [...] "Here's success to all our enterprises!" [...] cried the Captain gaily. [...] "Here's success, pard!" [...] Pete answered, with a sinister look, which even the Captain could not help noting in a sidelong fashion.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new solar shading system consisting of glass lamellas with a reflecting solar control coating. The coating is able to efficiently reduce the solar gain through building facades and at the same time redirect part of <b>the</b> daylight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where it is most needed. The shading system has been simulated using IESve/Radiance on daylight conditions for a single cell office. A full-scale model of the shad-ing system has also been tested in SBi’s Daylight Laboratory. Simulations and measurements on the shading system under overcast conditions show a reduction in the daylight factor (DF) close to the facade while the DF is unchanged or even higher in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> office. Under sunny sky conditions, the lamellas will normally be turned into a vertical position. In this po-sition, the reflective coating will contribute to reduce the heat load on the office significantly...|$|R
6000|$|They {{showed him}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bare little <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> {{and sent a}} boy up with a hastily written note to Ronald for the maps and papers.

By two o'clock, the proofs had all come up to him, and he took his hat in a shamefaced manner to sally out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cold street, where he hoped to hide his rising remorse and agony under cover of the solitary night. He knew too well what 'the policy of the paper' would be, to venture upon asking any questions about it. As he left the office, a boy brought him down a sealed envelope from Mr. Lancaster. With his usual kindly thoughtfulness the editor had sent him at once the customary cheque for three guineas. Ernest folded it up with quivering fingers, and felt the blood burn in his cheeks as he put it away in his waistcoat pocket. That accursed money! For it he had that night sold his dearest principles! And yet, not for it, not for it, not for it--oh, no, not for it, but for Dot and Edie! ...|$|R
6000|$|A few mourners {{had stolen}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> house and up <b>the</b> threadbare stairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> miserable little <b>back</b> <b>room,</b> somehow dignified {{as it had}} never been before, and laid their gifts upon the coffin. An odd and pitiful {{assortment}} they were--mourners and gifts: men and women whose only bond with the man in life had been the bond of misery; who had seen him as he had fared forth morning after morning in the hopeless search for work, and slunk home night after night bitter and dejected; many of whom had listened, jeeringly perhaps, to his grievance against the world, though it were in some sort their own. Death, for them, had ennobled him. The little girl whom Hodder had met with the pitcher of beer came tiptoeing with a wilted bunch of pansies, picked heaven knows where; stolen, maybe, from one of the gardens of the West End. Carnations, lilies of the valley, geraniums even--such were the offerings scattered loosely on the lid until a woman came with a mass of white roses that filled the room with their fragrance,--a woman with burnished red hair. Hodder started as he recognized her; her gaze was a strange mixture of effrontery and--something else; sorrow did not quite express it. The very lavishness of her gift brought to him irresistibly the reminder of another offering. .... She was speaking.|$|R
