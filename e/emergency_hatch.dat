2500|$|The commissioners {{strongly}} recommended safety improvements, {{starting with}} easy access to <b>emergency</b> <b>hatches.</b> Balloons of the late 1930s were equipped with large parachutes capable of safely carrying the detached gondolas; another proposal, integrating airtight gondolas into detachable gliders, was tested and discarded. VR60 Komsomol (1939) [...] had another safety feature: in case of abnormally rapid descent its balloon was designed to flatten into a gigantic parachute canopy.|$|R
50|$|The crew then {{contacted}} Marsa Brega Tower {{and asked}} for an emergency landing. The Captain asked the First Officer to restart the engine. As they prepared for an emergency landing (ditching), multiple warnings sounded in the cockpit. The Captain then ordered the First Officer to open the <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch.</b> The ATC asked the crew to confirm the emergency. As the First Officer confirmed the emergency, the aircraft impacted water.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{executives}} from every studio and camera crews crowd a cargo plane soaring over the jungle, {{as they prepare}} to parachute the chimp into an unexplored section of the Amazon; but before arriving at the intended disembarkation point, the stubborn chimpanzee, {{not wanting to be}} sent into the wild, pulls a lever opening an <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> which sucks all the executives out of the plane, causing them to parachute into the jungle instead. Albert Mertons, who is now more sympathetic to Jennifer's feelings, reveals to Steven that the chimp outsmarted the executives and is now en route back to the United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{exit from}} the bunker was through a 366 m long tunnel, in reality a large air duct, that opened to the outside at the {{perimeter}} of the pad. In the event that this route was blocked, there was an <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatch</b> in the roof of the dome.|$|R

50|$|The driver sits in {{the center}} of the front of the hull and has three vision blocks and {{periscopes}} located at the top of the sloping glacis plate. During night operations the center periscope is switched for the TVN-28 night vision device, which gives the driver a clear vision up to 60 meters. The driver also has a small hatch that opens upwards and, while it can't be used for the driver to leave the vehicle, it can be opened in relatively safe areas for extra vision. When in combat the hatch is closed and the driver can use a vision block for a limited vision. Under the driver's seat is an <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> which can be used by all crew members.|$|E
50|$|To begin, {{participants}} will usually go {{into such a}} building early in the morning, before too many people arrive to use the elevators, or late at night, {{when most of the}} building's occupants have left. Entry into the elevator shaft is usually achieved by using a special key to open the outer doors or, if the key cannot be accessed, by lock picking. Alternatively, participants may force the elevator car's doors open between floors and unlatch the outer doors from the inside. A common misconception is that the <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> in the roof of the elevator can be opened from inside of the elevator car. However, this is rarely the case, and these are, instead, designed for the use of emergency crews to rescue trapped passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{is completely}} water-tight {{allowing it to}} self-right with up to 60 people on board. The boat {{has the potential to}} carry a maximum of 120 passengers on board, but without self-righting capability. The Survivors Space has room for 10 sitting and 8 standing. The Survivors Space is accessed either through the Wheelhouse or the fore deck <b>Emergency</b> Escape <b>Hatch.</b>|$|R
50|$|If the {{emergency}} affects the entire train, then guests are evacuated {{to the surface}} of the beam. Guests again open the <b>emergency</b> roof <b>hatches,</b> but do not simply move to the adjacent car. Instead, they use a small handrail present along the top of each train car to move all the way to the front of the train. The Disneyland Fire Department assists in the safe evacuation of the disabled train.|$|R
50|$|The Kabine had a steel unit body. Access to the {{interior}} was by an opening front. In order not to infringe Iso Rivolta's patent used on the Isetta, the steering wheel did not hinge outwards with the door to ease passenger access. However, it did feature a reverse gear, unlike some other bubble cars. The fabric sun roof served as an <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatch</b> should the sole door in front become jammed in a collision.|$|R
50|$|The ISU-152 had {{different}} versions, {{with changes in}} the gun (later versions), the number of hatches, or the hull (based on the hull of the IS-1, IS-2 or IS-2 model 1944 tanks). The IS-2 based versions had a thicker gun shield and larger fuel tank. Until May 1944, the main armament was the 152.4 mm ML-20 model 1937 gun-howitzer. The ISU-152 had a rate of fire of 2-3 rounds/min. The early versions had three hatches in the superstructure roof and one <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> {{at the bottom of}} the hull behind the driver's seat, which had an armored cover. Later versions had a fourth, round hatch in the superstructure roof on the right, next to the rectangular hatch on the left.|$|E
5000|$|The crew {{disguise}} Fury {{so that it}} {{will appear}} knocked out, and then wait inside for the approaching Germans. They share a bottle of whiskey, and Norman is finally accepted by the crew and given his nickname: [...] "Machine". When the Germans arrive, the crew ambush them using both the tank's and their own personal weapons. As ammunition runs out and the battle turns desperate, Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust round penetrating the turret; Gordo is wounded and then sacrifices himself by covering one of his dropped grenades; then a sniper kills Bible and severely wounds Don. Don orders Norman to escape through the <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> in the floor, as the Germans drop grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just as they explode, killing Don. Norman tries to hide as the Germans move on, but is discovered by a young SS soldier, who hesitates and then leaves without reporting him.|$|E
5000|$|Starting at the nose, {{the bomb}} aimer had two {{positions}} to man. His primary location was lying prone {{on the floor}} of the nose of the aircraft, with access to the bombsight controls facing forward, with the bombsight computer on his left and bomb release selectors on the right. He also used his view out of the large transparent perspex nose cupola to assist the navigator with map reading. To man the Frazer Nash FN5 nose turret, he stood up placing himself in position behind the triggers of the twin [...]303 in (7.7 mm) guns. Ammunition for the turret was 1,000 rounds per gun (rpg). The bomb aimer's position contained the nose <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> in the floor; at 22 inches by 26.5 inches (two inches narrower than the Halifax escape hatch) it was difficult to exit through while wearing a parachute. Operational research experts, including British scientist Freeman Dyson, amongst others, attempted unsuccessfully to have the escape hatch enlarged.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{aerodynamic}} {{design has}} been modified {{based on the}} test flights completed {{and the use of}} computer models with the aim of increasing performance. Changes include altering the engine thrust angle, which has made a large improvement. On the final production aircraft the right side door has been eliminated to save weight. The door will be replaced by an <b>emergency</b> egress <b>hatch.</b> The production aircraft will also have a more pointed nose, larger belly section, redesigned wing-root fairing, reduced tail sweep and a larger or even dual ventral fin.|$|R
5000|$|The Block II used a one-piece, quick-release, outward opening hatch {{instead of}} the two-piece plug hatch used on Block I, in which the inner piece had to be unbolted and placed inside the cabin in order to enter or exit the {{spacecraft}} (a flaw that doomed the Apollo 1 crew). The Block II hatch could be opened quickly {{in case of an}} <b>emergency.</b> (Both <b>hatch</b> versions were covered with an extra, removable section of the Boost Protective Cover which surrounded the CM to protect it in case of a launch abort.) ...|$|R
50|$|If the {{emergency}} affects the entire train, then guests are evacuated {{to the surface}} of the beam.

50|$|Like the PT-76, the BTR-50 has a flat, boat-shaped hull. Unlike the PT-76, {{it has a}} new {{superstructure}} {{added to}} the front of the vehicle. The hull of the BTR-50 is made of all-welded steel with the crew compartment in the front, the troop compartment in the center and the engine compartment at the rear. It has the ability to transport up to 20 fully equipped infantrymen, who sit on benches that run across the full width of the troop compartment. They mount and dismount the APC by climbing over the sides of the hull. The driver sits in the center of the front of the hull and has three vision blocks and periscopes located at the top of the sloping glacis plate. During night operations, the center periscope can be swapped for the TVN-28 night vision device, which gives the driver clear vision up to 60 meters. The driver also has a small hatch that opens upwards—while it cannot be used to leave the vehicle, it can be opened in relatively safe areas for extra vision. In combat, the hatch is closed and the driver can use a vision block. There is an <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> under the driver's seat. The commander, who sits on the left side of the vehicle at the front, has three vision blocks and periscopes in a projecting bay. On top of this bay is a cupola that opens forward and can be locked vertically; it has a vision block facing forward. The vehicle can operate in temperatures from −40 °C to +40 °C.|$|E
50|$|This was a {{prototype}} tank developed in 1945. It used {{elements of both}} the IS-2 and IS-3 tanks. The overall height of the vehicle was reduced to 2240 mm, which was compensated with an increased width of the superstructure. The factory designation was Object 704 (Объект 704). It was armed with the 152.4 mm ML-20SM model 1944 (МЛ-20СМ обр. 1944 г.) gun-howitzer, with a barrel length of over 4.5 metres (29.6 calibers) and no muzzle brake. It had a maximum range of 13,000 metres. The self-propelled gun carried 20 rounds of two piece (shell and charge) armour-piercing and high explosive ammunition. The armour-piercing round, weighing 48.78 kg, had a muzzle velocity of 655 m/s. The rate of fire was 1-2 round/min. Object 704 had four hatches at the superstructure roof and one <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> {{at the bottom of}} the hull behind the driver's seat, which had an armoured cover. The self-propelled gun carried two external fuel tanks (90 litres each), not connected to the supply system. The secondary armament of the fighting vehicle consisted of two 12.7 x 108 mm DShK machine guns, one anti-aircraft and one co-axial. The protection was increased by placing thicker armour at more radical angles. In the area of the gun, where the mantlet combined with the hull front behind it and the housing of the recoil mechanism, the armour thickness was 320 mm. Object 704 (ИСУ-152 обр. 1945 г.) was the best protected of all experimental or production Soviet self-propelled guns of the Second World War. However, the radical incline of the superstructure walls combined with the increased recoil of the gun, due to the lack of a muzzle brake, significantly complicated the work of the crew, and for this reason it wasn't adopted.|$|E

Duties assigned to the Manager of the Fire, Crash and Rescue division of the Space Shuttle Program are discussed, including training of both ground and flight personnel {{in accordance with the}} Orbiter Crash Rescue Information manual. The special problem of providing a means of egress and rescue for the flight and ground crews of the Orbiter while it is in the piggyback configuration on top the Boeing 747 carrier was solved by use of a modified 85 -foot articulated boom...|$|R
50|$|The Valentine was of {{conventional}} layout, divided internally into three compartments; {{from front to}} back the driver's position, the fighting compartment with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets. The driver's area contained only the driver and the driving controls. The driver sat on hull centre line, entering through either of two angled hatches over the seat, though there was an <b>emergency</b> exit <b>hatch</b> beneath his seat. The driver had a direct vision port—cut in what was one of the hull's cross members—in front of him and two periscopes in the roof over his head. Driving was by clutch and brake steering through levers, whose control rods ran the length of the hull to the transmission at the rear.|$|R
50|$|It was {{powered by}} a , {{eighteen}} cylinder Salmson 18 Cm. This {{was one of the}} last, and the most powerful, of Salmson's water-cooled radial engines, with two in-line rows of nine cylinders. It was enclosed in a rounded cowling with caps over the cylinder-heads. Fuel was held in the wing centre-section and two Lamblin radiators were mounted on the undercarriage legs. Behind the engine the fuselage was rectangular in section, defined by light-metal, U-section longerons and cross-frames. The open cockpit was at the wing leading edge, with small side-windows for a better view downwards. Behind the cockpit the cabin seated six passengers, each with their own window. Entry was via a port-side door and there was a disposable <b>emergency</b> ceiling <b>hatch</b> to allow passengers to escape by parachute.|$|R
5000|$|IRM [...] "Zhuk" [...] (IRM {{stands for}} inzhenernaya razvedyvatel'naya mashina - {{engineer}} reconnaissance vehicle, [...] "Zhuk" [...] means Beetle) - All-terrain combat engineer vehicle for land and river reconnaissance, {{developed in the}} 1970s. Production started in 1980 {{with the use of}} components from both the BMP-1 and BMP-2. Fifty IRMs were produced from 1986. However, the suspension had a new hull, one extra road wheel and one additional hydraulic shock-absorber. It has four pressurized compartments, with the engine located at the rear. There are three hatches {{on the top of the}} hull and one <b>emergency</b> <b>hatch</b> in the bottom. The IRM is equipped with two retractable propellers in ring covers for swimming and steering and two cases with 16 9M39 solid engines (each has a thrust of 312 kg and weighs 6.3 kg), for getting out of mud. Special reconnaissance equipment consists of two R-147 radios; one PIR-451 periscope; TNPO-160, TNP-370 and TNV-25M periscopic observation devices; an AGI-1s horizon indicator; a DSP-30 portable periscopic rangefinder, a PAB-2M portable aiming circle, one TNA-3 gyroscopic navigational device, an EIR echo depth finder with automatic recorder and three sonar transducers, a RShM-2 river-type wide-span mine detector, RVM-2M and IMP-2 portable mine detectors, a PR-1 portable penetrometer used to analyze soil for crossability and an ice drill with ice stake. The vehicle has two arms for detecting metallic mines which are mounted on the front of the hull. They can be retracted when not in use. The mine detector arms can be hydraulically articulated to their operating position in under three minutes. The mine detector brings the vehicle to a full stop upon encountering an obstacle or detecting a metallic object. The PIR-451 periscope is mounted on the right hand side of the front of the vehicle, at the commander's station. It can be extended to 1.5 m and can move vertically up to 750 mm. The IRM also has an air revitalization system, automatic fire extinguishers, a water pump with a capacity of 1,000 l/min, an automatic NBC protection system and an engine thermal smoke generator. It weighs 17.2 tonnes and has a crew of six. It is 8.22 m long, 3.15 m wide and 2.40 m high. Ground clearance is 420 mm. It has a maximum road speed of 52 km/h and it can swim at up to 12 km/h. It is armed with a PKT machine gun fitted in a small turret for which it carries 1,000 rounds. In the west, the IRM was believed to be based on the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer until 1986 when its true origins became known.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatches</b> {{of refuge}} cabin are usually {{installed}} in {{both sides of}} the life supporting compartment, which might cause the toxic gases or water enter into life supporting compartment when the gas explosion and water inrush accident occur. A new type of refuge cabin structure that can effectively resist the toxic gases and water entering the life supporting compartment is developed in this paper. Numerical simulation of antiknock impact performance of the new refuge cabin was calculated and analyzed by using the finite element software of LS-DYNA. The stress and strain distributions and maximum antiknock performance were obtained. Refuge chamber cabin has been optimized to reduce cost. The antiknock impact performance of optimized mine refuge chamber cabin can reach 1. 4 MPa which is greater than the 0. 6 MPa of standard value and the cost can be reduced approximate 19 % than the original model...|$|R
5000|$|In yacht sailing, multihulls {{are deemed}} to be more prone to turtling than keeled monohulls, and there is {{essentially}} no way to right them if they overturn. The juxtaposition of the hulls and sail when turtled [...] it makes them inherently stable when inverted [...] makes them especially resistant to righting. [...] Consequently, some larger multihulls are built with a turtle <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatch</b> beneath the hull. Indeed, some locales require such safety hatches. [...] There are, however, those who feel that {{the likelihood of a}} capsize of a large multihull is overrated. [...] There are others who state that a self-righting multihull is the answer, along with designing in safety and proper operation. [...] A patent has been issued specifically concerning righting of turtled large multihulls. [...] It is intended to avoid the necessity to use divers and special equipment in a recovery.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevator}} {{continues to}} move up, but gets {{stuck on the}} eleventh floor, with only minutes left before {{the final phase of}} the curse comes into effect. Sally explains that the big party in the 12th-floor club was a surprise birthday party for Abigail. Sally apologizes to Abigail {{for not being able to}} get to the party. Sally has kept the present she wanted to give to Abby: a golden bracelet with two hearts engraved with their names. Abby, Buzzy, Q, Jill and Sally board the service elevator, catching up with the others on the eleventh floor. Anna manages to escape from an <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatch,</b> rejoining Buzzy and the others in their elevator. At exactly 8:05pm, lightning strikes the hotel again, as happened in 1939, and both elevators plummet downwards. Amidst the chaos, Sally forgives her sister, and as they lovingly hold hands, they both dissolve into a shower of golden sparkles, breaking the curse and safely stopping both elevators just as they were about to crash.|$|R
50|$|The {{hull of the}} M41 is of {{welded steel}} construction, with the driving {{compartment}} located {{at the front of}} the tank and to the left. This may be accessed through the hull by a single piece hatch cover opening to the right. When the hatch is closed, the tank is navigated by three driving periscopes mounted forward of the driver's position and one to the left. There is no night vision equipment fitted as standard, although in some models an infrared searchlight could be mounted externally on the turret or the day periscopes replaced with new infrared periscopes. An <b>emergency</b> escape <b>hatch</b> is situated beneath the driver's seat. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the hull and is insulated from the crew by a fireproof bulkhead. The Allison Cross-Drive Model CD-500-3 transmission is located within this compartment, immediately behind the engine, and includes one forward and one reverse gear ratios. All M41 tanks utilize a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the rear and idler towards the front, and three track return rollers. The first, second, and fifth road wheel stations have hydraulic shock absorbers. Although the M41 is not considered amphibious, it was designed for fording up to 1.016 meters of water without preparation, and up to 2.44 meters of water with preparation. The hull is fitted with electric bilge pumps accordingly.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressurised}} fuselage {{was designed}} to accommodate two pilots and six passengers. Various interiors were offered for the aircraft, the standard interior offered {{a high degree of}} comfort to the passengers. In an executive configuration, the flight deck is separated from the main passenger cabin; the single entrance of the aircraft, located directly behind the cockpit and forward of the passenger cabin, forms a vestibule area in which luggage can be stored and meals prepared during flight. An unobstructed cabin floor with 5 ft 9in of headroom and a 3 ft wide cabin door also allowed the loading of bulky equipment, which was seen as particularly attractive to military operators. In addition to the entrance door, an <b>emergency</b> overwing exit <b>hatch</b> is also located in the passenger cabin midsection over the starboard wing (some versions have both port and starboard exits). The rear of the fuselage is occupied by a large equipment bay and, on some aircraft, two additional fuel tanks for extended operations.|$|R
