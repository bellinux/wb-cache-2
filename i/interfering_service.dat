At 72nd Street, this would have allowed trains from the Broadway Line to reverse without <b>interfering</b> with <b>service</b> on Second Avenue, as well as provided additional operational flexibility {{that could be used for}} construction work and non-revenue moves.

40|$|Abstract. Forging IP source {{addresses}} (spoofing) is {{a common}} technique to conceal the origin of a network level attack in today’s best effort IP networks. In the future, IP spoofing may also directly <b>interfere</b> with <b>service</b> agreements used in quality of service (QoS) enabled IP networks because policing mechanisms located in the core cannot distinguish between malicious and benevolent packets. This reduces the reliability of real-time data delivery services offered by future multiservice networks. However, without true origin authentication at the network layer, usually access networks only can detect IP spoofing reliably, by using additional trust-by-wire information. We extend this concept to the core network by proposing a mechanism that prevents packets that have been spoofed from entering reserved paths. This reduces the probability of successful DoS attacks on guaranteed QoS in IP networks, and is a good protective measure applicable for critical IP network infrastructures...|$|R

30|$|Theoretically, two {{orthogonal}} polarized {{waves are}} completely isolated, {{which means that}} an antenna can be configured with two receiving or sending ports, each of which matches only one polarized wave and is orthogonal to the other. In satellite communication systems, {{it is useful to}} use the characteristics of orthogonally polarized waves as additional isolation when transmitting and receiving in adjacent channels. However, due to the error of the actual transceiver equipment and the depolarization of the rain during the propagation of the radio wave, the polarization direction of the radio waves at the receiving end has generated errors, which will lead to two results: (1) the useful signals transmitted by the positive polarization mode will leak in the cross polarization direction and form interference to the cross polarization, and (2) the useful signals received in the direction of positive polarization will be weakened due to the error. The polarization isolation index does not meet the standard, which not only causes the transmission signal polarization attenuation in the positive polarization direction but also causes the leakage signal in the direction of reverse polarization to <b>interfere</b> the <b>service</b> on the frequency band, thereby affecting the quality of the receiving service.|$|R
