As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low <b>friction</b> <b>coefficient,</b> as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity.

25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick and slip, modelled as a drop of <b>friction</b> <b>coefficient</b> with velocity.|$|E

Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object.

Therefore, several methods to evaluate friction have been proposed. However those methods are not well simulated for the severe conditions occurring in actual forging processes. In this study, a new method to evaluate <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> is proposed. The method applies backward extrusion, which enables us to create high pressure, large surface area expansion and a long sliding distance, for the measurements. The unique feature of the die set used in this method is a rotating punch at a very slow angular velocity. By a combination of measured load and torque, <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> can be monitored throughout the measurement process. <b>Friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> were measured for four types of lubrications; mineral oil, cold forging oil, bonderizing and dry-in-place.

The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a <b>friction</b> <b>coefficient</b> μ and interfacial pressure P, or sticking friction, based on the interfacial shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate.

40|$|AbstractDynamic rope brakes are {{integral}} {{elements of the}} standard belaying equipment. They multiply the hand force of the belayer and convert {{a fraction of the}} falling climber’s kinetic energy into thermal energy. As the rope is deflected by the brake, the thermal energy is produced by belt friction. This paper introduces a brake model based on static and viscous belt friction. The contact angles of three different brakes (figure-of-eight, ATC and HMS [Munter hitch]) were determined. These data as well as data taken and/or derived from the literature served as input for the model. The static and viscous belt <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> range between 0. 2 – 0. 3 and 0. 015 – 0. 04, respectively, for the three brakes. Depending on the magnitude of the <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients,</b> three conditions can be distinguished: (1) no rope slip at high friction; (2) rope slip and stop; (3) critical braking; and (4) continuous rope slip (no stop). The window of the <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> between no slip and critical braking is independent of the hand force. However, the smaller the hand force is, the larger are the <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> at no slip and critical braking. Belayers with smaller hand forces should therefore avoid rope brakes with small static and viscous <b>friction</b> <b>coefficients</b> (like the Figure-ofEight) and apply the ATC or HMS...|$|R

The effects of shape, content {{and size of}} the copper powders on the tribological properties of the PTFE composites were discussed.
