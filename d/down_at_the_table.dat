5|$|We tried {{a similar}} {{approach}} for The Little Shop of Horrors, dropping {{in and out of}} various downtown dives. We ended up at a place where Sally Kellerman (before she became a star) was working as a waitress, and as Chuck and I vied with each other, trying to top each other’s sardonic or subversive ideas, appealing to Sally as a referee, she sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with us, and the three of us worked {{out the rest of the}} story together.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the table}} is served, it is strewn with {{a thin layer of}} straw and covered with a white cloth. The family members sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Prior to tucking in, they all rise and a man or boy among them says a prayer, or they {{together}} sing the Troparion of the Nativity in Church Slavonic language: ...|$|E
2500|$|As Wright philosophized of {{this period}} some thirty years later, 'Having a witness among the poor and having a {{ministry}} to the poor is one thing, but making the poor folks members of your congregation is something else altogether." [...] Wright further explained, [...] "Failure to have the black poor {{at the table with}} you as equals means you are doing missionary work," [...] while having [...] "poor black folks" [...] who [...] "sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> as equals" [...] means you are [...] "serious about talking or doing [...] black theology." [...] As Speller explains, Trinity's congregants [...] "began to slowly move away from the concept of church as a place to enhance and validate their social position to one that appreciated the church as a place for spiritual formation." [...] In sum, Trinity began to more fully move away from its earlier purpose surrounding [...] "middle-classness" [...] to one where devotion to God and the poor took much greater prominence.|$|E

2500|$|Christmas {{dinner is}} the most celebratory meal a family has during a year. Аbout noon, or even earlier, the family members sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> When the head of {{household}} gives a sign, all rise. He lights a candle, censes his family and house, and prays the Lord's Prayer. After that, the family members kiss {{each other on the}} cheek saying, [...] "The peace of God among us, Christ is Born." [...] The head and another man of the family hold the česnica between themselves, rotating it three times counterclockwise. The česnica is then carefully broken among the relatives, so that each of them gets his or her own share of the loaf. The family member whose share contains the coin hidden in the česnica, will supposedly be exceptionally lucky in the coming year. The main course of Christmas dinner is roast pork of the pečenica. During the dinner, the head of household proposes a toast to his family with a glass of wine, several times. A traditional toast from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina goes like this: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{stranger}} was Mr. Fagin. And {{very amiable}} he looked, {{and a very}} low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nearest <b>table,</b> ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.|$|R

60|$|IT {{was nearly}} an hour past noon when Mr. Pendril left the house. Miss Garth sat <b>down</b> again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> alone, and tried to face the {{necessity}} which the event of the morning now forced on her.|$|R
60|$|Peters and Crosby {{entered a}} large music hall and sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|R

60|$|There {{was a loud}} buzz of conversation, and Philip listened attentively to {{that between}} four gentlemen who had just sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next <b>table</b> to him.

60|$|Aaron sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He ate {{and drank}} ravenously. He was, in fact, half starved but barely {{conscious}} of it.|$|E

60|$|Tavernake {{looked at}} him in a puzzled way. The {{professor}} was a riddle to him. He represented no type which had come within the orbit of his experience. With the arrival of the champagne, the professor became almost eloquent. He leaned forward, gazing stealthily <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> round <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|Haffigan sits <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writing <b>table,</b> {{with his}} back to the filing cabinet. Broadbent sits {{opposite}} him.
