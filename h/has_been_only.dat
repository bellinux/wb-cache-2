Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
5|$|The lyricism in Delius's early {{compositions}} {{reflected the}} music {{he had heard}} in America and the influences of European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius's music <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} {{axis of the}} Moon lies within Shackleton, only a few kilometers from its center. The crater is 21km in diameter and 4.2km deep. From the Earth, it is viewed edge-on in a region of rough, cratered terrain. It is located within the South Pole-Aitken basin on a massif. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> lightly impacted. No significant craters intersect the rim, and it is sloped about 1.5° toward the direction 50–90° from the Earth. The age of the crater is about 3.6billion years {{and it has been}} in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{during the}} month of March are an unusual {{occurrence}} in Minnesota when compared {{to the rest of the}} spring and summer months. Before this event there had been only six tornadoes ever recorded in the state during March, and since this event there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> six. This outbreak also marks the first time in Minnesota history that two tornadoes were recorded on the same day in March, as well as the first time since 1921 that there have been multiple tornado fatalities on the same March day. Despite the historical significance of the outbreak, this was not the earliest calendar-year tornado to touch down in Minnesota; that record is held by three tornadoes that touched on March 6, 2017.|$|E

25|$|In Nepal, the {{incidence}} of man-eating tigers <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> sporadic. In Chitwan National Park no cases were recorded before 1980. In the following few years, 13 {{people have been killed}} and eaten in the park and its environs. In the majority of cases, man-eating appeared to have been related to an intra-specific competition among male tigers.|$|E

Among those are Strikeforce, Bellator Fighting Championships, the all female Invicta Fighting Championships, and the now defunct EliteXC.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{of the complex}} pathways of metabolic syndrome are under investigation. The pathophysiology is very complex and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>only</b> partially elucidated. Most patients are older, obese, sedentary, and have a degree of insulin resistance. Stress {{can also be a}} contributing factor. The most important risk factors are diet (particularly sugar-sweetened beverage consumption), genetics, aging, sedentary behavior or low physical activity, disrupted chronobiology/sleep, mood disorders/psychotropic medication use, and excessive alcohol use.|$|E
