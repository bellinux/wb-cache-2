Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E

5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series.

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th {{century the}} Dominican Order had been tasked with the {{peaceful}} {{conversion of the}} Ch'ol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under {{the administration of the}} governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.|$|E

The property was purchased by the National Trust in 1946, and some restoration work was conducted in 1967. The complex of buildings was scheduled as an ancient monument in May 1951, and the former chantry house was listed as a Grade I building in April 1961. At the same time, the other buildings on site were listed as Grade II buildings: the gateway and wall, three barns (one of which is ruined), a ruined outbuilding and a dovecote.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of Israel, Halmich's last {{opponent}} before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match {{turned into a}} brawl and Finer scored {{during the first half}} of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On December 5, 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring in most of the rounds. The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian. In December 2008, she was named Germany's female boxer of the year for the first time.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E

5|$|Roman baths {{played a}} leading role in the {{development}} of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. These domes are very conical in shape, similar to those on an Assyrian bas-relief found in Nineveh. At a Roman era tepidarium in Cabrera de Mar, Spain, a dome has been identified <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd century BC that used a refined version of the parallel arch construction found in an earlier Hellenistic bath dome in Sicily. According to Vitruvius, the temperature and humidity of domed warm rooms could be regulated by raising or lowering bronze discs located under an oculus. Domes were particularly well suited to the hot rooms of baths circular in plan to facilitate even heating from the walls. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources for}} Áedán's life include Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Irish annals, principally the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach; and Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba. The Senchus fer n-Alban, a census and {{genealogy}} of Dál Riata, purports to record his ancestry {{and that of}} his immediate descendants. None of these sources are contemporary. Adomnán's work was written in the very late 7th century, probably to mark the centenary of Columba's death. It incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of Columba, De virtutibus sancti Columbae, by Cumméne Find. This may have been written as early as 640; neither the elements incorporated from Cumméne's work nor Adomnán's own writings can be treated as simple history. Bede's history was written 30 years after Adomnán's. The surviving Irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at Iona <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th century onwards, so that these too are retrospective when dealing with Áedán's time.|$|E
5|$|The tooth is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per millimeter (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E

5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late Cretaceous India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} Cretaceous. It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, but not with the South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms are united in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines except Holochilus and {{its close}} relatives, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps {{extending}} {{higher than the}} central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong cusps and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The cusps of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) cusps are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first molar, one accessory ridge, the anteroloph, is lacking, but another, the mesoloph, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the molar, the mesolophs of Pseudoryzomys are short and protrude only slightly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molar. The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the mesolophid, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between cusps on the lower first molar, the posteroflexid, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in Lundomys and Holochilus. A number of molar traits support Pseudoryzomyss relationship with Holochilus and Lundomys, forming steps in {{the transition from the}} complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine molar pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of Holochilus.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{extinction}} of the professional poet, {{the integration of the}} native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities when they returned to Wales. While in 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh, from Greek and Hebrew. From the 16th century onwards the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. Initially the eisteddfod was askance with the religious denominations, but in time these bodies came to dominate the competitions, with the bardic themes becoming increasingly scriptural and didactic. The period is notable for the adoption by Welsh poets of bardic names, made popular by the eisteddfod movement.|$|E
