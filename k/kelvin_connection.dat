50|$|The <b>Kelvin</b> <b>connection</b> {{is based}} upon the highly {{productive}} professional relationship between William Thomson (later-Lord Kelvin) (1824-1907), Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University from 1846-1899 and James White (1824-1884), a Glasgow-based Optical Instrument Maker. White's association with Thomson lasted until he died, but without any legal deeds of co-partnership White bore the financial risks of their working partnership.|$|E
50|$|Four-terminal sensing is {{also known}} as Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low {{resistances}} using four-terminal sensing. Each two-wire connection can be called a <b>Kelvin</b> <b>connection.</b> A pair of contacts that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a Kelvin contact. A clip, often a crocodile clip, that connects a force-and-sense pair is called a Kelvin clip.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} instruments {{use other}} {{techniques such as}} inserting the capacitor-under-test into a bridge circuit. By varying {{the values of the}} other legs in the bridge (so as to bring the bridge into balance), the value of the unknown capacitor is determined. This method of indirect use of measuring capacitance ensures greater precision. The bridge usually can also measure series resistance and inductance. Through the use of <b>Kelvin</b> <b>connections</b> and other careful design techniques, these instruments can usually measure capacitors over a range from picofarads to farads. Combined LCR meters that can measure inductance, resistance, and capacitance are available.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Fort Breda, County Down in Ireland, on 10 January 1845, the son of William Bottomley JP, a {{merchant}} in nearby Belfast. His mother, Anna Thomson, was the sister of William Thomson, Lord <b>Kelvin,</b> a <b>connection</b> which served him well throughout his life.|$|R
40|$|Almost all {{low noise}} voltage {{preamplifier}} suitable for application {{in the field}} of Low Frequency Noise Measurements (either commercially available or proposed in the literature) are single ended input amplifiers. This means that one end of the measuring port of the Device Under Test (DUT) must be connected to common ground. This may be a severe limitation in many interesting measurement configurations, such as the case in which <b>Kelvin</b> <b>connections</b> to the DUT must be employed. In this paper we propose a simple design of a fully differential input ultra low noise amplifier with noise performances, in term of equivalent input voltage noise, comparable to those of the best single ended input amplifiers for low frequency noise measurements reported in the literature. Indeed, the amplifier we propose is characterized by a voltage gain of 80 dB, in the bandwidth from a few tens of mHz up to a few kHz, and by an equivalent input voltage noise as low as 14 nV/√Hz (100 mHz), 2 nV/√Hz (1 Hz), 1. 2 nV/√Hz (10 Hz) and 1 nV/√Hz (1 kHz). Such an amplifier can also be employed as a single ended input amplifier by simply shorting to ground one of the two differential input ports...|$|R
50|$|When a <b>Kelvin</b> <b>connection</b> is used, {{current is}} {{supplied}} via {{a pair of}} source connections (current leads). These generate a voltage drop across the impedance to be measured according to Ohm's law V=IR. A pair of sense connections (voltage leads) are made immediately adjacent to the target impedance, {{so that they do}} not include the voltage drop in the force leads or contacts. Since almost no current flows to the measuring instrument, the voltage drop in the sense leads is negligible.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} amplifier for atmospheric {{fine wire}} resistance thermometry is described. The amplifier uses a low excitation current (50 mu A). This {{is shown to}} ensure negligible self-heating of the low mass fine wire resistance sensor, compared with measured nocturnal surface air temperature fluctuations. The system provides sufficient amplification for a +/- 50 degrees C span using a +/- 5 V dynamic range analog-to-digital converter, with a noise level of less than 0. 01 degrees C. A <b>Kelvin</b> four-wire <b>connection</b> cancels the effect of long lead resistances: a 50 m length of screened cable connecting the Reading design of fine wire thermometer to the amplifier produced no measurable temperature change at 12 bit resolution...|$|R
50|$|Bobo and Ming also coincidentally work at {{the same}} news press. The two do not get along at first since Ming is Bobo's nemesis, but the two {{eventually}} become friends because of their shared hatred for her nemesis and work rival. Ming also eventually {{falls in love with}} Bobo after getting close to her but when she gets fired from her job, <b>Kelvin</b> uses his <b>connections</b> to try to get her another job. Seeing Kelvin scramble for her she falls in love with him and confesses her feelings. Kelvin, seeing Ken and Tracy resume their relationship he accepts Bobo's love confession and the two start dating. Ming who does is heartbroken but does not want to interfere on Kelvin and Bobo's new found relationship keeps his feelings for Bobo quiet. However Polly who has a crush on Ming starts hanging around him, but Ming makes it clear that he is not interested in her.|$|R
40|$|As {{continued}} scaling {{becomes increasingly}} difficult, 3 D integration {{has emerged as}} a viable solution to achieve higher bandwidth and power efficiency. Through-siliconvias (TSVs), which directly connect stacked structures die-to-die, {{is one of the key}} techniques enabling 3 D integration. The process steps and physical presence of TSVs, however, may generate a stress-induced thermal mismatch between TSVs and the silicon bulk. These effects could further perturb the performance of nearby electronic structures, particularly transistors, diodes, and associated circuits. This thesis presents a comprehensive study to characterize, analyze and model the impact of TSV-induced stress impact on device and circuit performance and its interaction with polysilicon and shallow-trench-isolation (STI) layout pattern density. A test chip is designed with multiplexing test circuits providing measurements of key parameters of a large number of devices. These devices under test (DUTs) have layouts that explore a range of TSV and device layout choices in the design of experiments (DOEs). The test chip uses a scan chain approach combined with low-leakage and low-variation switches and <b>Kelvin</b> sensing <b>connections,</b> which provide access to detailed analog device characteristics in large arrays of test devices. A test circuit and an Ioff measurement method is designed to perform off-chip wafer probe testing measurement. In addition, a finite element analysis model is constructed to mimic realistic TSV structures and processes. A complete flow and methodology to analyze transistor characteristics and circuit performance under the influence of TSV stress is proposed. An efficient algorithm is also proposed to simulate full-chip circuit variation under the impact of TSV stress based on a grid partition approach. Test cases corresponding to the aforementioned test chip are simulated for comparison with measurement data. by Li Yu. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Aggressive {{technology}} scaling {{raises the}} need for efficient methods to characterize and model circuit variation at both {{the front and back}} end of line, where critical parameters such as threshold voltage and parasitic capacitance must be carefully modeled for accurate circuit performance. This thesis addresses this need by contributing a test circuit methodology for the extraction of spatial, layout and size dependent variations at both device and interconnect levels. The test chip uses a scan chain approach combined with low-leakage and low-variation switches, and <b>Kelvin</b> sensing <b>connections,</b> providing access to detailed analog device characteristics in large arrays of test devices. Front end of line (FEOL) test structures include transistors of different sizes, number of polysilicon fingers, polysilicon fingers proximity, and orientation, for both NMOS and PMOS MOSFETs. Back end of line (BEOL) test structures include parasitic coupling, plane to plane and crossover capacitances, measured using a charge-based capacitive measurement (CBCM) methodology integrated with switches in the scan chain. The testing of the designed test chip has proven successful for both device and interconnect test structures. (cont.) Different layout practices in both NMOS and PMOS transistors are seen to result in significant differences in mean and standard deviation of measured output current, with 95 % confidence or more. The FEOL structure analysis shows strong dependencies between layout practices: orientation offers a consistent but opposite offset in NMOS and PMOS transistors and variation increases for gate lengths split among fingers. Variation due to sizing follows Pelgrom's model, showing that variation increases for smaller gate lengths and widths, in both NMOS and PMOS transistors. Threshold voltage extraction and variation analysis also demonstrate how variation increases for smaller features. BEOL capacitances were extracted and sub-femto Farad changes were detected for capacitive test structures. Spatial analysis reveals a large die-to-die trend in device performance. The parameter extraction and variation analyses made possible by the variation test chip enable the identification of likely variation sources, quantification of circuit impact and sensitivity, and specification of layout practices for variation minimization. by Karen Mercedes González-Valentín Gettings.

40|$|The CRISTA {{instrument}} (CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere) {{is designed}} to analyse dynamical processes in the middle atmosphere. Emphasis is on small scale spatial structures. Several trace gases {{can be used as}} tracers for these atmospheric processes. Their abundance is derived from an analysis of their IR emissions measured at the earth limb. CRISTA is integrated in the free-flying satellite ASTROSPAS and will be launched in Oct. 1994 by the US Space Shuttle for a 10 day mission. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution the CRISTA instrument uses three independent telescopes for simultaneous measurements in three horizontal directions. The ''center'' telescope senses the atmosphere in a direction antiparallel to the flight vector. Two ''lateral'' telescopes are directed #+-# 18 wrt the center telescope. Cryogenic cooling of the optical system by supercritical Helium to temperatures of 10 Kelvin reduces thermal self emission of the CRISTA instrument and allows operation of high sensitivity doped semiconductor detectors. From a near earth orbit with a flight altitude of 300 km and an inclination of 57 CRISTA will cover the height regime from 20 km to 150 km with a vertical resolution of approximately 1, 5 km FOV by independently scanning the lines-of-sight of the three telescopes. One altitude scan lasts about 1 min. This yields a resolution of about 480 km along track. The three view directions result in a resolution across track of about 600 km, so that the atmosphere is sensed by a narrow grid of measurement points. Spectral analysis of the radiation received is performed by grating spectrometers of the Ebert-Fastie type. The wavelength range covered is 4 #mu#m to 71 #mu#m with a spectral resolution of about 500. A spectral scan is performed in 1 sec. CRISTA uses a total of 26 spectral channels. Each telescope has one spectrometer as focal plane instrument which is optimized for the wavelength range from 4 #mu#m to 14 #mu#m. The center telescope is equipped with an additional spectrometer for the wavelength interval from 15 #mu#m to 71 #mu#m. Three of the detectors for the FIR in this spectrometer need cooling below 4, 5 <b>Kelvin.</b> An efficient <b>connection</b> to a second subcooled Helium tank provides the necessary operating conditions. Due to the large wavelength interval, an all reflective optics with gold coated, nickel plated aluminum mirrors is used. As the mounting structure is also made from aluminum, image degradations due to differential thermal contractions are avoided. Special care has been taken to achieve high straylight rejection. This is to allow detection of weak atmospheric IR signals {{in the vicinity of the}} bright earth surface. Each telescope is a two stage optical system using a tiltable off axis spherical primary mirror, several flats for beam folding up to the first focus and a Cerny-Turner reimager including a Lyot stop as a second stage. Numerous tests show the ability of the optical system to meet the scientific objectives of the experiment. (orig.)
