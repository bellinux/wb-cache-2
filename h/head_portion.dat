6000|$|... "You {{will say}} that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have {{misunderstood}} {{the nature of the}} inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had never for an instant been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result,--and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, terminated the clew. 'There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded, {{in the top of the}} bottom sash, the <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of the nail. I now carefully replaced this <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete--the fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect.|$|E

50|$|The breed {{comes in}} many {{different}} colors in two main varieties, Gazzi and Schietti. Gazzi is a pied marking with the <b>head</b> and <b>portion</b> of the throat, the wings and the tail colored {{and the rest of}} the bird being white. Schietti's are non-pied.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is celebrated}} for wildflowers that appear mid-March to early April {{following}} good winter rain. Though set {{next to an}} interstate highway, the park's west face possesses an unspoiled Sonoran Desert setting. A small flat space {{on top of the}} spire can be reached via two trail <b>heads.</b> <b>Portions</b> of the trails are precarious, and hikers are aided by cables and catwalks, making the routes some of the few via ferrata in the United States. From the top, there is a view south to the Santa Catalina Mountains near Tucson, northwest to Tabletop Mountain near Casa Grande, north to the many mountain ranges surrounding Phoenix, and west to where the north-running Santa Cruz River runs underground supporting farms in a quaint desert valley.|$|R

50|$|The snout is rounded. The rostral is one-fourth {{the length}} of the {{shielded}} part of the <b>head.</b> <b>Portions</b> of the rostral are visible from above and shorter than its distance from the frontal. Nasals are in contact with each other behind the rostral. The frontal is slightly longer than it is broad. The diameter of the eyes is more than half {{the length of}} the ocular shield. The total length of the snake is 21 to 29 times the diameter of the body. The ventrals are twice as large as the contiguous scales. The end of tail is flat dorsally, obliquely truncated, with strongly keeled scales which are bi-, tri-, or quadricarinate. It has a terminal scute with a transverse ridge and two points.|$|R

50|$|Max-Max was the <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of a whitetail buck. In this show, {{he had a}} {{small red}} light bulb sitting on his snout, making him look a bit like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. He was voiced by Mike West.|$|E
50|$|The Pestle puffball fungus (Handkea exipuliformis) grows at {{the edge}} of the mainly birch scrub area. This large puffball fungus {{releases}} its spores by the decay of the <b>head</b> <b>portion,</b> leaving a pestle-like stem that persists through to the following summer.|$|E

5000|$|In 1905, Samuel Wendell Williston {{described}} FMNH UR88, {{a partial}} armored dinosaur skeleton {{consisting of a}} maxilla fragment, seven cervical and two dorsal vertebrae, part of a sacrum and both ilia, caudal vertebrae, parts of the scapulae, both humeral <b>heads,</b> <b>portions</b> of an ulna and both radii, a metacarpal, partial tibia, metatarsal, and armor including a shoulder spine and neck ring. [...] The specimen was in poor condition, as it had eroded from a slope and been walked on by cattle. [...] Ankylosaurians being very poorly known, Williston compared his new genus to Stegosaurus, and the armor to that of Glyptodon; like that mammal, Stegopelta had a fused section of armor (in its case over the pelvis). Roy Lee Moodie redescribed it in 1910, and considered it to be close to, if not the same as, Ankylosaurus.|$|R
5|$|The Mellotron is an electro-mechanical, {{polyphonic}} tape replay keyboard {{originally developed}} and built in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It {{evolved from a}} similar instrument, the Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more effectively. The instrument works by pulling a section of magnetic tape across a <b>head.</b> Different <b>portions</b> of the tape can be played to access different sounds.|$|R

5000|$|Uraba lugens is {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Mad Hatterpillar" [...] {{because of its}} {{distinctive}} exoskeletal feature. Every time it sheds the <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of its exoskeleton, the exoskeleton stays attached to its body. Over time, developing through its life span, the head grows bigger and sheds increasingly larger exoskeleton shells, which build upon each other.|$|E
50|$|The Sudarium is {{severely}} soiled and crumpled, with dark flecks that are symmetrically arranged but form no image, unlike the markings on the Shroud of Turin. However, {{some of those}} who accept the Shroud as authentic claim that many of the stains on the Sudarium match those on the <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of the Shroud. Believers (such as Vatican archivist Msgr Giulio Ricci, who studied them in 1995) contend that both cloths covered the same man.|$|E
5000|$|One of the book's central {{concepts}} {{is that as}} {{the human}} triune brain has evolved, it has retained and built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures. The <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of the [...] "ghost in the machine" [...] has, {{as a consequence of}} poor, inadequate connections, a rich potential for conflict. The primitive layers can, and may, together, overpower rational logic's hold. This explains a person's hate, anger and other such emotional distress.|$|E

50|$|A second {{option is}} wooden matches, but the smoker must ensure the {{chemical}} {{head of the}} match has burned away and only the burning wooden section is used to light the cigar.

The strike plate to ignite the match may contain one more of the following: glass particles, red phosphorus, and glue.|$|E

50|$|The Nijmegen Helmet is an Ancient Roman helmet, {{found in}} a gravel bed on the left bank of Waal river, near the Dutch city of Nijmegen in 1915.

50|$|It is {{believed}} that in Pernankila, the Lord Mahaganapathi is a Udbhava deity, who {{is also known as}} Swayambhoo (self incarnation). The divine idol of Mahaganapathi here was said to have been found by a lower class (scheduled caste) dalit farmer called Perna while ploughing his farm. The idol of Mahaganapathi hidden under the earth accidentally got stuck to his plough. As a result, the <b>head</b> <b>portion</b> of the idol was torn apart and astonishingly blood was gushing out of it. The farmer was awe stuck on seeing this unusual scene.|$|E

50|$|The signal <b>head</b> is the <b>portion</b> of a colour {{light signal}} which {{displays}} the aspects.
