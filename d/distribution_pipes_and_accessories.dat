40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of predicting the failure rate of water <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> house connections in a selected city in Poland by means of regression trees. Several regression tree models were built as part of modelling. Optimal models were selected (separately for each of the water conduit types) via an analysis of the so‚Äìcalled costs. The regression tree structure comprised independent variables, i. e. predictors (length, diameter, year of construction and material). The failure rates of the two types of water conduits were the dependent variable. The optimal models were characterized by the lowest costs and a relatively simple tree architecture. Operational data from the years 2001 ‚Äì 2012 were used to determine the experimental (real) values of the failure rate and to build regression tree models. The optimal models included eight divided nodes and nine end nodes. The ranking of the significance of the parameters showed that length was the predictor responsible for division on the successive tree levels. The obtained high consistency (0. 99) of the real data with the predicted ones indicates that the regression tree method can be used to analyze and assess the failure rate of water conduits...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} way {{of using}} biogas is to upgrade it to natural gas, which {{is referred to}} as Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) or biomethane. Biomethane, or biogas, is produced by biological processes of harnessing the ability of microorganisms to degrade organic material to methane. Some of the microorganisms are aerosolized from the digester into the biogas; afterwards a bio-film is formed that attaches to the surfaces of the <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> can find it was to the place where the end use of biogas takes place. This paper deals with the detection of microbial species in biogas, their influenceon corrosion and the potential risk that diseases can be spread via biogas using molecular techniques. Using molecular methods, we found that raw biogas contains about 8 million microorganisms per m 3, which is most likely the result of microbial transmission from the anaerobic digestion process. Some bacterial species may contribute to the corrosion of pipelines and equipment; others are opportunistic pathogens that can cause toxic reactions. However, most bacterial species, more than 40 % in biogas, are still unknown, as is their influence on the digestion process and on human health. Further studies are needed to better understand the behavior of microorganisms in anaerobic digestion and to preventmicrobial-influenced corrosion and microbial dissemination...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of {{concrete}} sewer pipes {{as a result}} of microbial actions is known as microbiologically induced concrete corrosion (MICC). Failure of sewer structures {{as a result of}} MICC causes extensive damage posing health risks and rehabilitation costs. Protective polymeric linings (e. g., epoxy and epoxy mortars) have been used widely in larger <b>distribution</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> manholes as MICC mitigation strategy due to their high resistance to acid attack. The main challenge, however, in the use of polymeric coating is their premature failure by delamination. Failure can occur within two years or less, when coating service life is expected to be 20 - 50 years. Our current studies suggest coatings provide sufficient resistance to acid migration, negating the potential role of acid attack to delamination but highlighting other potential pre-cursors to this phenomenon. This study examined the effect of moisture on epoxy bonding. Moisture is maintained on the wall and crown {{of concrete}} pipes as a result of humidity and rising tidal zones. It is known moisture can disrupt epoxy curing and when adsorbed could contribute to losses of mechanical properties attributed to the disruption of interchain hydrogen bonding by water molecules.

40|$|Fire dangers exist inside {{engine core}} and {{auxiliary}} power unit compartments of commercial airplanes where jet fuel or lubricant oil leaks can catch fire on hot engine surfaces. Fire suppressants need to be quickly dumped into the compartments to prevent any eruption of fire. To quickly deliver fire suppressant from a storage bottle through a <b>distribution</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> injection nozzles to vented engine compartments, a fire extinguishing system should be designed and installed effectively. In certification tests of a fire extinguishing system, the optimum installation of multiple injection nozzles {{is an important factor}} contributing to successful fire suppression. At the present time, the selection of the nozzle locations and orientations for fire extinguishing systems depends primarily on a series of ground tests continued until the optimum installation conditions are found that satisfy the minimum performance standard. The certification test process is time consuming and relies greatly on empiricism. This paper deals with a simulation method for a fire suppression process that is based on the computational fluid dynamics method of modeling the two-phase flow physics. The method has been applied to simulate the tests of engines, {{auxiliary power unit}}s, and the FAA‚Äôs Nacelle Fire Simulator. Analysis results so far reveal excellent correlation with the test data, demonstrating the validity of the simulation method. It is anticipated that the method would serve as a useful tool not only for designing efficient firex systems, but also for guiding certification tests...|$|R
