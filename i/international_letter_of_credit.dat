The legal usage of paper based documents is considered first. This is followed by discussion of the practical challenges that electronic negotiable Bills of Lading may pose, particularly in the lodgment of electronic records under <b>international</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> transactions. The paper concludes that current business practices within the international trade, shipping and banking industries need substantial changes before this type of electronic document can be introduced successfully...|$|E
40|$|The {{letter of}} credit {{continues}} to play an indispensable role in the financing and securing of international commercial transactions. Its usefulness and efficacy derives primarily {{from the fact that}} it is independent from the underlying relationship between buyer and seller. In a considerable number of cases, however, the independence of the {{letter of credit}} has been challenged as a result of fraud in the underlying transaction. After analyzing recent reforms of the regulatory framework governing letters of credit, this fraud exception to the independence principle will be reappraised in the light of current developments in Canada and the United States.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the remedy of {{avoidance}} under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in transactions where the parties have agreed on the payments {{to be made by}} a <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> The approach <b>of</b> the thesis is to evaluate whether the seller is entitled to the remedy of avoidance in a case where the buyer fails to open a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in accordance with the underlying contract of sale. The context of the study is the complex <b>international</b> environment. A <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is a typical payment instrument in international trade. The use <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is based on the need for security. They are usually resorted to in situations where there are doubts regarding the other party’s financial history, assets, or creditworthiness. Disputes involving <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> take place in the contractual network involving banks. The present thesis studies how the right to avoid the contract is affected by the said arrangement and the commercial purpose <b>of</b> a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> The legal framework is built around the CISG and the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600). In addition, a brief analysis of the matter {{from the perspective of the}} Finnish Sale of Goods Act is included. The concept <b>of</b> a non-conforming <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is evaluated mostly through case law. The Principles of International Commercial Contracts by the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (PICC), the Principles of European Contract Law (PECL) and the opinions of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Banking Commission are being used as supplementary legal sources in the interpretation of the provisions of the CISG. In addition, six Finnish experts on <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> were interviewed to gain a closer understanding of the prevailing practices within the industry. The structure of the present thesis is divided into four parts. Parts I and II, constituting a fairly large proportion of the thesis, deal with describing of the usages and mechanisms related to <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the commercial purpose <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> This is justified with the necessity of understanding the particular features of the industry in order to be able to evaluate the fulfilment of a fundamental breach in the given context. This necessity is highlighted in a complex business environment. Part III evaluates the threshold of what constitutes a fundamental from the perspective of the buyer’s failure to open a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in accordance with the contract. Part III is divided into chapters, each discussing different ways of constituting grounds for a fundamental breach. Part IV concludes with the key elements and findings regarding the fundamental breach and the right to avoid the contract...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> as {{a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is the commercial <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} considerations for exporters in international trade transactions is the aspect of payment. In the context of financial risk management, <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> enable the exporter to substitute the <b>credit</b> risk <b>of</b> the buyer with that of his bank. The <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> is a conditional payment guarantee, relying on one hundred per cent documentary accuracy to trigger the payment. Less than one hundred per cent compliance means {{the loss of the}} payment guarantee. Non-compliance is a significant problem as, according to the International Chamber of Commerce, worldwide documentary discrepancy rates against <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions have been estimated to be between sixty to seventy per cent. The mechanics <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions comprise a complex web of interactions between banks, traders and their service providers, providing a fertile ground for discrepancies and existing literature acknowledges this world-wide problem. In the UK, in 2000, losses were estimated to be AUD 305 million (£ 113) through non-compliant documents being presented under <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> – this amount did not include lost opportunities and cash flow problems. In the same year, a separate USA study <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> transactions confirmed the high discrepancy rate, but also claimed that as long as buyers want the goods discrepancies did not translate into financial losses. The findings were refuted by others. It is the potential loss of revenue caused by the mismanagement of risk that is foremost in this research. It is estimated that the annual value <b>of</b> <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Credit</b> business for manufacturing exports to ASEAN is approximately AUD 3. 5 billion, with losses estimated to be upwards of AUD 920 million.

40|$|Part I of this Article briefly {{describes}} the basic letter-of-credit transaction.

The data generally support the anecdotal information that led me to conduct the study: the documents presented in the 500 transactions I examined conformed to the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> only 27 % of the time. The payment transactions rendered the discrepancies irrelevant because the buyer waived the discrepancies {{in all but one}} case and provided full payment for the shipment in spite of the discrepant presentation. Part III uses the data and the interviews described above to assess the possible reasons for the common use <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> First, I reject the possibility that businesses use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> out <b>of</b> irrational habit or custom because the ready availability and frequent use of alternative payment transactions strongly suggests that businesses rationally use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Second, I evaluate the persuasiveness of the classic payment-assurance story and conclude that the payment-assurance story probably still has some plausibility, at least in contexts (such as many exports from the United States) where parties select the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> to compensate for the weakness of relational ties between the buyer and the seller. Finally, I consider some alternative reasons that might motivate commercial enterprises to use <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Specifically, I argue that the issuing bank’s ability to verify information about the purchaser and the transaction provides the most compelling reason for widespread use <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit...</b>|$|R
