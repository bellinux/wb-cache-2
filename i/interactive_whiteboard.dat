40|$|After {{many weeks}} of {{completing}} preliminary searches, I decided to research <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards.</b> I {{have always been}} interested in classroom technology. This interest recently increased since I had an opportunity to “play around ” with a SMART board in a technology class I took this summer. This experience along with my curiosity to learn more about <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> in hopes of creating a presentation to convince the leadership in my school to purchase <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> for classroom use are the major reasons that led me to pursue <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> as my research topic. As I began to search, I quickly found that <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> can yield a variety of search results. Therefore, I decided to specifically focus on the effects <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> have on student motivation in the learning process. I chose to address this particular issue because I feel that it would be major player in the leadership’s decision {{as to whether or not}} the boards would be purchased. It is my hope that through creating a compilation of a variety of research-based articles showing how <b>Interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> affect student motivation in the learning process, my school’...|$|R

40|$|Applications and {{practices}} of <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> (IWBs) in school learning is important focus and development trend for developmented countries in recent years. There are rare researches and discussions about IWB teaching materials for course teaching and teaching effectiveness. As for the aspect of academic studies, there is more practical teaching sharing for subjects such as language learning, mathematical learning and physical science learning; however, it is rarely seen empirical research on the application of IWB for educational acceptances of <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboards.</b> Based on its imporatances, we summarize previous literatures to establish a theoretical model for <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> (IWBs).

In the project, schools were offered to participate in free training-courses {{to learn how to use}} the <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboard’s</b> software.   An online survey was created with the assistance of the administration’s IT pedagogue. The purpose with the survey was to learn about teachers’ habits and thoughts concerning the new technology.   To be able to understand the technology of the <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboards,</b> the paper mentions the theoretical background of the technology. It’s also declared the possible accessories of these and type of functionalities.   Information technology’s awareness and qualification are very important in teaching, especially when the <b>interactive</b> <b>whiteboards</b> are used; therefore the importance of Information Technology at school was taken in consideration. The survey showed a very high IT- qualification among teachers.   Another survey was created and sent to other schools in Sweden.
