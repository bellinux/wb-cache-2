25|$|One {{well-known}} {{strategy is}} the covered call, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price rises above the exercise price, the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as put-call parity and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index {{for the performance of}} a buy-write strategy is the CBOE S 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker symbol BXM).|$|E
25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} put option to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price at expiration is below the exercise price by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price at expiration is above the exercise price, he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if exercise price is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> {{underlying}} <b>stock's</b> {{market price}} {{is below the}} option's strike price when expiration arrives, the option owner (buyer) can exercise the put option, forcing the writer to buy <b>the</b> underlying <b>stock</b> at <b>the</b> strike price. That allows the exerciser (buyer) {{to profit from the}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>stock's</b> market price and the option's strike price. But <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock's</b> market price is above the option's strike price at the end of expiration day, the option expires worthless, and the owner's loss is limited to the premium (fee) paid for it (the writer's profit).|$|R
30|$|The {{reason of}} taking α< r is that stocks with {{dividends}} are considered for <b>the</b> American call <b>stock</b> options in general. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> {{do not have}} dividends, the American call options are actually European call options. ESOs are American call options, so <b>the</b> case of <b>stocks</b> with dividends is considered. Thus we take α< r.|$|R
50|$|The {{disparate}} {{groups of}} victims were linked by {{a letter to}} the local police chief written on United States Army stationery.

25|$|Strategies {{are often}} used to {{engineer}} a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security. For example, buying a butterfly spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price on the expiration date is near the middle exercise price, X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.|$|E
25|$|Iran is the last, large {{untapped}} {{emerging market}} in the world. According to many experts, the economy of Iran has many investment opportunities, particularly on its stock exchange. The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market grows stronger, it will undoubtedly attract idle capital. In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of the bourse are the Iranian real estate market, cars and gold (with gold {{being used as a}} store of value, a hedging tool against hyperinflation and the devaluation of the Rial). According to Goldman Sachs, Iran is forecast to reach the highest economic growth between 2015 and 2025 and join the world's largest economies (world's 12th economy by 2025). Since 2012, TSE has served as a safe heaven against international sanctions and inflation.|$|E

50|$|In 1951, for his {{undergraduate}} thesis at Princeton University, John C. Bogle {{conducted a}} study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn any more money than if they invested in S&P 500 stock market index.

50|$|Many short sellers place a {{stop order}} with their {{stockbroker}} after selling a stock short—an {{order to the}} brokerage to cover <b>the</b> position <b>if</b> <b>the</b> price of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above. In some cases, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock's</b> price skyrockets, <b>the</b> stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.|$|R

2500|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} can sell the stock short or instead sell, or [...] "write", a call. The trader selling a call {{has an obligation}} to sell the stock to the call buyer at a fixed price ("strike price"). If the seller does not own the stock when the option is exercised, he is obligated to purchase the stock from the market at the then market price. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price decreases, the seller of the call (call writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price increases over the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the seller will lose money, with the potential loss being unlimited.|$|E
2500|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy the}} stock or instead sell, or [...] "write", a put.

Things became more complicated when a man calling himself the [...] "Chairman of the Forces of Evil" [...] threatened to murder selected black women <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stocking</b> Strangler was not stopped.

50|$|In finance, {{an example}} of an undiversified {{portfolio}} is to hold only one stock. This is risky; {{it is not unusual for}} a single stock to go down 50% in one year. It is less common for a portfolio of 20 stocks to go down that much, especially if they are selected at random. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> are selected from a variety of industries, company sizes and types it is still less likely.|$|R

2500|$|Naked {{short selling}} {{is a case}} of short selling without first {{arranging}} a borrow. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> is in short supply, finding shares to borrow can be difficult. The seller may also decide not to borrow the shares, in some cases because lenders are not available, or because the costs of lending are too high. [...] When shares are not borrowed within the clearing time period and the short-seller does not tender shares to the buyer, the trade is considered to have [...] "failed to deliver." [...] Nevertheless, the trade will continue to sit open or the buyer may be credited the shares by the DTCC until the short-seller either closes out the position or borrows the shares.|$|E
2500|$|Mandatory {{convertibles}} are {{a common}} variation of the vanilla subtype, especially on the US market. Mandatory convertible would force the holder to convert into shares at maturity—hence the term [...] "Mandatory". Those securities would very often bear two conversion prices, making their profiles similar to a [...] "risk reversal" [...] option strategy. The first conversion price would limit the price where the investor would receive the equivalent of its par value back in shares, the second would delimit where the investor will earn more than par. Note that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> price is below the first conversion price the investor would suffer a capital loss compared to its original investment (excluding the potential coupon payments). Mandatory convertibles {{can be compared to}} forward selling of equity at a premium.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that open-end structures undermine asset managers’ incentives to attack long-term mispricing. First, we compare open-end funds with closed-end funds. Closed-end funds purchase more underpriced stocks than open-end funds, especially <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>stocks</b> involve high arbitrage risk. We then show that hedge funds with high share restrictions, having a lower degree of open-ending, also trade against long-term mispricing to a larger extent than other hedge funds.
