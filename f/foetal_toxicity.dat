40|$|The most {{frequent}} toxigenic fungi in the Europe are Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium species. They produce aflatoxin B 1 transformed into aflatoxin M 1 {{found in the}} milk, as well as Ochratoxins and Zearalenone, Fumonisin B 1, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin and deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin), which are of increasing concern in human health. These mycotoxins are under continuous survey in the Europe, but the regulatory aspects {{still need to be}} set up and/or harmonised at the European level. They are found in foodstuffs and are not destroyed by normal industrial processing or cooking since they are heat-stable. Some of their metabolites are still toxic and may be involved in human diseases. Their toxic effects (liver, kidney and haematopoietic toxicity, immune toxicity, <b>foetal</b> <b>toxicity,</b> teratogenicity, and mainly carcinogenicity) are mostly known in experimental models. Chemical assays are of major importance for the determination of mycotoxins. Generally, all chemical methods for the analysis of mycotoxins include the basic steps of extraction, clean-up, separation, detection, quantification and confirmation of identity. The various approaches that exist for the determination of nephrotoxic mycotoxins, and in particular the ochratoxins are discusse...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGBC is a {{rare disease}} and {{chemotherapy}} in this setting lacks a standardized approach. Patients 16 – 30  weeks pregnant with locally advanced/metastatic disease or with high risk of recurrence after surgery were evaluated. Twenty patients received weekly epirubicin 35  mg/m. Median maternal age was 37  years (23 – 42). Median gestational age at chemotherapy was 19  weeks. Thirteen patients were treated after surgery while 7 had locally advanced tumours of which one had liver metastases. Mean total epirubicin dose was 420  mg/m with a median number of 12 administrations (4 – 16). No grade 3 – 4 toxicities were observed. No foetal adverse events were observed except 1 premature delivery at 28  weeks. Births were induced by caesarean section in 12 patients at a median gestational age of 35  weeks. No malformations were reported except 1 newborn with polycystic kidney. At a median age of 2  years, neurological, cardiological and immunological development was normal in all children as reported by their parents. In 7 / 20 patients with evaluable disease, five had an objective response. At a median follow-up of 38  months, 17 patients are alive; 14 are disease free. Weekly epirubicin appears safe and effective with low <b>foetal</b> <b>toxicity</b> and could be considered in GBC...|$|E
40|$|The <b>foetal</b> <b>toxicity</b> of the methyl {{isocyanate}} metabolites trimethylamine (TMA) and S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) glutathione (SMG) was studied in mice. Administration of TMA but not SMG during pregnancy decreased foetal weight and selectively inhibited the postnatal growth of male offspring. Both TMA and SMG were teratogenic to mouse embryos in culture. TMA caused a dorsal-rostral {{split in the}} head and SMG produced distortion and separation of somites; both agents decreased the growth of embryos. The inhibition of embryonic growth by TMA could not be antagonized by antioxidants or growth factors. The embryotoxic effects of SMG could be antagonized by glutathione (GSH). TMA inhibited the incorporation of $ sp 3 $H-thymidine, $ sp 3 $H-uridine and $ sp 3 $H-leucine into their respective macromolecules; SMG inhibited the incorporation of $ sp 3 $H-thymidine. Uptake by the yolk sac placenta and incorporation into embryonic proteins of $ sp 3 $H-leucine-labelled proteins but not of free $ sp 3 $H-leucine was inhibited by TMA at concentrations which did not inhibit lysosomal degradation of proteins. SMG inhibited the uptake and incorporation of both free $ sp 3 $H-leucine and $ sp 3 $H-leucine-labelled proteins. The inhibition of receptor-mediated uptake by SMG could be antagonized by GSH. The data suggest that TMA, and SMG produce embryotoxicity mainly by an inhibition of uptake mechanisms of the yolk sac placenta...|$|E
40|$|Abstract About 5 - 10 % {{of women}} {{experience}} depression during pregnancy. The potentially {{adverse effects of}} pharmacological treatment (e. g. teratogenicity, <b>toxicity,</b> <b>foetal</b> developmental abnormalities and withdrawal symptoms) on both {{the mother and the}} foetus mean that psychopharmacological treatments have limited application for pregnant women. In these cases treatment needs to be tailored to the individual patient and non-pharmacological options may be appropriate. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) may be viable alternatives for these patients. We report on three patients in their first trimester of pregnancy suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). All three were initially treated with TMS and psychotherapy because of the reduced risk of side effects. Two patients failed to respond adequately to treatment and were switched to ECT. The third patient displayed an adequate response to TMS but failed to maintain the improvement. This patient had to receive ECT in the post-partum period due to on-going depressive symptoms. Subsequently this patient responded adequately to ECT. Further studies of novel, non-pharmacological treatment methods for MDD during pregnancy (such as TMS and ECT) and detailed investigations of the factors associated with treatment responses in such patients are needed. Our cases demonstrate the need {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} TMS in larger samples o...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 80 – 90 % of {{all women}} using {{intravenous}} heroin are of reproductive age. Although heroin use can cause menstrual irregularities such as amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhea and suppression of ovulation, pregnancy is not uncommon. (1) Maternal heroin use during pregnancy is {{associated with an increased}} risk of a number of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including low birthweight (LBW) and reduced birthweight neonates, ante-partum haemorrhage and increased neonatal mortality. (2 – 4) The currently accepted management of the pregnant heroin user involves methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Importantly, no serious <b>foetal</b> <b>toxicity</b> has been associated with methadone. (5, 6) Naltrexone, a long-acting opiate antagonist that can be administered to persons who have detoxified completely from heroin (7) and which is effective in completely blocking the effects of heroin, (8) has also been used in a depot preparation in the management of the heroin dependent pregnant women. In this form of maintenance, naltrexone is delivered by a surgically inserted sustained release preparation. Recently, a number of case studies have described positive obstetric and neonatal outcomes associated with the management of pregnant women with implant naltrexone; (9) however, no data on blood naltrexone concentration with time has been provided to date. The present case study provides profiles of blood concentrations of naltrexone and 6 -beta naltrexol following naltrexone implant over pregnancy. It uses data from blood samples collected over pregnancy by the treating clinic (Australian Medical Research Procedures Foundation (AMPRF), Perth, Western Australia) as part of routine clinical management to investigate the length of time naltrexone blood levels are sustained above 2 ng/mL following implant. Bloods were analysed for naltrexone by the Forensic Science Laboratory, Chemistry Centre (WA) by liquid chromatography and mass spectrophotometry using an adaptation of the method described by Bugge et al. (10) These methods are able to quantify naltrexone and its active metabolite 6 -beta-naltrexol in human blood with a limit of detection of 0. 5 ng/mL for both compounds...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cytochrome}} P 450 3 A 7 (CYP 3 A 7) and cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4) are hepatic metabolising enzymes which {{participates in}} the biotransformation of endo- and exogenous substances in foetuses and neonates respectively. These CYP 3 A enzymes display an inverse relationship: CYP 3 A 7 is the dominant enzyme in the foetal liver, whereas the expression of CYP 3 A 4 is low. After parturition there is {{a shift in the}} expression, thus CYP 3 A 7 is down regulated, while the level of CYP 3 A 4 gradually increases and becomes the dominant metabolising CYP 3 A enzyme in the adult. The minipig is increasingly being used as a model for humans in biomedical studies, because of its many similarities with the human physiology and anatomy. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether, as in humans, a shift is seen in the hepatic expression of a CYP 3 A 7 - like enzyme to cytochrome P 450 3 A 29 (CYP 3 A 29) (an orthologue to the human CYP 3 A 4) in minipigs. This was elucidated by examining the hepatic mRNA expression of CYP 3 A 7 and CYP 3 A 29 in 39 foetuses and newborn Göttingen minipigs using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Furthermore the immunochemical level of CYP 3 A 7 -LE and CYP 3 A 29 was measured in liver microsomes using western blotting. The expression of CYP 3 A 29 was approximately 9 - fold greater in neonates compared to foetuses, and a similar difference was reflected on the immunochemical level. It was not possible to detect a significant level of foetal CYP 3 A 7 mRNA, but immunoblotting showed a visible difference depending on age. This study demonstrates an increase in the expression of CYP 3 A 29, the CYP 3 A 4 orthologue in perinatal minipigs as in humans, which suggests that the minipig could be a good model when testing for human <b>foetal</b> <b>toxicity</b> towards CYP 3 A 4 substrates...|$|E
