40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the design of}} structures for improved global damage tolerance is presented. <b>In</b> its <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition</b> the structure is designed subject to strength, displacement and buckling constraints. In the damaged condition the only constraint is that the structure will not collapse. The collapse load calculation is formulated as a maximization problem and solved by an interior extended penalty function. The design for minimum weight subject to constraints on the undamaged structure and a specified level of the collapse load is a minimization problem which is also solved by a penalty function formulation. Thus the overall problem is of a nested or multilevel optimization. Examples are presented to demonstrate the difference between the present and more traditional approaches...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of low-velocity impact damage and unloaded circular holes on the compressive strength of a 48 -ply orthotropic graphite/epoxy flat laminate. Specimens were impacted by a 1. 27 -cm-diameter aluminum sphere with speeds from 52 to 101 m/x to simulate momenta typical of low-velocity impact hazards that can occur in commercial aircraft service. It is shown that low-velocity impact damage can significantly degrade the static compressive strength of the laminate. Specimens that fail at axial strains above 0. 008 <b>in</b> the <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition</b> can fail at strains as low as 0. 0031 when impacted at 100 m/s.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{dependent}} on immune lysis is described for {{the isolation of}} intracellular symbiotes from two species of flagellate protozoa Blastocrithidia culicis and Crithidia oncopeiti. The symbiote-containing flagellates are exposed to complement and antisera prepared in rabbits against symbiote-free organisms. The immune lysis seems to weaken the plasma membranes of the flagellates so that subsequent application of gentle shearing force liberates the intraceUular entities <b>in</b> an <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition.</b> The symbiotes are then separated from other cellular components by DNAse digestion and differential centrifugation. The average recovery of symbiotes isolated by this method is 20 %. Light and electron microscopy establishes the structural integrity and numerical abundance of isolated symbiotes in the final fractions. Integrity of symbiotes is further indicated by the high activity of a marker enzyme, uroporphyrinogen I synthetase. The DNA's of symbiote-containing and symbiote-free flagellates, and of isolated symbiotes were purified and compared after isopycnic centrifugation. Th...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate the effect of low-velocity impact damage on the compression strength of filamentary-composite hat-stiffened panels. Twenty-four specimens of three design configurations fabricated from graphite-epoxy and boron-epoxy materials were tested. All three design configurations met the design buckling requirements <b>in</b> the <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition.</b> The impact damage was caused by firing aluminum spheres at the panels to simulate impact on aircraft from runway stones. Panels were damaged by impact in the hat cap or in the skin beneath the hat cap (regions of high axial stiffness) and in the skin between stiffeners (region of low axial stiffness). The panels were relatively insensitive to impact damage in the regions of low axial stiffness but were very sensitive to impact damage in the regions of high axial stiffness. Test results suggest that impact damage may be more dependent on the matrix properties than on the fiber properties of the composite materials considered...|$|R

50|$|One highly {{important}} {{preventative measure}} in avoiding a flat {{is to ensure}} your spare tire is properly inflated and <b>in</b> good, <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition.</b> If the spare tire has an irregular sidewall (bumps, dents, or other deformities) the spare tire needs to be replaced. Also check for dry rot (which looks like small cracks in the sidewall) as well as good tread depth. New spare tires {{can be purchased at}} tire repair shops, automotive dealerships, even over the internet. If for any reason, the process of checking the inflation pressure of your spare is too arduous of a task for you to perform (on some vehicles this requires removing the spare tire if a full-size, could be very heavy or sliding underneath the vehicle on SUVs and pick-up trucks); when getting an oil change done or other routine maintenance one can (and should) request that the technician working on their car checks the spare tire pressure. If one chooses this route, it will help the technician if you remove items that may block access to the spare tire. Most auto technicians will only check the pressures of the tires already on the vehicle, and will ignore the spare tire unless one requests it be checked.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{detecting}} {{structural damage}} by vibration testing in a timber bridge model of 3 m× 1 m× 0. 2 m supported on four stiff columns. Impact hammer tests {{were carried out}} to obtain frequency response functions (FRFs) <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> and damaged <b>condition</b> inwhich one plank of 90 mmwidewas removed. The FRFs were processed by the Damage LocationVector (DLV) algorithm to determine the location and extent of damage. The DLV algorithm requires the dynamic stiffness matrix of the structure which is deducible from a spatial model of the structure. A simple finite element model (FEM) using Bernoulli beam model {{was used in this}} paper to obtain the dynamic stiffness matrix and impact vibration testing was used to obtain the FRFs curves.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{development}} and validation of a vibroacustic technique to welding defects detection, especially for welded reinforcing structures. In welded structures subjected to dynamic cyclic loads may appear and propagate fatigue cracks due to local structural damage. These cracks may initiate due to the technological parameters used in welding process, or due to environmental operating conditions. By the means of Finite Element Method (FEM), the natural frequencies and shape modes of more welded steel specimens are determined. The analysis is carried out <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition</b> as well as damaged one, after artificially induced damages. The experimental measurement of the vibroacustic response is carried out by using a condenser microphone, which is suitable for high-fidelity acoustic measurements in the frequency range of 20 – 20. 000 Hz. The vibration responses of the welded specimens, in free-free conditions, are carried out using algorithms based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Prony's series.

40|$|A {{method that}} uses machine {{learning}} {{to detect and}} localize damage in railway bridges under various environmental conditions is proposed and validated in this work. The developed algorithm uses vertical and lateral deck accelerations as damage- sensitive features. Indeed, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained to predict deck accelerations <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition</b> given: previous vibration data, air temperature and characteristics of the train crossing the bridge (speed, load position and load magnitude). After an appropriate training period, the comparison between ANN-predicted and measured accelerations allows to compute prediction errors. A Gaussian Process is then used to stochastically characterize prediction errors in undamaged conditions using train speed as independent variable. Recorded vibration data leading to abnormal prediction errors are flagged as damage. The method is validated both on a simple numerical example and on data recorded on a real structure. In the latter case, an appropriate algorithm was developed {{with the aim of}} extracting vehicles characteristics from the acceleration time histories. Together with this part of the algorithm for the pre-processing of recorded accelerations, the novelty of the developed method is the addition of air temperature to the input. It allows separating between structure responses that can be flagged as damage from those only affected by environmental conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Strengthening of masonry {{structures}} with FRP strips {{embedded in}} the bed joints is an innovative technique, investigated up to now only in very few research works. The intervention can be particularly suitable for confining the masonry under compressive loads, by easy in-situ applications. In the research presented in the paper both mechanical and feasibility aspects of the proposed technique are evaluated. An extensive selection of materials (both for repointing mortars and strips) was preventively performed in order to optimize the strengthening and durability performances. Particularly, studies on bond were carried out considering the different stress conditions under which a masonry member can be subjected, e. g. {{at the time of}} the application and under more severe actions. Finally, to validate the technique under real critical conditions, experimental tests on specimens are going to be performed: a series of brick masonry panels <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> and pre-damaged <b>conditions</b> will be reinforced and than subjected to compressive loads and creep simulations...|$|R

30|$|This {{method was}} also used to {{investigate}} drop-weight loading of three-dimensional angle-interlock woven glass fibre/unsaturated polyester resin composites with a conical impactor (Sun et al. 2012 a, b). The corresponding load-displacement histories and failure modes were obtained from numerical simulation and verified by experimental results. It was observed that as the impact energy increased, both the maximum impact load and deflection also increased. Sevkat et al. (2009 a, b) adopted a very similar approach to simulate drop-weight tests of hybrid plain-woven glass-graphite fibres/toughened epoxy composites with commercial 3 D dynamic nonlinear FE software, LS-DYNA. Evolution of dynamic force, strain and absorbed energy as well as post-impact damage patterns obtained from experiments and FE simulations were in a good agreement. Colombo and Vergani (2016) characterized a textile carbon-fibre-reinforced composite <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> and damaged <b>conditions,</b> with numerical and analytical micromechanical approaches, {{in order to provide}} a method for assessing its residual stiffness after impact. An extent of degradation of the damaged composite was estimated by Blackketter-type reduction factors applied to elastic properties of unit cells. The results showed that the values of the experimental in-plane residual stiffness in the damaged region decreased to 46 % of its initial value. With this simple general approach, it was possible to predict a range of stiffness reduction for braided composites. However, in these studies, neither progressive damage nor plastic effect was accounted for in the FE models. Besides, values of the maximum impact displacement and interface delamination were not well captured. Usually, such approaches do not aim to run explicit simulations of the impact.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The use of {{threaded}} connection {{is a valuable}} alternative to conventional welding in tubular constructions, e. g. pipelines, drill pipes and deep water risers. Those applications are normally exposed to environmental hazards – wave induced vibrations, temperature changes, etc. – as well as subjected to severe service conditions. A classical way to determine fatigue strength in many engineering situations is to calibrate material models by means of ad hoc designed experiments. Unfortunately, {{it is very difficult}} in this case even under laboratory conditions due to complicated stress and strain states in the contacting tapered helical thread surfaces of the connection. Therefore, a classical four-point bending fatigue test setup has been built with a real pipe specimen of 3. 75 meter long, consisting of two standard API pipes connected by a threaded coupling, under unsymmetric (non-zero average) load control cycles. A complete vibration study has been carried out based on input-output modal tests for the entire period of the fatigue experiment. Input excitation is due to hammer impact and responses are recorded by accelerometers and by reusable dynamic strain gauges. The measured modal strains from the dynamic strain gauges allow for direct calculation of the modal curvatures, rather than deriving approximately from acceleration information.

40|$|This master thesis {{deal with}} {{calculation}} and condition assessment of Lundevann bridge, {{which is a}} corrosion-damaged bridge with decks of pretensioned concrete beams, spanning between transversal beams. The transversal beams are connected to piles which transfers the loads to the ground. The thesis presents the theoretical basis that underlies the calculations, as well as literature on the concrete's decomposition mechanisms. Loads and load combinations are calculated by the Norwegian Road Safety Authority's Handbook R 412 for bridge classification, and the capacity checks are performed according to NS-EN 1992 - 1 - 1 (Eurocode 2). The bridge is modeled in Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis Professional 2017, and used for analysis of dimensional loads. Capacity control of the constructive parts of the bridges is performed for its undamaged condition according to current regulations. A visual inspection and a special inspection {{have been carried out}} with extraction of new concrete samples, which together with previous inspections forms the basis for an assessment of the current damage level on the bridge. RCT and ISE methods have been carried out in order to analyze the concrete samples, and perform chloride measurements. New samples that correspond to previous withdrawal points are compared to evaluate the development of chloride content in the concrete elements. Based on capacity checks and damage assessment calculations have been made in order to estimate the consequences the damage will have for the load bearing capacity of Lundevann bridge. This has been done by examining the consequences of loss of concrete cover in the pressure zone, and by reducing the reinforcement area. Capacity controls of the bridge <b>in</b> <b>undamaged</b> <b>condition</b> indicated that the bridge elements have sufficient load bearing capacity. The transversal beam in axis 9 has, however, exceeded the bending moment capacity in the longitudinal direction of the bridge, and attention should be paid. The extent of damage due to corroded reinforcement is greatest for the transversal beams of axis 2 - 8, and extensive corrosion of the tension reinforcement above the supports (piles) may be critical to the beams bending capacity. Since the damage level is difficult to determine exactly without direct measurements, the need of remediation measures on the transversal beams seems to be large...|$|E
