The PWM controller modules are designed by adopting the very high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language (VHDL) and the Xilinx Spartan- 3 E starter board, field programmable gate array (FPGA). The use of PWM control for DC motors is widely used due to reliable performance. The starting torque, for example, in a DC motor can be higher several orders in magnitude than that for a comparable size AC motor. PWM control for DC motors enables a higher efficient, wide range of speed control and operation is at speeds less or more than the rated speed. There are many applications of DC motors, which include computers cooling systems, printers, subway trains, airplanes etc. The extensive usage of DC motors in different applications makes PWM speed control systems strongly needed.

Stroke is a clinical illness resulting in long lasting neurological deficits often affecting somatosensory and motor cortices. More than half of those that recover from a stroke survive with disability in their upper arm and need rehabilitation therapy to help in regaining functions of daily living. In this paper, we demonstrated a prototype of a low-cost, ultra-light and wearable soft robotic assistive device that could aid administration of elbow motion therapies to stroke patients. In order to assist the rotation of the elbow joint, the soft modules which consist of soft wedge-like cellular units was inflated by air to produce torque at the elbow joint. Highly compliant rotation can be naturally realised by the elastic property of soft silicone and pneumatic control of air.

40|$|It {{appears that}} {{biological}} organisms can be harnessed as substrates for computation. Biological cells possess important characteristics, such as energy efficiency, selfreproduction, and miniature scale, {{that make them}} attractive for many applications. Examples include embedded intelligence in materials, sensing, smart medicine, and nanoscale fabrication. Vast numbers of programmed cells executing in parallel will enable cheap computation. This abstract argues that individual cells are programmable, and presents a programming paradigm for colonies of cells. Cellular Gates A fundamental chemical process in the cell is the production of proteins from genes encoded in the DNA. The cell performs important regulatory activities through DNA-binding proteins that repress the production of specific proteins. [2] proposes using this regulatory mechanism to implement digital logic inverters. This idea can be extended to construct complex digital logic, making the cell a self-contained computational unit. Microbial <b>circuit</b> design creates <b>a</b> biological digital <b>circuit</b> using <b>a</b> small set of basic gates and a database of protein kinetic rates. To prevent interference between the gates, a different protein is used for each unique signal. Therefore, the number of proteins needed <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> is proportional <b>to</b> {{the complexity of the}} circuit. The design process requires searching the database and assigning suitable proteins to each gate, where the dynamic characteristics of the gate may differ depending on the proteins chosen. The basic gates must be robust enough to function {{with a wide variety of}} kinetically different proteins.

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} network {{is thought to}} be {{involved}} in adaptation oforganism's behavior when facing its positive and negative consequences,that is, in reinforcement learning. It has been hypothesized thatdopamine (DA) modulated plasticity of synapses projecting from differentcortical areas to the input nuclei of the basal ganglia, the striatum,plays a central role in this form of learning, being responsible forupdating future outcome expectations and action preferences. In thisscheme, DA transmission is considered to convey a prediction errorsignal that is generated if internal expectations do not match theoutcomes observed after action execution. Aiming towards a model of <b>a</b> canonical <b>circuit</b> for learning task-conformbehavior from both reward and punishment, we extended a previouslyintroduced spiking actor-critic network model of the basal ganglia [1]to contain the segregation of both the dorsal (actor) and ventral(critic) striatum into populations of D 1 and D 2 medium spiny neurons(MSNs) [2]. This segregation allows explicit, separate representation ofboth positive and negative expected outcomes by the distinct populationsin the ventral striatum. The positive and negative components ofexpected outcome were fed to dopamine (DA) neurons in SNc/VTA region,which compute and signal reward prediction error by DA release. In the dorsal striatum, we <b>implemented</b> <b>a</b> winner-takes-all (WTA) <b>circuit</b> <b>to</b> choose between <b>a</b> number of possible actions. We show that plasticity, modulated by D 1 and D 2 receptors, combined withWTA mechanism results in a TD-Learning like funcional circuit. This modeling approach can be extended in the future work to study howabnormal D 1 /D 2 plasticity may lead to a reorganization of the basalganglia network towards pathological, dysfunctional states, like forinstance those observed in Parkinson disease under condition ofprogressive dopamine depletion.

40|$|Products {{based on}} Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) {{technology}} offer a unique solution to today's energy conversion storage needs. PEM products have undergone continual development {{since the late}} 1950 's for many diverse applications. Rooted in rigorous aerospace applications, this technology is now ''breaking away'' to provide commercial solutions to common power, energy, and industrial gas feedstock problems. Important developments in PEM electrolyzers and various energy conversion devices (e. g. engines and fuel cells) can now be combined to {{form the basis for}} a revolutionary energy storage system that provides a much needed link to renewable resources, and offers a credible alternative for off-grid power applications. This technology operates by converting electrical energy into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen as part of a water electrolysis process when excess power is available. When the primary source of power is unavailable, chemical energy is converted into electrical energy through an external combustion heat engine or other energy conversion device. The Phase II portion of this program began in May of 2000. The goal of Phase II of the project was to cost reduce the hydrogen generator as a critical link to having a fully sustainable hydrogen energy system. The overall goal is to enable the link to sustainability by converting excess renewable power into hydrogen and having that hydrogen available for conversion back to power, on demand. Furthermore, the cost of the capability must be less the $ 1, 000 per kW (electrical power into the generator) and allow for a variety of renewable technology inputs. This cost target is based on a production volume of 10, 000 units per year. To that end, Proton undertook an aggressive approach to cost reduction activities surrounding the 6 kW, 40 standard cubic foot per hour (scfh) HOGEN hydrogen generator. The electrical side of the system targeted a number of areas that included approaches to reduce the cost of the power supply and associated electronics as well as improving efficiency, <b>implementing</b> <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> board <b>to</b> replace the discreet electrical components in the unit, and evaluating the system issues when operating the unit with a variety of renewable inputs. On the mechanical side of the system the targets involved creative use of manifolds to reduce components and plumbing, overall fitting reduction through layout simplification and welded tube assemblies, and the development of an inexpensive gas drying methodology to remove moisture and improve gas purity. Lastly, activities surrounding the electrolysis cell stack focused on lower cost stack compression approaches and cost reduction of critical components. The last year of this project focused on validating the cost reductions mentioned above and advancing these cost reductions forward into a larger hydrogen generator. This larger hydrogen generator is a 60 kW, 380 scfh, HOGEN hydrogen generator. Most of these efforts were in the control board and manifold development areas. The results achieved over the life of this program are in line with the goals of the Department of Energy. Proton projects that the current design of the 40 scfh generator projected to a volume of 10, 000 units per year would be in the range of $ 1, 500 per kilowatt. Furthermore, continuing efforts on materials substitution and design enhancements {{over the next few years}} should bring the cost of the system to the $ 1, 000 per kilowatt goal for a system of this size. This report provides the technical details behind the cost reduction efforts undertaken during the Phase II portion of the program...|$|R
