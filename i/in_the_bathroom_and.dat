An upset Lola takes refuge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> Charlie {{attempts}} to comfort her. Lola explains that her father trained her as a boxer, but disowned her when she showed up for a match in drag. The two discover their similarly complex feelings toward their fathers, and Lola introduces herself by her birth name: Simon ("Not My Father's Son").|$|E
5|$|Lauren and Whitney decline their {{invitations to}} the housewarming party, and instead plan an impromptu outing {{at the club}} Les Deux. Meanwhile, during the housewarming party, Jenn Bunney makes a brief {{appearance}} at the apartment, although Heidi is disappointed after realizing that Lauren will not be attending. Unaware that they will run into Heidi and Spencer, Lauren and Audrina attend a birthday party for their friend Frankie Delgado the following day. As Lauren leaves for the bathroom after Heidi gives her a letter, Heidi tells Audrina that she is unsure {{of the reason for}} the tension between them. Audrina finds Lauren <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> they read the letter together, which details Heidi's interest in rekindling their friendship. Angered that Heidi will not acknowledge the sex tape rumors, Lauren decides to exit the club.|$|E
5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that it is {{completely}} empty except for a video camera which has been set up. She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to the bedroom door. She locks herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E

50|$|Many {{original}} features survive {{throughout the}} residence, including ebonised timber detailing, leadlight doors, built-in leadlight display cabinets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> living/dining room and entry hall and timber panelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entry. Some tongue-and-groove ceilings {{have been replaced}} with decorative plaster ceilings and new fittings and fixtures have been installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>and</b> kitchen. <b>The</b> guest rooms are air-conditioned.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Rick {{manages to}} enforce his policy {{of getting rid}} of the drugs being dealt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>and</b> {{clearing}} out <b>the</b> hallways — but not always with success. Because the students are now forced to go to class, some of the more unruly students become increasingly disruptive, including White Zac (J.J. Cohen), who eventually attempts to rape one of the teachers, Ms. Orozco (Rae Dawn Chong), with whom Rick is beginning to form a close friendship.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
25|$|A {{traveling}} projectionist of pornographic films {{is sent to}} {{the countryside}} by his employer. On his return, he sees lewd graffiti <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> this revitalizes his libido.|$|E
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks they are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating {{on the sofa and}} simply urinating {{in the middle of the}} room.|$|E
50|$|The Maitu {{community}} {{is powered by}} manual energy production machines---treadmills and rowing machines---which produce on pollution. Each citizen is allotted {{a small amount of}} daily water, and they are meticulous in their conservation of water. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> urine <b>and</b> sweat are recycled and kept in a personal water bottle.|$|R
50|$|At home, Julia sees Olivia, first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> mirror <b>and</b> then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{living room}} {{playing with the}} clown toy.

25|$|A further {{search for}} {{additional}} remains at 23 Cranley Gardens on 10 February revealed the lower {{section of a}} torso and two legs stowed in a bag <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> a skull, a section of a torso, and various bones in the tea chest. The same day, Nilsen accompanied police to Melrose Avenue, where he indicated the three locations in the rear garden where he had burned the remains of his victims (investigators would discover over 1,000 fragments of bone from the garden at Melrose Avenue, many of them blackened and charred by fire).|$|E
25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, as {{she headed}} to a union {{negotiation}} meeting, Silkwood again {{tested positive for}} plutonium, although she had performed only paperwork duties that morning. She was given a more intensive decontamination. On November 7, {{as she entered the}} plant, she was found to be dangerously contaminated, even expelling contaminated air from her lungs. A health physics team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> the refrigerator. When the house was later stripped and decontaminated, some of her property had to be destroyed. Silkwood, her boyfriend Drew Stephens, and her roommate Dusty Ellis, were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory for in-depth testing {{to determine the extent of}} the contamination in their bodies.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} heating and {{ventilation}} system for the ‘Emotivní dům’ which was designed by the author of this thesis. The first part of the thesis provides an overview of the project and the architectural design of <b>the</b> house. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> next part, the calculation of the heat loss and the design of the heating and ventilation system is described. War-air heating/ventilation is used <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> habitable rooms of the house with the hydronic system utilized <b>in</b> other spaces. <b>The</b> floor heating is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other non-habitable spaces, such as the garage, are heated with radiators. A natural gas boiler is used as a heat source for both space heating and domestic hot water heating. The thesis contains the floor plans of the house as well as technical drawings of the heating and ventilation system...|$|R
50|$|The Sailors of Rodney M. Davis {{completed}} their third community relations (COMEL) project in Panama City, Panama on 3 April 2007. During the ship’s three-day port visit, 21 {{members of the}} crew spent a day helping to improve Hogar Nuevo Pacto, a home for abused children <b>in</b> Panama City. <b>The</b> crew raised $1,100 in donations to pay for supplies and improvements for the home. Rodney M. Davis sailors bought equipment to repaint {{the inside of the}} house, as well as groceries, new shower curtains, bed sheets, and light fixtures for the children’s living areas. The home, previously U.S. military housing, was greatly in need of some modernization and assistance from able hands. Despite rainy weather outside, the crew spent the day productively inside, painting hallways and bedrooms, installing conveniences like toilet paper dispensers <b>and</b> toothbrush holders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms,</b> <b>and</b> replacing lights and correcting electrical safety problems.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} was premiered through Vevo on September 24. The music video {{takes place in}} a high school; it begins with the school {{principal}} leaving his office, which Mike Will Made It enters and begins playing [...] "23" [...] on a Beats Pill over the intercom. Interspersed throughout are scenes of Cyrus wearing a bikini similar to Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls basketball jersey; she is frequently shown smoking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> writing on its mirrors with red lipstick. Khalifa raps his verse in a chemistry lab, while Juicy J's verse is rapped in a trophy room. A school-wide pep rally later takes place, where Cyrus is gyrating against Mike Will Made It and notably wearing the foam finger used in her controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August.|$|E
500|$|On an {{airplane}} in flight, scientist Marshall Bowman (Neal Huff) gets a nosebleed, and {{he tries to}} warn the crew to give him sedatives or use force against him. He transforms into a beast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> bursts out, causing the plane to crash in Scarsdale, New York. The Fringe team arrives {{on the scene and}} discover the beast's body. Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) concludes that it started out as a human. Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) recognizes Bowman's picture from John Scott's (Mark Valley) memories, realizing that Bowman was flying to meet another man in the memories named Daniel Hicks (Felix Solis). Back at the lab at Harvard, Walter finds a small crystalline disc implanted in the beast's hand similar to one seen inside the woman killed in [...] "The Ghost Network", and thinks Marshall was dosed with a [...] "designer virus".|$|E

Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
500|$|In the video, Lohan hides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> prays a rosary as her parents, Michael and Dina (played by Drake Andrew and Victoria Hay, respectively), argue {{and fight}} in the living room. Her sister, Ali (who plays herself, {{according}} to Lohan), goes to her bedroom after coming home from ballet class, breaks into tears, saying a rosary. The three rooms are shown behind a department store window, outside which a crowd of observers form. At {{the end of the}} video, Lohan stands behind the glass and photographs of memories fly up onto it, from which she breaks out. As a response to the video, Lindsay's father {{wrote a letter to the}} New York Daily News, saying, [...] "while I always considered and expressed how truly blessed Lindsay, as well as my other children are, I never realized how blessed I am to have a daughter as amazing as Lindsay.

500|$|Metcalfe told Katy Moon from Inside Soap that {{to forget}} about the {{situation}} Mercedes [...] "wants to feel numb" [...] and as a means of [...] "escape" [...] she called Doctor Browning, which left her feeling [...] "awful". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes was in [...] "self destruct mode" [...] and she [...] "hates herself" [...] for having sex with Doctor Browning, although she does not take money this time. Metcalfe justified Mercedes' actions by saying Mercedes was [...] "looking for any distraction, any way to escape her demons". Metcalfe told a journalist from The Sun's magazine TV Buzz that Mercedes believes Doctor Browning [...] "will help her move on" [...] with her ordeal. Mercedes took a business man back to her hotel room where [...] "things end badly"; she locked herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> refused to come out.

Discovering David's body, Sally faints and impales herself on Mark's {{clarinet}} stand, killing her too. Realizing the absurdity of four consecutive, fatal accidents occurring in one place, Pierce concocts a plan to move Jack's body to an alternative location, as they both had a strong motive to murder him. Shooing Sally's father when he arrives, a police officer (O'Sullivan) then arrives due to an unrelated noise complaint, causing Pierce to panic and take her hostage.|$|R
50|$|Accommodation is {{available}} {{inside the park}} or outside near the headquarters. Sabah Parks has privatised Mount Kinabalu activities to an organisation called Sutera Sanctuary Lodges. The mountain may be climbed on a single day trip, or hikers may (usually) stay one night at Laban Rata Resthouse at 3270 m to complete <b>the</b> climb <b>in</b> 2 days, finishing the ascent and descending on the second day. The majority of climbers begin the ascent on day one of a two-day hike from Timpohon gate at 1866 m, reaching this location either by minibus or by walking, and then walk to Laban Rata. Most people accomplish this part of <b>the</b> climb <b>in</b> 3 to 6 hours. Since there are no roads, the supplies for the Laban Rata Resthouse are carried by porters, who sometimes bring more than 35 kilograms of supplies on their backs. Hot food and beverages are available at Laban Rata. Most rooms have no hot water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>and</b> whilst <b>the</b> dining area is heated, most rooms are not. The last 2 km, from the Laban Rata Resthouse at 3270 m to Low's Peak (summit) at 4095.2 m, takes between 2 and 4 hours. The {{last part of the}} climb is on bare granite rock.|$|R
5|$|Mulder {{calls the}} medical {{examiner}} who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle Parker back to the ranch and that Parker's blood test has revealed his father's blood type in his stomach. Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> sick, <b>and</b> then they were attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion {{is still in its}} cage.|$|R
500|$|Inspired {{partially}} by Debra, {{and partially}} by {{his desire to}} be a better family man than Arthur, Dexter considers giving up killing people. After convincing his wife Rita (Julie Benz) to go safely out of town, Dexter searches for Arthur, eventually tracking him down and capturing him. Dexter insists he is not like Arthur, but Arthur insists they are both the same. Right before he is killed with a framing hammer, Arthur tells Dexter [...] "It's already over." [...] Disposing of Arthur's body on his boat afterwards, Dexter comes to realize that his love for his family is starting to outweigh his need to kill, and he begins to hope for a future without killing. But upon returning home, he finds a message from Rita that she came home from the airport because she forgot her identification. Dexter returns her phone call, only to find that Rita's cell phone and bags are in the house. Dexter hears Harrison crying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> finds Rita dead in the bathtub. Harrison sits in a pool of Rita's blood on the bathroom floor, in the same manner that Dexter was left in a pool of his mother's blood during his youth, which gave Dexter his murderous tendencies.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December David Smith, then 38, also {{returned}} to the moor. He spent about four hours helping police pinpoint areas where he thought more bodies might be buried. Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, I believe, she told me just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Susan {{developed}} retrograde amnesia. The storyline saw Susan slip on some spilt {{milk and}} sustain a minor head injury. After {{she goes to}} sleep, she wakes up and has lost three decades of her life. Woodburne told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison that Susan believes the year is 1972 and the night before was her sixteenth birthday, where she drank too much champagne. She does not recognise her house and thinks she passed out and ended up somewhere else. Susan's family {{take her to the}} hospital, where she is diagnosed with retrograde amnesia. Karl becomes determined to tell her the truth about her condition, while her nephew, Darcy (Mark Raffety), insists they treat her [...] "with kid gloves." [...] Woodburne revealed [...] "Susan keeps asking when she's going to be allowed home to see her parents, and eventually Karl breaks the news - her parents are long dead and she's actually 45, not 16 as she believes. And on top of that, Karl is her husband!" [...] Susan turns to her daughter Libby – who she believes is her sister Carmel (Kirsty Child) – for comfort. But when Libby confirms what Karl has told her, Susan leaves the hospital. Susan spots some students in Seventies clothes and she follows them to a Seventies themed party at Erinsborough High. However, the students recognise Susan as their principal, which distresses her. Susan ends up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> she sees herself in the mirror {{for the first time since}} the accident, and is shocked to see a middle-aged woman staring back at her.|$|E
