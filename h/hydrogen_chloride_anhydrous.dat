40|$|Wheat gluten may be {{dispersed}} virtually {{completely in}} 0. 01 N solution of hydrochloric acid in 70 % aqueous 2 -chloroethanol, {{from which it}} may be recovered by precipitation with diethyl ether with its properties apparently unaltered. A 0. 1 N solution of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> in <b>anhydrous</b> chloroethanol also disperses wheat gluten completely, {{but there is some}} loss of amide nitrogen and some of the free carboxyl groups become esterified. After precipitation with diethyl ether the cohesive properties of the gluten are lost. Anhydrous acid chloroethanol may be used also in the direct extraction of the proteins from wheat and rye flour, but is less effective in the extraction of barley and oat proteins. The extraction of the protein from the germ flour of the carob bean (Ceratonia siliqua) is still less complete. Acid-free anhydrous chloroethanol disperses about 60 % of wheat gluten. Aqueous acid chloroethanol is about as efficient as anhydrous acid chloroethanol for wheat but extracts more oat flour protein. The intrinsic (bulk) viscosity of gluten dispersed in aqueous acid chloroethanol is much higher than that of gluten dispersed in anhydrous acid chloroethanol, but the reverse is true in regard to the limiting surface viscosities of gluten spread from these dispersions at an oil/water interface...|$|R
50|$|In {{solution}} the fluorosulfate anion {{is completely}} ionised. The volume is 47.8 cm3/mol. Nearly every metal ion and quaternary ammonium ions can form a salt with flourosulfate. Different {{ways to make}} these salts include treating a metal <b>chloride</b> with <b>anhydrous</b> fluorosulfuric acid, which releases <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> gas. Double decomposition methods with a metal sulfate with barium fluorosulfate, or a metal chloride with silver fluorosulfate, leave the metal salt in solution.|$|R
50|$|All of the {{hydrogen}} halides are irritants. Hydrogen fluoride and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> are highly acidic. Hydrogen fluoride is used as an industrial chemical, and is highly toxic, causing pulmonary edema and damaging cells. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is also a dangerous chemical. Breathing in gas with more than fifty parts per million of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> can cause death in humans. Hydrogen bromide is even more toxic and irritating than <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride.</b> Breathing in gas with more than thirty parts per million of hydrogen bromide can be lethal to humans.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{performed}} {{experiments to}} determine the embedded <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> (HCI) and smoke particle characteristics during combustion of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and chlorinated mine materials for development of a test parameter. The experiments were conducted in an approximately 20 -L furnace at set furnace temperatures of 25020 and 1, 00020 C, for a 14 -min duration, with an airflow through the furnace of 10 L/min. The variables studied, {{as a function of}} time, were <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> embedded on smoke particles, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> concentrations in the gas phase, smoke particle average diameter (dg) and particle concentration (no), and product of smoke particle diameter and concentration (dgno).

Results show that there is a correlation between embedded <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> gas concentrations, and inverse of the smoke particle diameter-concentration product (1 /dgno); the higher the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> gas concentrations, the higher the embedded <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride,</b> the higher the 1 /(dgno) values.

25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a negative azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the residue being closer in composition to the azeotrope than the original mixture. For example, if a hydrochloric acid solution contains less than 20.2% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride,</b> boiling the mixture will leave behind a solution that is richer in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> than the original. If the solution initially contains more than 20.2% <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride,</b> then boiling will leave behind a solution that is poorer in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> than the original. Boiling of any hydrochloric acid solution long enough will cause the solution left behind to approach the azeotropic ratio.|$|R

40|$|The {{combustion}} toxicology of polyvinylchloride (PVC) {{has been}} studied exten-sively {{against a background of}} increasing understanding of the relevance of the toxicity of combustion products in fires. Most materials have a similar toxic potency and demonstrate asphyxia and irritancy when thermally decomposed. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is a major toxicant produced by PVC, which accounts for the irritancy shown by PVC combustion products. Carbon monoxide is also pro-duced which becomes the most significant toxicant if the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> levels are reduced, which can occur rapidly in fires. The toxic potency lies within the range of 300 - 3000 mg/l. mins, which is similar to the majority of polymeric materials whether natural or synthetic. The toxicity of PVC can be accounted for in hazard estimation either by an assumed toxic potency based on weight loss calculations or by predicting the concentrations of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> and carbon monoxide. The toxicology of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> has been well studied and has been overestimated in the past and codes using toxicity factors for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> should be revised i...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> detector designed to monitor concentrations of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> {{gas in the}} ambient environment. The detector was developed for NASA for use in launch vehicle effluent monitoring. The detector operates on chemiluminescence principles with a lower detection limit of less than 5 x 10 to the - 3 rd ppm (by volume). The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> in the air sample reacts with a bromide-bromate coating in the inlet tube of the instrument producing bromine. Bromine is then quantitated by chemiluminescent oxidation of luminol. The visible light generated in the chemiluminescent reaction {{is proportional to the}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration of the sampled airstream. The detector is most suited to laboratory or field studies where <b>hydrogen</b> <b>chloride</b> is the dominant pollutant, as compared to the interfering species. Interferences include strong acids, acid-forming gases, and halogen gases. Of the interferences investigated the most serious in these groups are hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, and chlorine, respectively.
