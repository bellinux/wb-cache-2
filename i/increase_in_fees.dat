40|$|This study {{considers}} the time series relationship between bank fee income and bank net interest margins in Australia, applying panel vector autoregressions to a unique, hand-collected dataset. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> bank <b>fee</b> income {{are being used}} to supplement decreases in net interest margins. The <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> magnitude of <b>fee</b> income associated with reductions in margin income is smaller than the decrease in net interest margins, resulting in a net wealth transfer favouring users of bank services; although not all users of bank services gained and/or gained equally. The overall <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> income is marginally greater that the reduction in margin income. It is argued that banks have responded to falling margin revenue by increasing their range of fee-based services, especially insurance. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> income are found to pre-date declines in margin income, thus Australian banks were pro-active in the process of disintermediation...|$|R

Judge Merryday scrutinized the 11,251 billable hours submitted by Cohen and associates and subtracted only 310 hours from the total. Cohen argued that because of the complexity of the case and its successful outcome, the rate of billable hours should be multiplied by three. (That is a standard practice in civil cases.) The judge declined to multiply the fees but agreed that a substantial <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> was warranted in this case, setting an important precedent, as an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> had never previously been allowed in a Hyde Amendment case.|$|E

40|$|June 1998 (Revised) Concerns {{about the}} health of poor {{children}} and mothers produced major changes in the Medicaid public insurance program during the last decade, including expansions in program eligibility and <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> paid to physicians who care for covered patients. We examine physician responses to Medicaid policy changes aimed at improving care for pregnant women {{in order to understand the}} effects of Medicaid policy on physician behavior as well as to study the effectiveness of the expansions in improving access to care. We find that expanded eligibility for Medicaid did increase access to physician services. However, contrary to the findings of some previous studies, <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> access are only apparent for the physicians in "public" institutions such as public clinics and hospital clinics; we find no evidence that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> eligibility <b>increase</b> access to the physicians in our sample who are based in private offices. Our evidence also suggests that the impact of fees on physician behavior may be smaller than previous estimates would imply. We find that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> are associated with <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> service to poor populations by these young private physicians, but some of this increase simply reflects shifting of patients from "public" sites to private physician offices. ...|$|R

50|$|Cable {{companies}} {{are required by}} the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act to negotiate for retransmission consent, usually paying broadcasters {{for the right to}} carry their signals. This provision, over time, has resulted in problems between pay television providers and companies that own subscription television services as well as those own and/or operate over-the-air television stations, as disagreements over terms in retransmission contracts sometimes arise during negotiations to renew and (occasionally) strike new agreements to carry certain channels. The carriage disputes that occur because of these differences typically result in broadcast stations or cable channels being pulled for a protracted period of time, often due to carriage fee increases that a provider may consider to be too expensive (since retransmission consent fees are a form of subscriber fee, any <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>fees</b> that a provider carries will be passed on to the subscriber, which providers are hesitant to do out of concern that it may result in subscriber defections due to the resulting rate increases for program packages).|$|E
