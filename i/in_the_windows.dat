This allows a computer user to view notifications from their phone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> 10 Action Center. The feature was announced in early 2016 and released later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder, {{the player}} assumes {{the roles of}} the main protagonist Chihaya Kisakinomiya and the {{secondary}} character Kaoruko Nanahara. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In the adult versions of Futari no Elder, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Chihaya and a given heroine having sex. The gameplay is somewhat altered in the PSP version. The PSP version has the sexual content removed, the scenarios of Utano Sasou and Kaori Kamichika that appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> version are removed, and it contains newly added scenarios of You Kashiwagi and Hatsune Minase. There are three additional sub episodes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> version of Futari no Elder.|$|E

In September, the Chinese government chose Windows to be the operating system of choice in that country, and entered into {{an agreement with the}} company to standardize a Chinese version of the operating system. Microsoft also released the Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro joystick in an attempt to further expand its profile in the computer hardware market.|$|E
5|$|Joyce concocted {{a number}} of money-making schemes during this period, {{including}} an attempt to become a cinema magnate in Dublin. He frequently discussed but ultimately abandoned a plan to import Irish tweed to Trieste. Correspondence relating to that venture with the Irish Woollen Mills were {{for a long time}} displayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of their premises in Dublin. Joyce's skill at borrowing money saved him from indigence. What income he had came partially from his position at the Berlitz school and partially from teaching private students.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Bodewryd {{is a small}} medieval {{church in}} the hamlet of Bodewryd, in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of {{construction}} is unknown, {{but there was a}} church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date can be given is a doorway in a 15th-century style dating to around 1500. When the church was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning, stained glass with Islamic-influenced patterns was included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley, the church's benefactor, who was a convert to Islam.|$|E

5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, {{black ink}} was thrown on Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently out of town {{at the time and}} put black drapes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very quickly through the building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E

5|$|Cortana can {{no longer}} be fully hidden, as it was made the default search {{experience}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> shell for all users (on previous revisions, a generic search experience without any Cortana branding and functionality is used if it is disabled). As with previous builds, users must still opt-in and grant permission for the software to perform data collection and tracking in order to fully enable Cortana's personalized features. If this functionality is not enabled, Cortana operates in a feature-limited mode with basic web and device search functionality, nearly identical to the non-Cortana search experience on previous builds.|$|E
5|$|In the PlayStation 2 version, {{there are}} nine plot lines that the player will {{have the chance to}} experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri, who share the same plot line. This is {{expanded}} to ten plot lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara's scenario, and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio's scenario. In order to view all of the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in alternate directions. In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days scenario in To Heart 2 Another Days, which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of the Sisters of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E

5|$|Since GNOME 3.2 Web allows {{creating}} application launchers for web applications. The subsequent {{invocation of}} a launcher {{brings up a}} plain single instance of Web limited to one domain, with off-site links opening in a normal browser. The launcher created this way is accessible from the desktop and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|E
5|$|Steam for OS X was {{originally}} planned for release in April 2010; it was launched worldwide on May 12, 2010, following a successful beta period. In {{addition to the}} Steam client, several features were made available to developers, allowing them {{to take advantage of}} the cross-platform Source engine, and platform and network capabilities using Steamworks. Through SteamPlay, the OS X client allows players who have purchased compatible products <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> version to download the Mac versions at no cost, allowing them to continue playing the game on the other platform. Some third-party titles may require the user to re-purchase them to gain access to the cross-platform functionality. The Steam Cloud is cross-platform compatible. Multiplayer games can also be cross-compatible, allowing Windows and Mac players to play with each other.|$|E
5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the tracery is Geometric or Curvilinear. Many cathedrals have important {{parts in the}} Geometric style of the mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of tracery evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes as can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> of the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E

5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The online {{multiplayer}} mode for Grand Theft Auto IV allows up to 32 {{players to}} freely roam across a recreation of the single-player world. Players decide which game mode that {{they wish to}} play, including deathmatches and street races. Both cooperative and competitive game modes are available. These game modes are split into ranked and unranked matches. For players to level up through ranks, in-game money must be earned. The game also features a Free Mode, in which players have the entire map open to explore, with no end goal or mission to complete. Hosts of the game can control many variables, such as police presence, traffic, and weapons. LAN support is available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> version of the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows)</b> point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor.|$|E
