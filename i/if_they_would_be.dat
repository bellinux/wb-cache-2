5|$|At an {{editorial}} meeting of Jyllands-Posten ("The Jutland Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted {{the idea of}} asking {{the members of the}} newspaper illustrators union <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> willing to draw Muhammad. This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning life as The Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{interested in him}} pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, {{but by the time}} Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E

25|$|In 1996 {{the late}} Gene Sandberg invited Christina Gill, Jeannette Oatman, {{and the late}} Vera Adams, for a luncheon at Rickeys Hyatt House in Palo Alto.

5000|$|According to Knowlson and John Pilling in Frescoes of the Skull: {{the later}} prose and drama of Samuel Beckett, “The three figures in Play … are not {{three-dimensional}} characters. Any attempt to analyse them as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> absurd. The stereotype predominates … They belong … to the artificial world of melodrama and romance embodied in romanticized fiction.” ...|$|R

25|$|The halakha {{requires}} {{eating and}} traditionally {{sleeping in the}} sukkah. However, Jews {{are not expected to}} remain in the sukkah <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very uncomfortable there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the cold temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep.|$|E
25|$|As this prudent economy, {{which some}} people call Saving, is in private {{families}} the most certain method to increase an estate, so some imagine that, whether a country be barren or fruitful, the same method if generally pursued (which they think practicable) {{will have the same}} effect upon a whole nation, and that, for example, the English might be much richer than they are, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as frugal as some of their neighbours. This, I think, is an error.|$|E
25|$|While {{the career}} field was still young {{and lacking in}} {{manpower}} from so little Army pathfinder transfers, Air Force headquarters solicited from radio maintenance career field for more Combat Controllers. It was also stipulated that Combat Controllers would have to attend air traffic control school <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> controlling aircraft from the ground. Because of their job, Combat Controllers had to have either an air traffic control AFSC or a radio maintenance AFSC in addition to jump school to become a Combat Controller. This gave rise to blousing trousers and wearing paratrooper boots, a tradition that still exists to the present.|$|E

25|$|The {{initiative}} {{to build an}} airport in Røros was taken {{by a group of}} individuals in 1954, with Olav Bergersen as the most enthusiastic. They contacted Braathens SAFE and asked if they were interested in operating flights out of the town. The airline had recently gained the right to fly between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, and was therefore asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interested in making a stop-over for some of their services in Røros. Ludvig G. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Notodden.|$|E
25|$|Her sister {{liked the}} book and {{encouraged}} Meyer to send the manuscript to literary agencies. Of the 15 letters she wrote, five went unanswered, nine brought rejections, and the last was a positive response from Jodi Reamer of Writers House. Meyer had merely sent out letters to literary agents inquiring <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interested in a 130,000-word manuscript about teenage vampires. Luck helped. An inexperienced assistant at Writers House responded to her inquiry, not knowing that young adult books {{are expected to be}} about 40,000 to 60,000 words in length. Due to that error, Reamer eventually read Meyer's manuscript and signed her up as a client. During the editing process, a chapter that used to be Chapter 20 was cut out of the manuscript along with Emmett's account of his bear attack and some parts of the epilogue.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish court's {{decision}} {{to grant the}} two critics access to the data was controversial. When the study participants were contacted by Gillberg and asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prepared to have the data released, all but one family refused. Citing that, {{and the promise of}} confidentiality given to the participants as a precondition, Gillberg and the other researchers decided to not turn over the personal data. 267 Swedish doctors signed a letter in support of Gillberg's {{decision to}} not hand over the data. After the verdict, the chairman of the Central Ethical Review Board of Sweden, Johan Munch, said that in Swedish legislation, the Principle of Public Access is incompatible with promises of absolute confidentiality, and that the Central Ethical Review Board therefore no longer approves such promises. According to Martin Ingvar of the Karolinska Institute, medical researchers in Sweden will be forced to change the current practice because of the verdict. Ingvar told media that medical studies in Sweden must now adhere to a strict anonymization encoding, even in extensive studies like Gillberg's which contain large amounts of clinical material collected over long periods of time, in spite of the increase in cost and the larger margins of error.|$|E

A few turned him down, including Elvis Costello and David Bowie, and a well-known group Boyle has not named [...] "wanted £20,000 and would not budge", {{and so they were}} not used.

500|$|Flynn {{believes}} {{the band was}} naive {{about the length of}} songs, and was unconcerned <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> suitable for radio or MTV, as the band purposely did not want to receive airplay.

This was to make the song not suitable for airplay as the band wanted to make a [...] "dark epic record".|$|E
