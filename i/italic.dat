5|$|Bembo's <b>italic</b> is {{not based}} {{directly}} {{on the work of}} Griffo, but on the work of calligrapher and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio). He published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing, in Venice in 1524, after the time of Manutius and Griffo, with engravings and some text set in an <b>italic</b> typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. (Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting, but also self-help guides on learning to read, arithmetic, embroidery and a book of model love letters.) It too was imitated in France, with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards. Another influential <b>italic</b> type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, also a calligrapher who became involved in printing. His almost upright <b>italic</b> design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth-century font designs.|$|E

5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the <b>italic</b> script. The <b>italic</b> script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning of}} the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the <b>italic</b> script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, Manutius {{released}} the first books printed using <b>italic</b> type, again designed by Griffo. This was originally not {{intended as a}} complementary design, as is used today, but rather as an alternative, more informal typeface suitable for small volumes.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>italic,</b> the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut <b>italic</b> capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} {{are influenced by}} the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly in <b>italic.</b> An engraver with a long and wide-ranging career, Granjon’s work seems to have ranged much more widely than Garamond’s focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type in <b>italic,</b> civilité (a cursive blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold <b>italic</b> (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and <b>italic</b> of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below the baseline of the text.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an <b>italic</b> type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and <b>italic</b> swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E
5|$|Symbols {{are written}} in upright (Roman) type (m for metres, s for seconds), so as to {{differentiate}} from the <b>italic</b> type used for quantities (m for mass, s for displacement). By consensus of international standards bodies, this rule is applied independent of the font used for surrounding text.|$|E
5|$|A major {{professional}} competitor to Bembo is Agmena, {{created by}} Jovica Veljović and released by Linotype in 2014. Intended {{as a unified}} serif design supporting Roman, Greek {{and a range of}} Cyrillic alphabets such as Serbian, it features a more calligraphic <b>italic</b> than Bembo with swash capitals and support for Greek ligatures.|$|E
5|$|An {{open-source}} {{adaptation of}} Garamond intended for display sizes, designed by Christian Thalmann and co-released with Google Fonts. It features a delicate style suitable for printing at larger sizes, and considerable contrast in stroke weight in its larger sizes. Thalmann added several unusual alternate designs {{such as an}} upright <b>italic</b> and unicase styles, as well as exaggerated, highly slanting accents.|$|E
5|$|In the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of 1906, {{the lion}} and sun motif in {{the flag of}} Iran was {{described}} as a passant lion that holds a saber in its paw and with the sun in its background. A decree dated September 4, 1910 specified the exact details of the logo, including the lion's tail ("like an <b>italic</b> S"), the position {{and the size of the}} lion, his paw, the sword, and the sun.|$|E
5|$|<b>Italic</b> text {{indicates}} the current {{name of a}} current Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise; names not in italics indicate either defunct teams or defunct team names. Teams are listed only as major league squads; minor league teams promoted into MLB do not have minor league names or tenures listed. Initial table sorting is by number of cycles hit per franchise and then by ratio of cycles hit to cycles allowed.|$|E
5|$|Monotype created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. Monotype also created a second, much more eccentric <b>italic</b> for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank, which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E
5|$|Monotype has {{released}} two separate digitisations named Bembo {{and more recently}} Bembo Book, {{as well as the}} more slender caps-only display font Bembo Titling and the alternate <b>italic</b> design Fairbank. Bembo Book is considered to be superior by being thicker and more suitable for body text, as well as for offering the alternate shorter R for better-spaced body text.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{well-known}} executive Stanley Morison {{wrote in}} his memoir that the <b>italic</b> was based on Granjon's work, but as Carter's annotations of it note, this seems generally to be a mistake. The swash capitals, however, at least, probably {{are based on the}} work of Granjon. Some publicity art for it in the metal period was created by a young Rodney Peppé.|$|E
5|$|More loosely, Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier {{is similar}} in some ways. Released in 1968 and praised by Tschichold, it was {{intended}} to be a more dynamic, handwriting-influenced sans-serif form. Its <b>italic</b> is, however, more of an oblique than Gill's. Hypatia Sans, designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe, was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design. Many other fonts are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent.|$|E
5|$|Note: {{station and}} route details are {{confined}} to those opened during GPK days, and the subsequent history of those stations and routes; details of stations opened on the route later than 1850, and of contiguous routes opened later, {{can be found in}} the Glasgow and South Western Railway article. Locations in <b>italic</b> were not passenger stations; entries in bold are passenger stations open at the present.|$|E
5|$|The NAIT 5si is the {{entry-level}} NAIT and {{the direct}} {{replacement of the}} NAIT 5i (with <b>italic</b> 'i'); the NAIT XS 2 is positioned as the mid-range product. The SUPERNAIT 2, the flagship integrated amplifier in the Naim stable individually decoupled inputs and no digital circuitry. Both incorporate a headphone output via a class-A headphone amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of Latin among the literate elite may obscure {{the continuity of}} spoken languages, since all cultures within the Roman Empire were predominantly oral. In the West, Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and <b>Italic</b> languages that were related to it by a shared Indo-European origin. Commonalities in syntax and vocabulary facilitated the adoption of Latin.|$|E
5|$|The {{show has}} {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} perpetuating negative stereotypes about Italian Americans. Several major organizations have voiced their concern that The Sopranos presents a very distorted and harmful stereotype of Italian Americans and their cultural values, including the National Italian American Foundation, Order Sons of Italy in America, Unico National, and the <b>Italic</b> Institute of America.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In <b>italic</b> the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, {{the written}} use of Latin had {{replaced}} Oscan—like Latin, an <b>Italic</b> language—and Etruscan {{by the end}} of the 1st century AD. Oscan graffiti are preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD at Pompeii, which was in the Oscan region, and a couple may date after the earlier eruption in 63. In the mid-1st century, the emperor Claudius, who had keen antiquarian interests, knew Etruscan and wrote a multivolume history of the Etruscans, but the work has not survived.|$|E
5|$|In September 1952, {{the first}} major NATO {{maritime}} exercises began; Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway. Other major exercises that followed included Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise Longstep, naval and amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean Sea, <b>Italic</b> Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy, Grand Repulse, involving the British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE), Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the Central Army Group, and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American, British, Greek, Italian and Turkish naval forces.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a long-standing}} {{practice}} of writing transliterations of the runes in Latin characters in boldface and transcribing the text into a normalized {{form of the}} language with <b>italic</b> type. This practice exists because the two forms of rendering a runic text have to be kept distinct. By not only showing the original inscription, but also transliterating, transcribing and translating, scholars present the analysis {{in a way that}} allows the reader to follow their interpretation of the runes. Every step presents challenges, but most Younger Futhark inscriptions are considered easy to interpret.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the {{recognized}} moons of the planets and of the largest dwarf planets of the Solar System. The 19 moons that are large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity are listed in bold. The seven largest moons, which are larger than any of the known dwarf planets, are listed in bold and <b>italic.</b> Sidereal period differs from semi-major axis because it depends on the mass of the primary as well as the satellite's distance from it.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Monotype's current {{digitisation}} of Gill Sans is Gill Sans Nova, by George Ryan. Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants, {{including some}} of the previously undigitised inline versions, stylistic alternates and an ultra-light weight (once an option in metal type) which had been digitised for Grazia. The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default, while the regular weight is renamed 'Medium'. Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill's work, as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill's serif design Joanna. One addition was <b>italic</b> swash caps, which had been considered by Gill but never released.|$|E
5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its <b>italic</b> (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its <b>italic,</b> {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp triangular serif at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E
5|$|Sabon is a Garamond revival {{designed}} by Jan Tschichold in 1964, jointly released by Linotype, Monotype and Stempel in 1967. It {{is named after}} Jacques Sabon, a Frankfurt-based printer, who introduced the typefaces of Garamond and his contemporaries to German printing. An unusual feature of many releases of Sabon is that the <b>italic,</b> based on Granjon's work, is wider than most normal italics, at the same width as the roman style. This suited Linotype's hot metal typesetting system. Later Sabon versions, such as Jean François Porchez's Sabon Next, have not always maintained this principle. Porchez and Mosley, as part of Porchez's research into Sabon, suggest that aspects of its design may have been copied from a font by Guillaume Le Bé, a large-size specimen {{of which he had}} previously reproduced in a textbook.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the <b>italic</b> 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{army had}} not yet seen {{elephants}} in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, and again at the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other <b>Italic</b> peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1520 to around 1560, {{encompassing}} Garamond's career, {{was an extremely}} busy period for typeface creation. Many fonts were cut, some such as Robert Estienne’s for a single printer’s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them. Confusion about which engravers created which typefaces is natural since many were active over this time, creating typefaces {{not just in the}} Latin alphabet in roman and <b>italic,</b> but also in Greek and Hebrew for scholarly use. These included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew fonts, Pierre Hautin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond's mentor), Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw the creation of a pool of high-quality punches and matrices that would supply the French and European printing industry, to a large extent, for the next two centuries.|$|E
