60|$|And how did {{the first}} Watt or Edison of {{metallurgy}} come to make that earliest bronze implement? Well, it seems probable that between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age there intervened everywhere, or nearly everywhere, a very short and transient age of copper. And the reason for thus thinking is threefold. In the first place, bronze is an alloy of tin and copper: and it seems natural to suppose that men would use the simple metals in isolation to begin with, before they discovered that they could <b>harden</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper</b> them by mixing the two together. In the second place, copper occurs in the pure or native state (without the trouble of smelting) in several countries, and was therefore a very natural metal for early man to cast his inquiring glance upon. And in the third place, weapons of unmixed copper, apparently of very antique types, {{have been found in}} various parts of the world, both in Asia and America. According to Mr. John Evans, the most learned historian of the Bronze Age, the greatest copper 'find' of the eastern hemisphere was that at Gungeria, in Central India; and the copper implements there found consisted entirely of flat celts of a very early and almost primitive pattern.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{most people}} cannot {{determine}} if steel has undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process by simply looking at it, {{there is a}} reliable and simple test. When examining a piece of steel, obtain a hand file and file an edge of the selected metal. If the piece of steel has not undergone the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process, the metal file should easily 'bite' into the sample. If the metal has been hardened, the file fails to cut into the sample and glances off with little visible effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nanoparticle}} addition on the <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> 20 MnCr steel have been investigated. Addition of oxide nanoparticles to the melt, {{through a new}} technology that ensures safe handling, was found to give as <b>hardened</b> steel hardness <b>and</b> tensile properties close {{to those of the}} conventional steel in the <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> condition. This has the potential to eliminate the tempering step in component production, with benefits for process efficiency. The effects on microstructure, hardness and tensile properties depend on the type and concentration of the nanoparticles added. The reduced tensile strength and hardness, and increased ductility, of the steels with nanoparticle additions are attributed to the presence of retained ferrite in these microstructures, in both the <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> condition. It is proposed that the application of this approach at an industrial scale has the potential to reduce energy consumption, cost and time in component production through the elimination of intermediate operations such as tempering...|$|R
5000|$|The {{addition}} of {{large amounts of}} nickel and chromium needed for corrosion resistance in stainless steels means that traditional <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> methods are not effective. However, precipitates of chromium, copper, or other elements can strengthen the steel by similar amounts in comparison to <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> The strength can be tailored by adjusting the annealing process, with lower initial temperatures resulting in higher strengths. The lower initial temperatures increase {{the driving force of}} nucleation. More driving force means more nucleation sites, and more sites means more places for dislocations to be disrupted while the finished part is in use.|$|R

Wear rate was found to initially decrease and then remain constant with sliding distance in all the materials, it being least for the specimen <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> to similar to 40 HRC, Optical microscopy was performed to characterise the basic microstructures associated with different heat treatments. SEM observations of the worn surface revealed plastic deformation with delamination of surface layers by subsurface cracks as the mechanism in the as-sintered condition.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} on the abrasive wear behavior of high chromium cast iron (NF 253 AHT) under dry sliding condition has been investigated. Rectangular cross sectioned {{samples of the}} alloy were produced by sand casting. After casting, the samples were machined to equal dimensions of 50 mm x 15 mm x 10 mm and heat treated by annealing, <b>hardening</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> Abrasive wear tests were carried out on the samples using the pin-on-disc wear test. The tests were carried out under restricted values of speed, load and time. Within this limit, the hardened sample displayed a superior wear resistance, while the annealed sample displayed the weakest wear resistance. A graphical model (wear map) displaying all the wear regimes of the alloy, which {{may serve as a}} wear predictive tool was subsequently developed from the results of the wear tests. With the exception of the as-cast and annealed specimen, all other specimens (<b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered)</b> have functioned adequately in wear prone environment, but with different degree of effectiveness. Hence, the <b>hardened</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> samples can be used in shot blast equipments and in the grinding of minerals...|$|R

Especially for large sectioned starter ring gears (in this case diameter of the gear is 470 mm) the critical issue is to maintain a stable hardness distribution on gear cross sections.

Increase in tact time in process, decrease in labor efficiency due to scrap rate and excessive hardness measurements. 3. Potential risk of failure on engine in low mileages. 4. 100 % hardness measurements in ongoing process which leads to time and cost waste.
