5|$|Presently, most {{armed forces}} are {{composed}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds. They {{are considered to be}} polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background. While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic {{armed forces are}} not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in existence since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans. The U.S. Military {{was one of the first}} modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of President Truman in 1945.|$|E

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.

5|$|As British offshoots, the Australian colonies {{participated in}} Britain's small {{wars of the}} 19th century, while later as a federated dominion, and then an {{independent}} nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, {{as well as in}} the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War. In the Post-Vietnam era Australian <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, through the United Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi-lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly 103,000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of troops {{deployed}} by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać. In late 1994, the Fikret Abdić-led Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia (APWB)a sliver of land northwest of Bihać between its ally RSK and the pocketcommanded 4,0005,000 soldiers who were deployed south of Velika Kladuša against the ARBiH force.|$|E

For reasons unknown, Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished from sight. With the Zerg gone, the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara, Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion, captained by Matt Horner, Raynor's second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{initially}} misguided by Mushu who encourages {{her to go}} to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain {{as the rest of the}} army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor.|$|E
