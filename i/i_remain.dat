But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

In2008, he was writing book about Doris Storey, the winner of two Olympic swimming gold medals at the 1938 British Empire Games in Sydney, Australia. Mr. Harding lived in the Swarcliffe area, {{until his death in}} December, 2013. The Leeds-born musician, Andrew Edge, grew up in the area, attending Swarcliffe School. He used two photographs taken in Swarcliffe, of a sunrise and sunset, for his Northern Sky album in1996(BMG Austria).|$|E

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really? The debate will never be resolved. The American military obviously thinks there's something there: The troubling new TV ad campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant, video-game-styled animation. And, curiously, no one has complained about or tried to ban , in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in Manhunt.|$|E

I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his presidency, Grant was {{continually}} {{concerned with}} {{the civil rights of}} all Americans, [...] "irrespective of nationality, color, or religion." [...] Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 that allowed citizens access to public eating establishments, hotels, and places of entertainment. This was done particularly to protect African Americans who were discriminated across United States. The bill was also passed in honor of Senator Charles Sumner who had previously attempted to pass a civil rights bill in 1872. In his sixth message to Congress, he summed up his own views, [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> Executive all the laws of Congress and the provisions of the Constitution... will be enforced with rigor... Treat the Negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is and must remain... Then we shall have no complaint of sectional interference." [...] In the pursued equal justice for all category from the 2009 CSPAN Presidential rating survey Grant scored a 9 getting into the top ten.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday. The song {{features}} street-slang bravado and [...] "venomous" [...] rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses. The instrumentation in [...] "Freedom" [...] mixes together smooth ambient riffs, pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers, and a smooth R beat, creating a sonically breezy soundscape. Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame. In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers [...] "in the competition" [...] will never thank her for opening the doors for them, and how they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: [...] "They'll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> a staple." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 28, 2010, Rice {{publicly}} {{announced her}} {{disdain for the}} current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, [...] "Today I quit being a Christian.... <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else." [...] Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: [...] "My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become." ...|$|E
500|$|Thorne-Begland {{commented that}} he was [...] "looking forward to {{continuing}} to serve {{the citizens of the}} city of Richmond and the great commonwealth of Virginia" [...] in his role as a prosecutor. A month later, on June 14, the Richmond Circuit Court judges appointed him to the position for which he was rejected by the legislature. The temporary appointment began July 1, 2012, to expire 30 days after the date the next legislative session began. Governor McDonnell's spokesman congratulated Thorne-Begland on the appointment, stating, [...] "the Governor believes Mr. Thorne-Begland is well-qualified to serve on the bench". Marshall called the move [...] "highly imprudent and arrogant" [...] of the judges: [...] "They're contesting the authority of the General Assembly[...] . . This is an act of defiance on their part. When appointed officials get in fights with elected officials, they invariably lose." [...] Thorne-Begland stated that [...] "I look forward to serving the citizens of the City of Richmond as a jurist, and over the coming months, I hope that my service provides comfort to all Virginians that <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> committed to the faithful application of the laws and Constitutions of Virginia and the United States of America." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón's grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was {{presented}} by the city's taxi drivers' union and roughly translates as: [...] "Don't cry for me Argentina, <b>I</b> <b>remain</b> quite near to you." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E
