DC levels were lower: in the monopolar than in the bipolar stimulation condition. Stimulation with a monopolar capacitively coupled <b>extracochlear</b> <b>electrode</b> showed even lower DC levels in the intracochlear. electrodes.

Approximately 10 mm. of the cochlear turns are accessible, being {{less than a third of}} their length. The middle cranial fossa, the facial nerve, the internal carotid artery and the temporomandibular joint restrict the access. A further restriction is caused by the position of the cochlea and the direction of its axis. The anterior part of the cochlea lies anterior to the tympanic membrane and medial to the temporomandibular joint, thus limiting an endaural approach to a posterolateral direction. Despite this limitation small sections of the basal, middle and apical turns of the cochlea can be reached. Open Acces...|$|R

This version is reproduced with permission from Annals Publishing Company. [URL] has been shown that behavioral thresholds in cochlear implant patients are well correlated to the electrically evoked auditory brain stem response (EABR). 1 It is likely, therefore, that the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP), which is closely related to the EABR, will also show a similar correlation with behavioral threshold. Automatic measurement of a patient's ECAP would allow the patient's behavioral threshold level to be set automatically without any conscious input from him or her. It would offer the opportunity to greatly expedite the process of threshold setting and would be particularly useful in the case of young children, whose behavioral threshold levels can be difficult to judge. With this end in mind, an experimental system has been designed that allows the ECAP to be recorded with either scala tympani or <b>extracochlear</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The system, which uses a modified version of a standard cochlear implant, applies a biphasic stimulation pulse and records the ECAP a short time later. The recorded signal is transmitted by telemetry through the implant receiver coil to an external transmitter-receiver coil and is recovered and stored on computer. With the appropriate software it is then a relatively simple matter to determine the details of an evoked response. This paper presents the results of trials of the system on a guinea pig. The experiments were designed to evaluate the parameters to be used to obtain the clearest ECAP signal, with particular regard to the variables stimulating electrode position, stimulating electrode mode (bipolar or monopolar), sensing electrode position, sensing electrode mode, stimulation rate, and artifact cancellation scheme.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effect of two multipolar {{electrode}} configurations on speech perception, pitch perception, and the intracochlear electrical field. STUDY DESIGN: Crossover design; within subject. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eight experienced adult cochlear implant users. INTERVENTION: Each subject used each of three experimental processors for 3 weeks. The following processors were compared that differed only in electrode configuration: 1) monopolar; 2) hybrid quadrupolar, in which half of the current returned to the <b>extracochlear</b> reference <b>electrode</b> and half to two electrodes immediately {{to the left and}} right of the active electrode; and 3) flat tripolar + 2, which directed all the current to four reference electrodes (two on each side), separated from the active electrode by two inactive electrodes. All the processors used the standard Advanced Bionics HiRes speech-processing strategy, 12 channels, 1, 220 pulses per second per channel, and with a pulse width of 33 (micros/phase). RESULTS: The monopolar processors had the largest stimulation efficiency and the smallest dynamic range in linear current units. The reverse was true of flat tripolar + 2 processor, whereas the hybrid quadrupolar processor fell in between. Insufficient loudness growth prevented the use of the flat tripolar + 2 processor in three subjects. Word recognition did not differ between the clinically used 16 -channel monopolar processor and the experimental monopolar processor, regardless of the differences in the number of channels, pulse rate, and duration of experience. Word recognition with the flat tripolar + 2 processor was significantly poorer than with the monopolar and hybrid quadrupolar processors; monopolar and quadrupolar processors did not differ. There was no significant interaction between processor type and competing noise type (stationary or fluctuating), but performance at the higher level of fluctuating noise was best with the hybrid quadrupolar processor in almost all the subjects. Pitch scaling showed ceiling performance in five subjects and differed between processors in the two other subjects with imperfect tonotopy. Intracochlear current spread was considerable with the monopolar configuration; it was reduced with the hybrid quadrupolar configuration and virtually absent beyond the active electrodes with the tripolar configuration. CONCLUSION: More confined configurations reduced the longitudinal width of the electrical field, which was expected to enhance channel separation, but no improvement in word recognition was found. More research is needed to test confined configurations that have enhanced efficiency and to evaluate the fundamental effects of configuration on channel discriminability...|$|R
