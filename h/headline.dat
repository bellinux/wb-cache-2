40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{illuminate}} the differences between Persian and English in online <b>headlines</b> in terms of applying metadiscourse markers in the first two months of the year 2015. To fulfill this purpose, 100 Persian and English online <b>headlines</b> (each 50 <b>headlines)</b> were chosen randomly from English and Persian newscasts such as VOA, CNN, Bistosi (20 : 30), and Bashgahkhabarnegaran.

40|$|Accuracy {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{principles}} of journalism. However, it is increasingly hard to manage due to the diversity of news media. Some editors of online news tend to use catchy <b>headlines</b> which trick readers into clicking. These <b>headlines</b> are either ambiguous or misleading, degrading the reading experience of the audience. Thus, identifying inaccurate news <b>headlines</b> is a task worth studying. Previous work names these <b>headlines</b> "clickbaits" and mainly focus on the features extracted from the <b>headlines,</b> which limits the performance since the consistency between <b>headlines</b> and news bodies is underappreciated. In this paper, we clearly redefine the problem and identify ambiguous and misleading <b>headlines</b> separately. We utilize class sequential rules to exploit structure information when detecting ambiguous <b>headlines.</b> For the identification of misleading <b>headlines,</b> we extract features based on the congruence between <b>headlines</b> and bodies. To make use of the large unlabeled data set, we apply a co-training method and gain an increase in performance. The experiment results show the effectiveness of our methods. Then we use our classifiers to detect inaccurate <b>headlines</b> crawled from different sources and conduct a data analysis. Comment: Accepted by IJCAI 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} how news <b>headlines</b> about politics represent {{the stories they}} lead.

All election <b>headlines</b> and stories published by seven major Canadian dailies and five Internet news websites {{are included in the}} analysis. Results fit with previous work on this topic, demonstrating that mass media <b>headlines</b> convey predictably different cues about politics than the stories they introduce (Andrew 2007). This study, however, also finds consistent differences between the content of online election <b>headlines</b> and those printed by large-circulation newspapers. In short, this paper offers further evidence that people who rely on media-generated shortcuts such as <b>headlines</b> are exposed to a fundamentally different stream of information about politics than those who pay closer attention...|$|R
