40|$|For {{the second}} lab assignment, you will write an RTL {{model of a}} {{two-stage}} pipelined RISC-V-v 2 (a subset of the RISC-V instruction set) processor using Chisel and synthesize your RTL model. After producing a working RTL model, you will attempt to optimize your design to increase performance and/or decrease area. The instruction set allows for both a 32 bit or 64 bit datapath, but as a 64 bit version will take more time to run through the tools, we will be building a 32 bit version. Deliverables This lab is <b>due</b> <b>Monday,</b> September 26 th at 1 pm. Deliverables for this lab are: • (a) your optimized and verified Chisel source {{and all of the}} scripts necessary to completely synthesize your RTL implementation checked into Git • (b) one assembly test program and one C benchmark program to test your implementation • (c) written answers to the questions given {{at the end of this}} document checked into git as writeup/report. pdf or writeup/report. txt You are encouraged to discuss your design with others in the class, but you must turn in your own work. The two-stage pipeline should perform instruction fetch in the first stage, while the second pipeline stage should do everything else including data memory access. If you need to refresh your memory about pipelining and the MIPS instruction set, we recom...|$|E
