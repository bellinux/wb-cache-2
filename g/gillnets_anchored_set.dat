Equating {{is one of the}} crucial steps to generate score conversion table which is used for producing scale score and proficiency level for each individual student. Whether or not the equating is conducted properly considering its practical consequences? Whether or not the <b>anchor</b> <b>set</b> is appropriately applied for the use of equating? Are there any outlier anchor items to be removed from the <b>anchor</b> <b>set?</b> This presentation highlights some considerations to evaluate equating results, including IRT model fit, Test Characteristic Curves (TCCs), score distributions, the score and proficiency profile from the reference year, and property of the <b>anchor</b> <b>set.</b> Also, the consideration and alternative to remove outlier anchor items is discussed.

50|$|Using two <b>anchors</b> <b>set</b> {{approximately}} 45° apart, or wider angles up to 90°, {{from the}} bow {{is a strong}} mooring for facing into strong winds. To <b>set</b> <b>anchors</b> in this way, first one <b>anchor</b> is <b>set</b> in the normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back, a second <b>anchor</b> is <b>set</b> approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second <b>anchor</b> is <b>set,</b> the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.This moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.|$|R

40|$|Most statewide testing {{programs}} use methods {{based on}} item response theory (IRT) to equate tests. Each test generally includes an <b>anchor</b> <b>set</b> {{of items that}} is anchored to the reference scale. IRT calibration of an equating sample brings new items onto the reference scale. Stable, reliable equating {{can have an impact}} at both the individual and institutional levels. In high-stakes testing, individuals may be granted or denied a diploma or other property rights {{on the basis of the}} outcomes of a test that is equated to the reference scale on which the passing standard is set. Similarly, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) law attaches school and district sanctions to objectives measured against standards on a reference scale to which tests are equated. Unstable equating can lead to volatility that may lead unfairly to sanctions or rewards. The quest for stable linkages across years has led to the adoption of post-hoc mechanisms to exclude items from the <b>anchor</b> <b>set.</b> In theory, items should maintain a constant difficulty relative to one another across samples. When this expectation fails, items are said to drift. Using anchor items that drift for construct-irrelevant reasons to anchor a scale can bias test scores. Therefore, operational testing programs seek to exclude such items from the <b>anchor</b> <b>set.</b> Volatility of state trend data is a problem, and more reliable linkages will go a long way to fi...|$|R

To address this issue, we propose a robust localization scheme in wireless sensor networks against wormhole attack, called ConSetLoc, which neither complicated distance measuring devices nor extra complex encrypting algorithms is necessary. With the relationship between hop counts and geographic distance of sensor nodes in the deployment territory, we design a partition method of consistent <b>anchors</b> <b>sets</b> by the convex constraints in geometry which can reduce the effect of bad measurements on estimates,  and then present a filtering strategy for the candidate locations with these <b>anchors</b> <b>sets.</b> In addition, we conduct simulation experiments for performance evaluation and the results demonstrate the proposed ConSetLoc can estimate the locations for most of sensor nodes with good accuracy and stability when wormhole attack exists in the network...|$|R

30|$|As expected, {{the number}} of parts is {{increasing}} with lower bisection tolerances. Also, one can observe (despite the differing colors) that the partitions are hierarchical {{in the sense that}} a coarser <b>anchor</b> point <b>set</b> is a subset of the refined <b>anchor</b> <b>set.</b> Hence, each part of the refined partition always is completely contained in one part of a coarser partition of state space. The partitioning is based on the true projection error, which is reflected in the fact that all clusters are geometrically double-cones centered in the origin. This illustrates the scale invariance of the parts. In particular, points at the opposite side of an anchor point are assigned to the cluster of that anchor point, although these points are maximally distant to this anchor point with respect to the Euclidean distance. Hence, the projection error has a completely different characteristic as the Euclidean distance. As samples with current worst projection error are chosen as new anchor point, it is understandable that these tend to lie at the boundary of the point set and not in the interior.|$|R
