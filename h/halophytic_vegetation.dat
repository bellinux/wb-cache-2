Investigation effects of halophytes on soil characteristics and adaptive mechanisms of the various halophyte types is essential for controlling saline environments. Juncus gerardi is a perennial grass-like halophyte and Halocnemum strobilaceum is a succulent halophyte shrub. The distribution of these species is mound like in the field. The soil samples of the mounds for investigating the effect of these species on plant root environment were compared with near regions in Korsiah saline area in Darab. Also the consentration some ions of live and dead organs and tissues of these species were studied for recognition of their adapive types. The results show that Juncus gerardi decrease salinity in 0 - 30 cm of topsoil, therefore the Ec decreased 37 %. But salinity increased significantly in 30 - 60 cm depth. The identification of ions in plant tissues showed that the concentration of ions is low in dry matter. This is 0. 33 % of dry matter for Sodium. This is a way to rescue from dry conditions by selective absorption of ions. The comparison of root environment of Halocnemum strobilaceum with near regions showed a significant decrease in salinity in 0 - 30 cm and 30 - 60 cm depth decreased 27 % and 40 % respectively. The identification of ions concentrations in plant tissues reflect the high amounts of ions, therefore the plant tissues composed of 8. 18 % of Sodium.

40|$|International audienceA set of 42 modern pollen samples {{has been}} {{investigated}} to determine the relationship between pollen percentages and vegetation composition along a 3600 m elevational mountain-desert transect in central Iran. The studied transect shows three main vegetation groups including a ``high altitude zone'' (embracing subnival, alpine and montane subzones), a ``xerophytic desert steppe zone'', and a ``halophytic zone'', correlated with the groups defined in Correspondence Analysis (CA) of vegetation dataset and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of pollen dataset. The subnival subzone is characterized by high values of Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Cyperaceae pollen, while alpine and montane subzones are characterized by the highest pollen diversity with a predominance of grass pollen along the whole transect. The halophytic zone is dominated by Chenopodiaceae pollen while xerophytic desert steppe shows a high occurrence of Artemisia pollen. The comparison of pollen percentages with the corresponding vegetation plots shows a high congruency between pollen and vegetation compositions of alpine subzone and undisturbed xerophytic desert steppe but a weak correlation between those of the subnival and montane subzones and human affected xerophytic desert steppe. In addition, pollen representation of frequently encountered or important plant taxa in the Irano-Turanian region is provided. The widely used Chenopodiaceae/Artemisia = C/A pollen ratio, as an aridity index, is shown to be unreliable in the Irano-Turanian steppes. Our results suggest that a combined graph of all four indices (C/A pollen ratio, Poaceae/Artemisia = P/A, Poaceae/Chenopodiaceae = P/C and (A + C) /P ratios) can represent the vegetation and climate relationships more accurately. In conclusion, surface pollen composition can reflect the actual vegetation zones/subzones in Irano-Turanian steppes. Together, P/A and P/C ratios are more confident to differentiate mesic from arid steppes, while C/A and (A + C) /P ratios provide a useful tool to differentiate <b>halophytic</b> desert <b>vegetation</b> developed in endorheic depressions with saline soils from xerophytic desert steppe developed in well-drained soils.

These data indicate development of soils and grasslands with associated <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{in the higher}} elevations of the floodplains between ca. 7200 and 6000 (super 14) C yr BP (ca. 8000 and 7000 cal yr BP). At lower elevations halophytic saltmarsh vegetation was replaced by wetland communities (sedges) {{in response to a}} sea-level highstand at 6500 (super 14) C yr BP (ca. 7400 cal yr BP). Soils were buried by expanding wetlands at ca. 6000 (super 14) C yr BP, a trend that persisted until ca. 3400 (super 14) C yr BP (ca. 3700 cal yr BP). Over this interval we observe repeated fluctuations between grassland and <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> in response to variations in water level and physical-chemical conditions resulting from desiccation or flooding events. These variations are caused by hydrologic variability in a subhumid-dry climatic mean state. Channel incision occurred between ca. 3400 and 2500 (super 14) C yr BP (ca. 3700 - 3200 cal yr BP), concurrent with sporadic and intermittent sediment deposition at higher elevations of the floodplain. The pollen record from the paleochannel infilling indicate grasses accompanied by halophytic taxa between ca. 2500 and 800 (super 14) C yr BP (3200 and 700 cal yr BP) deposited in a shallow brackish-to-fresh water body.

40|$|Reconstruction of {{relative}} sea-level (RSL) changes around Greenland’s coasts increases {{our understanding of}} Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) retreat since the last glacial maximum, as well as assisting in constraining models of ice sheet behaviour. Understanding earlier ice sheet responses to climate variation will improve predictions of GIS change under various IPCC climate change scenarios, and therefore of Greenland’s likely contribution to global sea level rise from its loss of ice throughout this century. Salt marshes at Upernavik, northern West Greenland were investigated for their elevation range {{with respect to the}} tide, diatom assemblages, stratigraphy and sediment organic content (loss on ignition), and samples were dated using 210 Pb and AMS 14 C. This is further north than this approach has previously been used. Shallow sediment and slow sedimentation rates, related to adverse growing conditions for the <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation,</b> limited the precision of results, but RSL rise of 0. 3 m occurred over the 100 years prior to 2014, with limiting dates showing at least 0. 2 m rise in the previous 235 years, in agreement with the Huy 3 model of GIS evolution. The contrast with recent RSL stability in south- and central West Greenland probably relates to the later deglaciation of the northern GIS and continuing collapse of the North American Ice Complex forebulge. GPS data from Upernavik show 7. 81 mm/yr crustal uplift from 2007 - 2011, probably linked to retreat of Upernaviks Isstrøm 60 km east of our field site, but the slow accretion of these marshes is unlikely to be able to demonstrate a change from RSL rise to RSL fall for some time.

40|$|Salinity mapping with aerial {{photography}} and multispectral satellite imagery has significant limitations. This study evaluated hyperspectral satellite imagery to map dryland salinity symptoms near the River Murray mouth in South Australia. Hyperion imagery has advantages of high spectral resolution combined with broader spatial coverage {{than a single}} airborne hyperspectral swath. This study aimed to exploit this high spectral resolution in order to discriminate key indicators of salinity: saline soils and perennial <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation,</b> such as samphire (Halosarcia pergranulata). Automatically-generated endmembers derived from the Hyperion image contained significant noise, particularly in the far-NIR region and lacked diagnostic absorption features in the SWIR, making them unsuitable {{as a basis for}} image feature extraction. Instead, partial unmixing used image reference spectra from regions-of-interest that corresponded to known samphire patches and exposed saltpans. KHAT values of 0. 50 and 0. 38 were calculated for the comparison of image and field samphire and saltpan maps respectively. The higher accuracy of the samphire delineation may be due to lower image noise in the visible and NIR, regions containing spectral characteristics associated with vegetation succulence. Higher accuracies may be achieved with improved SNR in the SWIR region because this region contains important spectral properties related to other halophytic adaptations. The mapping accuracy for the saltpans may also be adversely affected by data noise that masked mineral absorption features in the SWIR. If future high spectral resolution satellites have improved SNR, then salinity mapping with satellite imagery has enormous potential. Image analysis of low-noise hyperspectral imagery may be able to discriminate some <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> and isolate spectral features relating to saline mineralogy. Because satellite platforms have the advantage of broader spatial coverage and regular repetition, satellite-based hyperspectral imagery is well suited to monitoring salinity over medium sized catchments.

40|$|We {{describe}} and apply a point {{model of the}} joint evolution of tidal landforms and biota which incorporates the dynamics of intertidal vegetation; benthic microbial assemblages; erosional, depositional, and sediment exchange processes; wind‐wave dynamics, and relative sea level change. Alternative stable states and punctuated equilibria emerge, characterized by possible sudden transitions of the system state, governed by vegetation type, disturbances of the benthic biofilm, sediment availability, and marine transgressions or regressions. Multiple stable states are suggested to result from the interplay of erosion, deposition, and biostabilization, providing a simple explanation for the ubiquitous presence of the typical landforms observed in tidal environments worldwide. The main properties of accessible equilibrium states prove robust with respect to specific modeling assumptions and are thus identified as characteristic dynamical features of tidal systems. <b>Halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> emerges as a key stabilizing factor through wave dissipation, rather than a major trapping agent, because the total inorganic deposition flux {{is found to be}} largely independent of standing biomass under common supply‐limited conditions. The organic sediment production associated with <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> represents a major contributor to the overall deposition flux, thus critically affecting the ability of salt marshes to keep up with high rates of relative sea level rise. The type and number of available equilibria and the possible shifts among them are jointly driven and controlled by the available suspended sediment, the rate of relative sea level change, and vegetation and microphytobenthos colonization. The explicit description of biotic and abiotic processes thus emerges as a key requirement for realistic and predictive models of the evolution of a tidal system as a whole. The analysis of such coupled processes finally indicates that hysteretic switches between stable states arise because of differences in the threshold values of relative sea level rise inducing transitions from vegetated to unvegetated equilibria and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|We {{summarize}} {{the results of}} a multi-proxy study from a 14 C-dated alluvial outcrop sequence at arroyo Claromecó (38 ° 50 'S; 60 ° 0 'W). The results are based on gastropod and palynomorph analyses, alluvial history and both δ 18 O and δ 13 C isotopic values. Gastropods density and abundance were calculated and shell fragmentation was evaluated for taphonomic analysis. Between 7200 and 6540 years before present (BP), sedges associated with <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> and the coexistence of Succinea meridionalis d'Orbigny and Heleobia parchappii d'Orbigny suggest the development of extensive, shallow, freshwater-brackish wetlands. These environmental conditions are in agreement with slight δ 13 C and δ 18 O values suggesting humid conditions. Between 6540 and 6000 years BP the presence of Heleobia australis d'Orbigny, high variability of δ 13 C and a δ 18 O positive trend are related to the influence of marinebrackish water associated with the Holocene sea-level highstand. During this period, <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> was developed. At 6000 years BP a greater expansion of wetlands occurred that persisted until 3440 years BP. H. australis disappeared and the dominance of H. parchappii with good preservation suggest low energy conditions. The highest fluctuations in the isotopic values and palynological spectra suggest an unstable environment related to desiccation/ evaporation events, sea-level fall and fresh water input related to precipitation. Between 3440 and 2500 years BP a channel incision occurred possibly triggered by sea-level fall. After 2500 years BP, the palynological spectra from sediments sporadically deposited in relation to fluvial overflow are in agreement with the high proportion of poorly preserved H. parchappii and Mytilidae remains that indicate a reworked assemblage. Slighter and variable δ 13 C and δ 18 O trends and the halophytic and psammophytic vegetation reflect the wetland desiccation under dry conditions. After 1000 years BP, psammophytic communities developed reflecting sand dunes. Multi-proxy evidences provided an integrated reconstruction of Holocene vegetation and paleoenvironmental conditions related to fluvial activity, sea-level changes and climatic variability.

40|$|Iran {{with its}} diverse c 1 irnatic {{conditions}} and geologic {{and land use}} history support large areas of saline habitats and diverse halophytic flora. The halophytic diversity in not only enriched by the evolving {{of a large number}} of autochthonous Irano-Turanian elements, but also many of the halophytes of other phytochoria like Saharo-Arabian, Mediterranean and even Euro-Siberian elements are represented in Iran. Therefore most of the higher syntaxa of Euro-Mediterranean and Afro-Asian-al last partly-occur in Iran. Prior to a consolidated syntaxonomical system for the <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> of Iran, major <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> units of Iran are summarized and shown along salinity and moisture gradients. These include: (I) : Mangrove communities (Avicennio-Sonneratietea). (2) : Submerged aquatic plant communities (Ruppietea maritimae). (3) : Annual obligatory hygro-halophytic communities on sea, lake and river marshes dominated by stem or leaf succulent C 3 chenopods (Thero-Salicornietea). (4) Semi-woody or perennial halophytic communities on muddy or coastal salt flats dominated by stem succulent C 3 chenopods (Salicornietea fruticosae). (5) : Hydrophi!ous euryhalophytic rush communities: Phragmitetea australis. (6) : Halophytic grassland and herbaceous perennial sedge communities belonging to genera Puccinellia and Juncus (Juncetea maritimi). (7) : Salt marsh and riverine bruchwood communities dominated by salt-excreting halophytes (Tamaricetea ramosissimae, prov.). (8) : Annua 1 halophytic communities dominated by C 4 chenopods in temporary moist and inundated, or disturbed salty soils (Climacopteretea crassae, prov.). (9) : Halophytic shrubby. semi-woody or hemicrytophytic communities on salty and dry soils dominated by lcaf or stem succulent C 4 chenopods (Haloxylo-Salsoletea tomentosae, prov.). (1 O) : Halophytic shrub communities, on salty and sandy coastal or margin of sabkhas with high water table dominated by Nitraria schoberi and Reaumuria fruticosa. (11). Psarno-halophytic shrub communities along sandy coasts of Persian Gulf and Oman sea Sphaerocomion Bucheri and communities of Zygophyllum qatarense and Heliotropium bacciferum and (12) : Unclassified halophytic communities: Herbaceous perennial and hemicryptophyte ha 10 phytic communities of secondary origin...|$|E
40|$|Central Anatolia {{belongs to}} the Irano-Turanian region in terms of phytogeography. Salt marshes occupy a {{significant}} place in this province. <b>Halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> which develops around the salt lakes is floristically very rich and includes many endemic taxa. In this study, five different phytosociological researches, carried out on the salt marsh communities of Central Anatolia were taken as a whole. In all these researches, the vegetation analyses were carried out according to the traditional Braun-Blanquet approach. The nomenclature and classification of syntaxa follow the "International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature". Plant associations misevaluated and/or not considered as validly published were renamed and reclassified. The salt marsh communities which are dealt with in this study belong to the Halostachyetalia and Juncetalia maritimi orders of the Salicornietea classis. These orders are represented by the alliances of Lepidio caespitosi-Limonion iconici and Inulo aucheranae-Elymion salsi in the salt marshes of Central Anatolia...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of the {{observational}} morphological {{structure of a}} lagoonal landscape are performed aimed at examining key assumptions on the geomorphological evolution of wetlands, lagoons, estuarine areas and tidal environments in general. The present note briefly refers about analysis (Feola et al. 2005) regarding statistical measures, morphodynamic implications of topological or metric properties of the observed landforms. In order to accurately characterize morphodynamic features of a lagoonal environment with particular attention to their scale-dependent (or invariant) characters, field surveys and remote sensing are employed. The structure of landscape-forming shear stresses is calculated in unchanneled portions of the landscape suggesting the viability of threshold models of incision {{for the formation of}} tidal channel networks. Distinctive geomorphic indicators, suitable for comparative purposes with modelling of the long term evolution of tidal systems, are also pointed out. Space-distributed analyses of eco-geomorphological properties which strongly suggest the dominance of sub-vertical processes in the control of the distribution of <b>halophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> are finally discussed...|$|E
