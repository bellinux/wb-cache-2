5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

[...] She is actually recording the song <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property. Used in the film as a last-minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis [...] "to find her own voice as a newly independent woman", co-writer Anne Preven called [...] "Listen" [...] a song which [...] "Deena is exclaiming, 'You don't know who I am, and I know I do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The park {{district}} {{allowed the}} museum {{to use one of}} the surviving giraffes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> at a fall festival held at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 1968. The museum subsequently acquired most of the remaining animals in 1969, after a search through the storage building containing the animals. [...] The animals and parts of animals had to be searched for in corners and under boxes in the park district storage building. Besides a large number of horses, 2more giraffes, a lion, and a tiger were found. Photographs of the animals were sent to Frederic Fried, an expert in carousels, who confirmed that the animals were made in the United States, not Germany, probably before 1900. He also confirmed that they were carved by the Dentzel company.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{learning}} about the live telecast, the cast had mixed emotions. Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was nervous about the episode and hoped there would be cue cards. Debra Messing (Grace) [...] "gasped loudly" [...] when {{it was revealed that}} the technical demands of live television would mean that Burrows would not be directing on the stage floor, but would be up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> instead. Messing noted that she had never done live television, but in regards to the live broadcast, said, [...] "It starts out our final season in a real special way." [...] Eric McCormack (Will) was intrigued about the idea and seemed to be ready for whatever happened; [...] "It keeps it interesting for us. It stirs it up. It gives us a new way to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Two cars {{traverse}} the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and {{acts as a}} counterweight. The cars are [...] wide, [...] tall, and [...] long, and are large enough to carry either 65people, 6motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars {{are open to the}} elements, an enclosed seating area containing a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline.

The cable on the north track is [...] long, while the south cable is [...] shorter. Each car weighs , but they, and consequently the cables, can carry an additional load of [...] A [...] electric motor turns the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to power the incline. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is unusual in that the motor and winch are located at a 90-degree angle to the incline instead of directly underneath it. Operation of the incline is controlled via a foot pedal located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> in the upper station.|$|E
500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth.</b> I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Odd Blood {{is built}} around sonic {{experimentation}} with different genres and synthetic musical elements. Yeasayer tried to commit to certain styles for an entire song and [...] "not jump around". Opener [...] "The Children" [...] is an electronically manipulated song created with the extensive use of subwoofers. The band members sang its harmonies through a fan and used pitch shifters and were determined to have the song as the first track, especially because Keating {{liked the idea of}} starting the album as [...] "a departure point" [...] from the last [...] "very choral" [...] song on All Hour Cymbals. Pitch shifting is also used on [...] "Ambling Alp", first created as an instrumental demo by Tuton. Using a Harmonic Octave Generator effects pedal, he made his arpeggiated bass guitar notes sound like a flute's acoustic output. Keating then sampled the solo and built a song around it; his a cappella singing was recorded both conventionally <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> and in the studio's basement with a distant miking scheme inspired by David Bowie's 1977 album [...] "Heroes".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the cook-off, running {{commentary}} is made <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> {{near the}} cooking area by an announcer, Kenji Fukui; a commentator, Yukio Hattori, {{and one or}} two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally Shinichiro Ohta) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four and, later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality. [...] Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with ten given for taste and five each for presentation and originality. [...] The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef that makes the highest points total.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{publication}} {{took place}} in Spencer, Indiana, and upon its release was shipped to retail chains such as Fry's Electronics, Egghead Software and CompUSA. The design of the game cover closely mimicked that of the Windows 95 packaging. During development, Parroty Interactive had planned to promote the game at the COMDEX computer expo by Fall in 1997. The presentation was to include a Bill Gates lookalike. However the staff were expelled by security from the convention and the distribution plan was shut down. Despite this setback, the company presented their product at the Macworld expo in Silicon Valley, San Francisco next January, receiving praise from Macintosh users. At the event they demoed the CEO-themed Tamagotchi spoof [...] "Billagotchi", and [...] "Windows Exploder" [...] game where players blows away error messages. CD copies of the game were sold <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> for $20 each. Microsoft also debuted some new products at Macworld such as Office 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0. While noting that he was yet to examine the Palladium Interactive title, Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray commented that [...] "ours are probably a little more serious" [...] than Microshaft Winblows 98, and that the corporation [...] "tr {{to have a sense}} of humor about this sort of thing".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} signaling {{technology and}} subsequent enhancements {{used to control}} the trains was developed by Westinghouse. When revenue service began, [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies), trains that {{show up on the}} computer system as being in a specific place but don't physically exist, were common, and real trains could at times disappear from the system. This was the result of dew on the tracks and too low of a voltage (at 0.6 volts rather than the industry standard 15 volts) being passed through the rails for train detection. Under such circumstances, trains had to be operated manually and were restricted to a speed of [...] Enhancements were made to the train control system to address these [...] "ghost trains" [...] (or false occupancies). However, manual blocking— operators <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>booth</b> on the platform at alternate stations, with a telephone and red/green lights — that kept trains in stations until the train ahead had left its station were mandated for several years. This caused a great outcry in the press and led to a flurry of litigation between Westinghouse, the original controls contractor, and BART, as well as public battles between the state government (advised by University of California professor Dr. Bill Wattenburg), the federal government, and the district, but in time these problems were resolved and BART became a reliable service. Ghost trains persisted on the system as late as 2007, and while usually cleared quickly enough to avoid significant delay, they can occasionally cause an extended backup of manually operated trains in the system. In addition, the fare card system was easily hackable with equipment commonly found in universities, although most of these flaws have been fixed.|$|E
