30|$|The data of {{the present}} study show that the MTDs {{recorded}} at site C 0018 in the slope basin of the Nankai accretionary prism occur within interglacials, suggesting that the MTDs were emplaced during phases of relative high sea level and temperatures. This implicates the role of climate as a primary preconditioning factor for slope failures in this highly active tectonic region. If we assume the result to be representative, it is necessary to discuss this possible relationship. As numerous articles have discussed the relationship between climate and submarine landslides (e.g., Owen et al. 2007; Maslin et al. 2010), here, we consider the climate-influenced factors (e.g., sea level, water temperature, and related factors such as gas hydrate destabilization and sedimentation rates) that could precondition slope failures and only briefly discuss how these factors may be applicable in the studied setting. The discussion will mainly focus on the example of MTD 1 {{in the context of the}} last <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Information {{obtained}} {{from previous studies}} {{has been used to}} study carbon flux during the last <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> in the siliciclastics-dominated inner continental shelf of the South China Sea off Hong Kong. The information included grab sampling surveys, many kilometres of high-resolution reflection seismic profiles and numerous boreholes. During the high sea-level stand of the Holocene and the last interglacial period, the inner shelf of Hong Kong was a net carbon sink. This is particularly so in the present day mainly through the discharge of anthropogenic sewage. The offshore dredging of mud and the offshore mining of sand and gravel deposits have nevertheless led to the release of methane and other gases either trapped beneath Holocene deposits or originating from the bacterial breakdown of plant matter within Pleistocene deposits contributing greenhouse gases. During the last glacial period, significant quantities of carbon dioxide formed by the dissolution of carbonates through acid-sulphate development on the subaerially marine deposits of last interglacial age, and biogenic methane formed by the bacterial breakdown of fossilized plant matter in the underlying deposits was released into the atmosphere from the exposed shelf. Due mainly to the poor drainage conditions, the exposed shelf was unlikely to support a dense vegetation cover causing a lowering of carbon storage through terrestrial plants. The role of greenhouse gases generated, trapped and escaping from the present-day continental shelves during the last <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> requires consideration in the estimation of global carbon flux. Reflection seismic profiling is useful as a method for mapping the present-day shelves to permit the identification of areas affected by acoustic turbidity. For the interval between the Holocene and the last interglacial, the geochemical characterization of sediment extracts is needed for the estimation of carbon flux and for obtaining information on past vegetation history. This necessitates the study of outer shelf sediments from water depths between about 130 and 200 m below the present-day sea level. The release of greenhouse gases from the exposed shelves during the last glacial period is suggested to provide a triggering mechanism for switching the earth into the present interglacial mode. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

The average fluxes of mineral aerosol to Dome Fuji in the periods of glacial maximum, 18. 6 ± 10. 1 mg·m – 2 ·yr – 1, were larger than the value in the interglacial periods, 3. 77 ± 2. 20 mg·m – 2 ·yr – 1.

The results obtained in this study suggest that the variation of mineral aerosol flux in Dome Fuji, together with climate change, was much larger than that of sea-salt aerosol flux.

This result strengthens the outcomes of former studies that coral growth in the temperate NE Atlantic encompassing the French, Iberian and Moroccan margins dominated during glacial periods, whereas in the higher latitudes (Irish and Norwegian margins) extended coral growth prevailed during interglacial periods. Thus {{it appears that the}} biogeographical limits for sustained cold-water coral growth along the NE Atlantic margin are strongly related to climate change. By focussing on the last glacial <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle,</b> this study shows that palaeo-productivity was increased during the last glacial. This was likely driven by the fertilisation effect of an increased input of aeolian dust and locally intensified upwelling. After the Younger Dryas cold event, the input of aeolian dust and productivity significantly decreased concurrent with an increase in water temperatures in the GoC. This primarily resulted in reduced food availability and caused a widespread demise of the formerly thriving coral ecosystems.

Spectral analysis of the records allowed us to examine the ecological imprints of orbital changes on planktic foraminiferal and coccolithophore assemblages and on the pattern of primary production in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, north of the Equatorial upwelling. Independent productivity reconstructions based on phyto- and zooplankton assemblages show a coherent pattern dominated by orbital precession, which appears to have control productivity changes recorded in the studied core over the last glacial <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle.</b> The proposed mechanism of this control invokes an atmospheric forcing associated with equatorial insolation maxima in spring and fall with a period of similar to 20 ka. Faunal evidence for a stronger upper-ocean mixing with enhanced nutrient supply to the euphotic zone suggests a more vigorous local atmospheric circulation and associated enlargement of the Costa Rica Dome that influenced the core site at times of May insolation maxima. The last two terminations in the studied record are associated with conspicuous changes in planktic assemblages which require additional nutrient-delivery mechanisms to amplify the precession forcing. Our faunal and stable isotope data are in favour of the previously postulated nutrient advection via the Southern Ocean ``tunnelling'' operating during deglaciations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It {{has been suggested}} that the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) was considerably smaller during past interglaciations. Although no complete record of an <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> exists from Greenland, marine records from the Labrador Sea also imply a largely reduced southern GIS for MIS 5 e and 11. This finding seems consistent with surface ocean reconstructions from the North Atlantic where SSTs were higher in these older interglaciations than during the Holocene. These data also suggest a more vigorous subpolar gyre system with consequences for the atmospheric circulation and the ocean heat transfer into the Northwest Atlantic. By comparison, past interglaciations in the Nordic seas show cold surface conditions, especially for MIS 9 and MIS 11, implying a rather ’active’ eastern GIS. This contrast in the meridional ocean heat flux between the polar and subpolar North Atlantic during past interglaciations should have affected not only the actual interglacial size and melting history of the GIS. It is further concluded that the dynamical interactions between surface ocean temperature/salinity, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation patterns played the dominant role for the interglacial climate regionality in the high-latitude North Atlantic sector and, beyond that, also impacted the cross-arctic interglacial development...|$|E

The Keele Formation, a 300 – 600 m thick carbonate and siliciclastic deposit, comprises {{the upper part of}} this <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle.</b> Sedimentary facies in the lower, carbonate-dominated member of the Keele span a broad spectrum of depositional environments, from below storm-wave-base to peritidal to continental, and are disposed across a relatively narrow paleogeographic belt. Lateral arrangement of facies and the gradual stratigraphic transitions between them, suggest deposition in a ramp setting; local slump structures and occasional debrites in deep-water facies imply that the ramp was distally steepened. Fluvial facies are concentrated at a single locality, indicating that terrigenous-clastic sediment was derived from a point source or sources. Most strata of the carbonates are “Bahamian ” in character and similar to Phanerozoic warm-water carbonates in that they contain abundant calcite ooids of interpreted original aragonitic mineralogy and have well-developed muddy peritidal facies. Nevertheless, close juxtaposition of deep- and shallow-water facies in Keele rocks indicates high-amplitude sea-level change during deposition, on the order of ∼ 100 m, suggesting accumulation in a climatic icehouse period. This interpretation implies that although the globe possessed polar and high-altitude glaciers at this time, sea-surface temperature, at least at tropical latitudes, warmed dramatically between Neoproterozoic glacial episodes.

This is especially {{the case for}} the successive regressions and transgressions over the last <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle,</b> which have shaped the deposition, preservation and erosion patterns of unconsolidated sediments currently submerged on continental shelves. The current study focuses on creating an integrated marine and terrestrial geophysical and litho-stratigraphic framework of the coastal zone of Hadera, north-central Israel. This research presents a case study, investigating the changing sedimentological units in the study area. Analysis suggest these represent various coastal environments and were deposited during times of lower than present sea level and during the later stages of the Holocene transgression. A multi-disciplinary approach was applied by compiling existing elevation raster grids, bathymetric charts, one hundred lithological borehole data-sets, and a 110 km-long sub-bottom geophysical survey. Based on seismic stratigraphic analysis, observed geometries, and reflective appearances, six bounding surfaces and seven seismic units were identified and characterized. These seismic units have been correlated with the available borehole data to produce a chronologically constrained lithostratigraphy for the area. This approach allowed us to propose a relationship between the lithological units and sea-level change and thus enable the reconstruction of Hadera coastal evolution over the last ~ 100 ka. This reconstruction suggests that the stratigraphy is dominated by lowstand aeolian and fluvial terrestrial environments, subsequently transgressed during the Holocene. The results of this study provide a valuable framework for future national strategic shallow-water infrastructure construction and also for the possible locations of past human settlements in relation to coastal evolution through time...|$|E

Fifteen cores were sampled {{with the aim of}} developing an integrated biostratigraphy and palaeoecology based on calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, planktonic and benthic foraminifera, framed in a depositional process reconstruction. Barren gray laminated and brown bioturbated hemipelagic sediments characterize glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycles,</b> respectively. Analyses from both intervals allow comparison between microfossil occurrence in glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycles.</b> The unit boundaries were drawn more accurately by means of the microfossil distribution. On the basis of micropalaeontological and sedimentological evidence, Interglacial Unit C is correlated to Oxygen Isotope Stage 5, thus dating the unit boundaries at 127 and 70 ka. Peaks in diatom abundance correlate well with interglacial units and indicate high productivity and an open ocean environment. A calcareous nannofossil cold-taxa association is present in most cores examined, and its consistent distribution within Interglacial Unit C indicates key environmental relationships. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossils has been related to temperature tolerance, sea-ice cover reduction, nutrient availability, and factors limiting primary productivity. Our results confirm that coccolithophorids occurred at southern high latitudes, in the western marginal basins of the Antarctic Peninsula, during short periods of the Late Quaternary.

Using a model with a novel representation of the effect of temperature on phytoplankton stoichiometry, we have investigated the influence of mixed-layer depth and water temperature on the elemental composition of an algal community.

New data are presented from Shoeburyness, where a deeply incised channel filled with interglacial sediment can be directly related to the terrace stratigraphy of the River Thames. Fossil assemblages confirm that the interglacial beds began accumulating in a freshwater environment, which became transformed into a dynamic estuary as relative sea-levels rose. Pollen data confirm that this occurred early in the interglacial when mixed oak forest was becoming established. The geological context of the sediments indicates that they post-date the Anglian glaciation, yet pre-date the Barling Gravel terrace aggradation, which has been ascribed to MIS 8. Amino acid racemisation data based on Bithynia opercula further constrain the age to the Hoxnian (=MIS 11) or to MIS 9. An MIS 9 attribution is favoured because (i) AAR data suggest that the sequence post-dates the interglacial channel-fill at Clacton, which is widely ascribed to the Hoxnian; (ii) the bivalve Corbicula occurred early within the interglacial (unlike its late appearance during the Hoxnian); and (iii) the sequence includes evidence for a marine transgression that occurred earlier in the <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> than it did at local Hoxnian sites.

This community is more diverse, but less abundant in total standing stock and shell flux than the subarctic community of the Gulf of Alaska. The use of plankton tow and isotopic data allow us to partition the foraminiferal community into shallow dwelling euphotic zone species and deep dwelling sub-thermocline species. On both the event and seasonal time scales, heterotrophic species were most abundant in cold, biomass rich coastal waters. In contrast, species which harbored endosymbionts were more abundant in oligotrophic waters with higher ambient light levels. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the diverse modern fauna was replaced with a low diversity, high flux, heterotrophic community {{similar to that of the}} modern Gulf of Alaska. Modern analog temperature estimates suggest the California Current was roughly 3 °C cooler during the LGM than today. Coupled with oxygen isotopic results from G. bulloides, the surface thermal structure implies an equatorward flowing glacial California Current at these sites. The Polar Front thus remained north of these locations during the LGM. Comparison of glacial G. bulloides carbon isotopes and shell accumulation rates with organic carbon flux estimates implies the glacial California Current was (1) higher in nutrient content, (2) lower in plankton biomass, and (3) lower in export carbon flux than its modem counterpart.

40|$|The {{shelf edge}} and {{slope of the}} Great Barrier Reef is heavily incised by {{submarine}} canyons which terminate in the Queensland Trough. Traditionally, sedimentation on the margin has been investigated {{within the framework of}} idealized siliciclastic or carbonate systems, depending on whether rivers or shallow marine carbonate producers dominate supply. The widely accepted paradigm ('reciprocal' sedimentation) states that sea-level strongly influences shelf, slope and basin sedimentation, with siliciclastics dominating lowstand periods and carbonates dominating transgressions/highstands. However, recent work (e. g., Dunbar and Dickens, 2003) on cores from the slope and basin has challenged this view. These workers argue that accumulation of both siliciclastic and carbonate sediments varies in phase, with the highest rates observed during transgressions, lowest rates during lowstands and moderate sedimentation during highstands. Irrespective of which model is correct, exactly how the sediment (carbonate or siliciclastic) moves from the shelf to the basin, and the role of submarine canyons in this process is not understood. We address this problem directly by investigating sedimentation in the canyons bordering the GBR. Combining new multibeam bathymetry and seismic data with x-radiograph, magnetic susceptibility, insitu reflectance spectroscopy, grain size, CNS, petrologic, pollen and 14 C AMS analyses of canyon cores off Cooktown and Cairns, we aim to establish the source, timing and frequency of turbidite events deposited in the canyons over the last glacial to <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle,</b> thereby testing the competing models. Our preliminary data confirm that: (1) the canyons record a distinct sedimentary shift from siliciclastic turbidites to calciturbidites; (2) the siliciclastic turbidites were deposited before 28 ka - providing strong support for the "reciprocal" model of margin sedimentation; and (3) the canyons have been active throughout the last deglaciation and into the late Holocene...|$|E

These fill a channel cut into London Clay bedrock and overlain by the Barling Gravel, a Thames-Medway deposit equivalent to the Lynch Hill and Corbets Tey Gravels of the Middle and Lower Thames, respectively. The channel sediments yielded diverse molluscan and ostracod assemblages, both implying fully interglacial conditions and a slight brackish influence. Pollen analysis {{has shown that the}} deposits accumulated during the early part of an interglacial. Plant macrofossils, particularly the abundance of Trapa natans, reinforce the interglacial character of the palaeontological evidence. A beetle fauna, which includes four taxa unknown in Britain at present, has allowed quantification of palaeotemperature using the mutual climatic range method (Tmax 17 to 26 °C; Tmin - 11 to 13 °C). A few vertebrate remains have been recovered from the interglacial deposits, but a much larger fauna, as well as Palaeolithic artefacts, is known from the overlying Barling Gravel. The age of the interglacial deposits is inferential. The geological context suggests a late Middle Pleistocene interglacial, part of the post-diversion Thames system and therefore clearly post-Anglian. This conclusion is supported by amino acid ratios from the shells of freshwater molluscs. The correlation of the overlying Barling Gravel with the Lynch Hill/Corbets Tey aggradation of the Thames valley constrains the age of the Barling interglacial to marine oxygen isotope stages 11 or 9. The presence of Corbicula fluminalis and Pisidium clessini confirms a pre-Ipswichian (marine oxygen isotope substage 5 e) age and their occurrence {{in the early part of}} the <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> at Barling precludes correlation with marine oxygen isotope stage 11, as these taxa occur only later in that interglacial at sites such as Swanscombe and Clacton. Thus by process of elimination a marine oxygen isotope stage 9 age would appear probable. ...|$|E
40|$|Multidisciplinary {{investigations}} of the vegetational, faunal and sea-level history inferred from the infills of buried channels {{on the coast of}} eastern Essex have a direct bearing on the differentiation of MIS 11 and MIS 9 in continental records. New data are presented from Cudmore Grove, an important site on Mersea Island that can be linked to the terrace sequence of the River Thames. The vegetational history has been reconstructed from a pollen sequence covering much of the interglacial represented. The temperate nature of the climate is apparent from a range of fossil groups, including plant remains, vertebrates (especially the rich herpetofauna), molluscs and beetles, which all have strong thermophilous components. The beetle data have been used to derive a Mutual Climatic Range reconstruction, suggesting that mean July temperatures were about 2  °C warmer than modern values for southeast England, whereas mean January temperatures may have been slightly colder. The sea-level history has been reconstructed from the molluscs, ostracods and especially the diatoms, which indicate that the marine transgression occurred considerably earlier in the <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> than at the neighbouring Hoxnian site at Clacton. There are a number of palynological similarities between the sequence at Cudmore Grove and Clacton, especially the presence of Abies and the occurrence of Azolla filiculoides megaspores. Moreover, both sites have yielded Palaeolithic archaeology, indeed the latter is the type site of the Clactonian (flake-and-core) industry. However, the sites can be differentiated on the basis of mammalian biostratigraphy, new aminostratigraphic data, as well as the differences in the sea-level history. The combined evidence suggests that the infill of the channel at Cudmore Grove accumulated during MIS 9, whereas the deposits at Clacton formed during MIS 11. The infill of a much later channel, yielding non-marine molluscs and vertebrates including Hippopotamus, appears to have formed during the Ipswichian (MIS 5 e). This evidence is compared with other important sites of late Middle Pleistocene age in Britain and elsewhere on the continent and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach is stressed...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of palynological and geochemical analyses, a {{sediment}} section near the village of Vevais (north-eastern Brandenburg) is assumed to encompass a succession of Saalian, Eemian and Weichselian sediments and is expected to cover a time span from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to MIS 2. It is regarded as a key site {{for the study of the}} last <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycle</b> in north-eastern Germany. Palynological analyses had revealed an almost complete record of the Eemian (MIS 5 e) preserved within a succession of lake marls exposed in the sediment sequence, but results from numerical dating methods were still missing. Within this study five samples from sand layers within the profile have been analyzed using luminescence dating techniques in order to set up a geochronometrical time frame for the Eemian interglacial. First results from Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz showed severe age underestimation of some samples with regard to their relative stratigraphical position to the Eemian lake marls. Radionuclide analyses revealed disequilibria within the 238 U decay chain and inconsistencies concerning the 40 K content for most of the samples. In order to overcome these dosimetric problems, additional Infrared Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) and post-Infrared Yellow OSL (post-IR YOSL) measurements from feldspar were conducted and a ‘subtraction dating’ method was successfully applied. Hence, it was for the first time possible to set up a time frame for the Eemian interglacial inferred from luminescence dating techniques of a terrestrial sedimentary archive in north-eastern Germany. The onset of the Eemian was dated to 126 ± 16 ka. The termination and beginning transition from the Eemian to the Weichselian cold stage was dated to 108. 9 ± 7. 8 ka. These results are in excellent agreement with the marine isotope record as well as with the results of the analysis of the continuous varve record of Lago Grande di Monticchio, with a period of 17. 7 ± 0. 2 ka from the onset at 127. 2 ± 1. 6 ka BP for the Eemian interglacial...|$|E
30|$|The Kokumoto Formation {{represents}} an expanded and well-exposed sedimentary succession across the Lower–Middle Pleistocene boundary, {{particularly in the}} Chiba composite section (Yoro-Tabuchi, Yoro-River, Yanagawa, and Kogusabata sections) (Fig.  1 b). The predominant silty beds of the Chiba composite section are intensely bioturbated, {{and there is a}} lack of evidence for episodic deposition such as slumps or muddy turbidites, although minor sandy beds are intercalated within the silty section, particularly in the lower part of the section (Nishida et al. 2016). Marine oxygen isotope records reveal continuous deposition from MIS 21 to MIS 18 with glacial and <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycles</b> corresponding to sandstone- and siltstone-dominated units, respectively (Okada and Niitsuma 1989; Pickering et al. 1999; Suganuma et al. 2015). The Byk-E tephra is widely distributed in the area and provides an excellent stratigraphic marker for the Lower–Middle Pleistocene boundary in the Chiba composite section (Suganuma et al. 2015). The Byk-E tephra bed consists of white, glassy, fine-grained ash and has 1 – 3  cm in thickness (Kazaoka et al. 2015).|$|R

An Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity (LLN 2 -D NH) [Gallee et al., J. Geophys. Res. 96 (1991) 1316 1] was able to simulate long-term climatic variations such as the recurrence of glacial <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycles</b> during the Quaternary. This model is used here to simulate the future climate. In most of the hypotheses, the model simulates an extended present interglacial covering the next 50 000 years. A regional atmospheric model (MAR) [Gallee, Mon. Weather Rev. 123 (7) (1995) 2051 - 2069; Gallee, Schayes, Bound-Lay. Meteorol. 59 (1994) 141 - 161] allows the simulation of the climatic changes at a more local scale, in particular {{in the case of an}} increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and of a change in the astronomical forcing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the evolution of the Nile deep-sea turbidite system during the last 200 kyr, over a series of glacial to <b>interglacial</b> <b>cycles.</b> Six individual deep-sea fans were identified from an extensive field data set. Each fan comprises a canyon, channel system and terminal lobes. Two of these fan systems were possibly active at the same time, at least during some periods. Large-scale slope failures destroyed channel segments and caused the formation of new submarine fan systems. These slope failures thus {{played an important role in}} the overall evolution of the turbidite system. During the last glacial maximum (ca 25 to 14 Æ 8 ka) the central and eastern parts of the Nile deep-sea turbidite system were relatively inactive. This inactivity corresponds to a lowstand in sea-level, and a period of arid climate and relatively low sediment discharge from the Nile fluvial system. Rapid accumulation of fluvial flood-derived deposits occurred across the shallower part of the submarine delta during sea-level rise between ca 14 Æ 8 and 5 ka. The most recent deep-se...|$|R
