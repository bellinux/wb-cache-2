5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E

As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman {{the money would be}} used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E

It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> voluntary act {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E

5|$|Papa Stour is {{the subject}} of a 1299 {{manuscript}} written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland.

There is a circle of stones near the beach at Housa Voe, which are the remains of a 'ting', or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord Thorvald Thoresson, who was accused of corruption in the 1299 document and was later called ‘dominus de Papay’. (The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above.) The remains of Duke Hakon's thirteenth-century house are still visible near Housa Voe.|$|E

5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning life as The Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 {{to see if}} they would be interested in him pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E
