5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions {{prohibit the}} use of the phrase kosher in a product's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, <b>in</b> <b>others</b> the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and <b>in</b> <b>others</b> still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E

We identified the types of trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people <b>in</b> the two groups of adolescents.

Offenders reveal great variability <b>in</b> trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people. We describe a specific feature of confidence in offenders: their desire to establish shorter psychological distance from particular people, compared to law-abiding subjects. The factors causing the particular trust <b>in</b> <b>other</b> people are compared in juvenile offenders and in law-abiding teenagers.
