The parents began their family at age 16 with a son, also called Daniel, followed by Bernard, Anna and finally Marguerite, {{when they were in}} their 40s. When she was a young child, the family relocated to Somerville, a working class suburb of Boston, where LeHand was struck by rheumatic fever at age fifteen. It permanently damaged her heart, causing episodes of atrial fibrillation and leading to her premature death. Eleanor Roosevelt later stated that the disease had left <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> and barred from strenuous exercise. She graduated from Somerville High School in 1917, where she took secretarial courses in preparation for a career. Although she never attended college, in 1937 Rosary College (now called Dominican University) recognized her professional achievements with an honorary Doctor of Laws, presented at the White House.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, {{steel making}} was a defense industry, so {{they wanted to}} be sure {{national}} security was not endangered.

She abandoned a burgeoning career in silents for marriage to Philip Plant in 1925, but resumed her film career after their divorce, {{with the advent of}} talking pictures (1929), and with <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> blonde features and glamorous fashion style, she quickly became a popular film star.|$|E

Had they waited another day, they {{would no longer have}} {{required}} her father's consent. Their marriage proved a remarkable business partnership, with Clara acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidant to her husband. Despite <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after they married, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|Working with, transporting, and exhibiting butter sculptures {{presented}} Brooks with {{a unique}} set of challenges. To preserve <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> butter sculptures, she created them in flat metallic milk pans which she set in larger pans filled with ice. By continuing to supply the outer pans with ice, she was able to keep her butter sculptures in good condition for months. When attempting to sail from New York to France with a life-size butter sculpture, she was forced to delay her departure until she was able to secure passage on a ship with sufficient ice to preserve her work throughout the journey; and then she faced the task of finding a railroad car which also had enough ice to safely transport the piece from Le Havre to the final destination of Paris.|$|E

He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being [...] "raw and vulnerable" [...] and confessed that it was [...] "fascinating— and difficult— to watch.

[...] Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future. Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer [...] "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense." [...] Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show, saying [...] "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans as she spoke at length between songs." [...] Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be [...] "inspired, and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> charms in a way I can't recall any other act having ever done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Russell shortly fell ill—the first {{reported}} illness of many throughout her career. She returned in 1885, playing Zaire {{in the play}} Broken Hearts written by W.S. Gilbert. Later in the year, she performed in Young Mrs. Winthrop with the Palmer Company in Philadelphia. She later returned to New York with the same company to perform at Madison Square Theatre as Ada in Sealed Intentions. which received a stellar review on opening night.

2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> wisp, but {{it sounds as if}} she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't the way to do that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of her brother in 1870, the people of Acre started to respect the Bahá'ís and in particular, `Abdu'l-Bahá, `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to arrange for houses to be rented for the family, the family later moved to the Mansion of Bahjí around 1879 when an {{epidemic}} caused the inhabitants to flee. Bahíyyih was 23 when she left the harsh prison. Despite the unhappy start, Acre was the place of some of the happiest times of Bahíyyih Khánum's life. With `Abdu'l-Bahá's marriage to Munírih Khánum, she had a companion of the same age and the two became close friends of each other. The Bahá’ís realised that it was unlikely Bahíyyih Khánum would ever marry and she was respected for her choice of singlehood over matrimony at a time when marriage was seen as obligatory for a young woman. Bahíyyih Khánum helped her mother and father with serving pilgrims who came and visited the family. She was always concerned over <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> mother's heath and served her diligently. [...] Bahá’u’lláh saw his daughter as consolation and solace describing [...] "how sweet thy presence before Me; how sweet to gaze upon thy face, to bestow upon thee My loving-kindness, to favour thee with My tender care".|$|E

She remembers discovering he truly was dead and lying in the snow, hoping for her own death. Hilde and Erika visit her old house and she recalls beatings; they then visit the pond where she is reminded of the many loads of laundry she was forced to wash with her mother. She begrudged the freedom of her brothers who were not forced to do work, her oldest sister, Renate, who lived with their grandparents, and <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> sister, Monika, who was never asked to manage hard labor. They walk down the lane to the old school lined with apple trees; she recalls the rough feeling of cobblestones on her sore feet and the bitter taste of the small apples. She evades a certain barn on the lane and avoids looking out into the distance towards the area which was once the site of Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp.|$|E
2500|$|From early childhood, Franklin showed {{exceptional}} scholastic abilities. At age six, {{she joined}} her brother Roland at Norland Place School, a private day school in West London. At that time, her aunt Mamie (Helen Bentwich), described {{her to her}} husband: [...] "Rosalind is alarmingly clever – she spends all her time doing arithmetic for pleasure, and invariably gets her sums right." [...] She also developed an early interest in cricket and hockey. At age nine, she entered a boarding school, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex. The school was near the seaside, and the family wanted a good environment for <b>her</b> <b>delicate</b> health. She was eleven {{when she went to}} St Paul's Girls' School, West London, one of the few girls' schools in London that taught physics and chemistry. At St Paul's she excelled in science, Latin, and sports. She also learned German, and became fluent in French, a language she would later find useful. She topped her classes, and won annual awards. Her only educational weakness was in music, for which the school music director, the composer Gustav Holst, once called upon her mother to inquire whether she might have suffered from hearing problem or tonsillitis. With six distinctions, she passed her matriculation in 1938, winning a scholarship for university, the School Leaving Exhibition of £30 a year for three years, and £5 from her grandfather. Her father asked her to give the scholarship to a deserving refugee student.|$|E

2500|$|German {{influence}} in Koidula's work was unavoidable. The Baltic Germans had retained hegemony {{in the region}} since the 13th century, throughout German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule and thus German was the language of tuition and of the intelligentsia in 19th century Estonia. Like her father (and all other Estonian writers at the time) Koidula translated much sentimental German prose, poetry and drama {{and there is a}} particular influence of the Biedermeier movement. Biedermeier, a style which dominated 'bourgeois' art in continental Europe from 1815 to 1848, developed {{in the wake of the}} suppression of revolutionary ideas following the defeat of Napoleon. It was plain, unpretentious and characterised by pastoral romanticism; its themes were the home, the family, religion and scenes of rural life. The themes of Koidula's early Vainulilled (Meadow Flowers; 1866) were certainly proto-Biedermeier, but <b>her</b> <b>delicate,</b> melodic treatment of them was in no way rustic or unsophisticated, as demonstrated in the unrestrained patriotic outpourings of Emajõe Ööbik. Koidula reacted to the historical subjugation of the Estonian people as to a personal affront; she spoke of slavery and the yoke of subordination as if from personal experience. By the time of the National Awakening in the 1860s, Estonia had been ruled by foreign powers – Danish, German, Swedish, Polish and Russian – for over 600 years. In this context, she was conscious of her own role in the destiny of the nation. [...] She once wrote to a Finnish correspondent: [...] "It is a sin, a great sin, to be little in great times when a person can actually make history".|$|E
