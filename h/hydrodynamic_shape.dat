Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shape.</b> The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

40|$|Proteins often {{exist as}} {{ensembles}} of interconverting states in solution {{which are often}} difficult to quantify. In the present manuscript we show {{that the combination of}} MS under nondenaturing conditions and AUC-SV (analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity) unambiguously clarifies a distribution of states and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shapes</b> of assembled oligomers for the NAP- 1 (nucleosome assembly protein 1). MS established the number of associated units, which was utilized as input for the numerical analysis of AUC-SV profiles. The AUC-SV analysis revealed that less than 1 % of NAP- 1 monomer exists at the micromolar concentration range and that the basic assembly unit consists of dimers of yeast or human NAP- 1. These dimers interact non-covalently to form even-numbered higher-assembly states, such as tetramers, hexamers, octamers and decamers. MS and AUC-SV consistently showed that the formation of the higher oligomers was suppressed with increasing ionic strength, implicating electrostatic interactions in the formation of higher oligomers. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shapes</b> of the NAP- 1 tetramer estimated from AUC-SV agreed with the previously proposed assembly models built using the known three-dimensional structure of yeast NAP- 1. Those of the hexamer and octamer could be represented by new models shown in the present study. Additionally, MS was used to measure the stoichiometry of the interaction between the human NAP- 1 dimer and the histone H 2 A-H 2 B dimer or H 3 -H 4 tetramer. The present study illustrates a rigorous procedure for the analysis of protein assembly and protein-protein interactions in solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Winds from {{accretion}} disks {{have been}} proposed as the driving source for precessing jets and extreme bipolar morphologies in Planetary Nebulae (PNe) and proto-PNe (pPNe). Here we apply MHD disk wind models to PNe and pPNe by estimating separately the asymptotic MHD wind velocities and mass loss rates. We show that the resulting winds can recover the observed momentum and energy input rates for PNe and pPNe. Introduction While considerable {{progress has been made}} in understanding the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shaping</b> of elliptical and bilobed PNe (Balick & Frank 2002), the origin of extreme butterfly nebulae as well as jets in PNe continues to pose a number of problems for theorists.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We devised, implemented, {{and tested}} {{a new concept}} for {{efficient}} local surface chemistry that we call hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinement (hierarchical HFC). This concept leverages the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shaping</b> of multiple layers of liquid to address challenges inherent to microscale surface chemistry, such as minimal dilution, economical consumption of reagent, and fast liquid switching. We illustrate two modes of hierarchical HFC, nested and pinched, by locally denaturing and recovering a 26 bp DNA with as little as 2 % dilution and by efficiently patterning an antibody on a surface, with a 5 μm resolution and a 100 -fold decrease of reagent consumption compared to microcontact printing. In addition, valveless switching between nanoliter volumes of liquids was achieved within 20 ms. We believe hierarchical HFC will have broad utility for chemistry on surfaces at the microscale. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{explained in}} this paper was carried out to investigate the efficiency of different steering systems on sailing yachts. The steering system of a sail yacht mostly includes a simple steering system and a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>shaped</b> single rudder or multiple rudders, depending on boat characteristics. One of the basic design guidelines for fast sailing yachts is to reduce wetted surface to minimum allowed by the dynamic stability and maintaining the sailing performances. Deficiencies of different steering systems are discussed and their influences on total drag and yacht manoeuvrability in different sailing directions is analysed. The discussion is focused on steering systems applicable in practice and accepted by the yacht-building industry, although several innovations could be found that remained on their development stage because of their complexity in construction, maintenance, use itself and reliability. All measurements have been conducted at sea applying on board sensors for position and accelerations acquirements.

50|$|Centre board - (also dagger board) an {{elongated}} underwater appendage that fits vertically {{in the slot}} of a centre case and extends below the hull.

This wave formation is accompanied by higher resistance and at a critical speed results in bow submergence or swamping. Three new shapes of hull bow design for the multipurpose amphibious vehicle were conducted at several speeds to investigate the hydrodynamic phenomena using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD, RANS code) which is applied by Ansys-CFX 14. 0 and Maxsurf. The vehicle’s <b>hydrodynamic</b> bow <b>shapes</b> were able to break up induced waves and avoid swamping. Comparative results with the vehicle fitted with U-shape, V-shape and Flat-shape of hull bow, showed that the U-shape of the hull bow has reduced the total resistance to 20. 3 % and 13. 6 % compared with the V-shape and flat shape respectively. Though, the U-shape of hull bow is capable to increase the amphibious operating life and speed of vehicle.
