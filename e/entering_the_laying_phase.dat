40|$|This {{research}} project consisted of five experiments. The main {{objective of this}} study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding and season on growth, carcass characteristics, meat chemical composition, reproduction and egg laying performance of Koekoek chickens. Feed restriction lowered the body weight, weight gain, feed intake and improved the feed conversion efficiency during the rearing <b>phase.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> chickens that were in the RA treatment had higher body weights, weight gains and lower FCR. Chickens that were reared in summer had a higher body weight, weight gain and FCR, while total feed intake and mortality rates were high in winter. Feed restriction reduced the slaughter weight, defeathered weight, dressed weight, skin weight, breast muscle weight, shank width, chest width and heart girth during the rearing phase. The intestine, liver and abdominal fat pad weights were higher in chickens that were fed ad libitum. Chickens that were reared in summer had higher shank width, slaughter weight, defeathered weight, chest width, heart girth, breast muscle weight, skin weight, abdominal fat pad weight, intestine weight, liver weight and the relative skin percentage at the age of 18 weeks. During <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> abdominal fat pad weight, abdominal fat pad percentage, intestine percentage, liver weight, gizzard weight and gizzard percentage were higher in the ad libitum fed chickens. Unrestricted feeding during the rearing phase increased the development of combs, wattles, pubic bones, ovaries and oviducts more than restricted feeding while at the age of 32 weeks, enhanced growth of the reproductive organs was seen in chickens that were fed ad libitum only during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> (RA). <b>The</b> cold winter conditions hindered the growth of the combs, wattles, pubic bones, oviducts and ovaries. Restricted feeding during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> reduced <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> percentage, egg weights and improved the hatching percentage. Ad libitum feeding during the rearing phase resulted in the attainment of puberty at an earlier age in chickens. Chickens that were produced in summer reached puberty first as well as 20 %, 50 % and 80 % egg production, and had a higher average laying percentage and egg weights.

For both experiments, the treatments were distributed in a randomized block design, at eight repetitions per treatment for the first one and six for the second one, both at 18 birds per repetition. During the first experiment, sexual maturity, laying percentage, marketable egg percentage, average egg weight and egg mass, in second experiment, feed consumption, final body weight, eggs per bird present, laying percentage, average egg weight, egg mass and alimentary conversion were evaluated.

40|$|Although {{functional}} {{explanations for}} female engagement in extra-pair copulation {{have been studied}} extensively in birds, {{little is known about}} how extra-pair paternity is linked to other fundamental aspects of avian reproduction. However, recent studies indicate that the occurrence of extra-pair offspring may generally decline with laying order, possibly because stimulation by eggs induces incubation, which may suppress female motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity. Here we tested whether experimental inhibition of incubation during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> induced by <b>the</b> temporary removal of eggs, resulted in increased extra-pair paternity, in concert with a later cessation of laying, in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). As expected, experimental females showed a more gradual increase in nocturnal incubation duration over <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> and produced larger clutches than controls. Moreover, incubation duration on the night after the first egg was laid predicted how extra-pair paternity declined with laying order, with less incubation being associated with more extra-pair offspring among the earliest eggs in the clutch. However, incubation duration on this first night was unrelated to our experimental treatment and independent of final clutch size. Consequently, the observed decline in extra-pair paternity with laying order was unaffected by our manipulation and larger clutches included proportionally fewer extra-pair offspring. We suggest that female physiological state prior to laying, associated with incubation at <b>the</b> onset of <b>laying,</b> determines motivation to acquire extra-pair paternity independent of final clutch size. This decline in proportion of extra-pair offspring with clutch size may be a general pattern within bird species. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} effects of additional fiber in the rearing phase diets on egg production, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) traits, and body measurements of brown egg-laying hens fed diets varying in energy concentration from 17 to 46 wk of age. The experiment was completely randomized with 10 treatments arranged as a 5 × 2 factorial with 5 rearing phase diets and 2 <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> diets. During <b>the</b> rearing phase, treatments consisted of a control diet based on cereals and soybean meal and 4 additional diets {{with a combination of}} 2 fiber sources (cereal straw and sugar beet pulp, SBP) at 2 levels (2 and 4 %). During <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> diets differed in energy content (2, 650 vs. 2, 750 kcal AMEn/kg) but had the same amino acid content per unit of energy. The rearing diet did not affect any production trait except egg production that was lower in birds fed SBP than in birds fed straw (91. 6 and 94. 1 %, respectively; P < 0. 05). <b>Laying</b> hens fed <b>the</b> high energy diet had lower feed intake (P < 0. 001), better feed conversion (P < 0. 01), and greater BW gain (P < 0. 05) than hens fed the low energy diet but egg production and egg weight were not affected. At 46 wk of age, none of the GIT traits was affected by previous dietary treatment. At this age, hen BW was positively related with body length (r = 0. 500; P < 0. 01), tarsus length (r = 0. 758; P < 0. 001), and body mass index (r = 0. 762; P < 0. 001) but no effects of type of diet on these traits were detected. In summary, the inclusion of up to 4 % of a fiber source in the rearing diets did not affect GIT development of the hens but SBP reduced egg production.

40|$|ABSTRACT Variation of {{behavior}} among hens and the relationships {{of behavior}} to measures of production and physical condition were investigated. The birds were 384 pullets from the mating of two stocks of males, obtained from a commercial breeder, to females from a third flock. The birds were housed as pairs in laying cages at 22 and 20 wk of age (Hatches 1 and 2, respectively). <b>The</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> was divided into 28 -day periods. In Periods 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, samples of hens were video recorded for 8 h. In Period 13, direct visual observations were made {{of the behavior of}} individually identified hens. Eleven production-related variables were recorded throughout <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase.</b> Feather scores were assessed in Periods 3, 6, 9, and 12. Body weight, lesions to the feet, and claw length were recorded in Periods 6 and 13. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between video-recorded behavioral variables and measures of production and physical condition. The data from direct visual observations were used for heritability estimates of behavioral traits. Eating and standing were positively correlated with egg production, whereas sitting and, for hens derived from male parental Stock 1, resting were negatively correlated with production. Inactivity also coincided with poorer plumage condition and higher body weight. For the offspring of male parental Stock 2, behavioral actions frequently performed in stereotyped manner, e. g., cage pecking and toe pecking, were positively associated with egg production. No significant additive genetic variation for behavior was evident among sires; however, for dams, fairly large heritability estimates occurred for a number of behavioral states. The apparent absence of additive genetic variability among sires for behavior may have been due to genetic fixation at gene loci which control behavior in the stocks acquired from the commercial breeder.

[...] Osteoporosis leads to the skeleton becoming fragile and an increased risk of bone breakage, particularly in the legs and keel bone. Fractures may occur whilst the hens are in the cage and these are usually discovered at depopulation as old, healed breaks, or they might be fresh breaks which occurred during the process of depopulation.

During the rearing phase (hatch to 17 wk of age), the BW of the albumen-deprived pullets was lower compared with the control and sham pullets. The feed intake of the albumen-deprived pullets was also lower than the control pullets.

40|$|In {{seasonally}} reproducing organisms, timing reproduction {{to match}} food availability {{is key to}} individual fitness. Ambient temperature functions as an important cue for {{the timing of the}} food peak in temperate-zone birds. After laying start, individual birds may still improve synchrony between offspring hatching and food availability by adjusting the onset of incubation to most up-to-date cues about the development of the food source. However, it is unknown whether individuals respond to changes in temperature after <b>the</b> onset of <b>laying,</b> and whether individuals adjust incubation onset independent of clutch size. Here, I show in free-living blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) that experimental heating of nestboxes in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> resulted in increased duration of nocturnal incubation bouts prior to clutch completion, leading to earlier hatching of eggs and increased hatching asynchrony.

These results are best explained as a response to increased temperature acting as a cue for an advanced food-peak, rather than a relief of energetic constraints, because improved energetic conditions would not favour more hatching asynchrony. Other benefits cannot be excluded, since increased laying-phase incubation under warmer conditions may also help maintain egg viability.

40|$|Os objetivos deste trabalho foram estimar as exigências de lisina e avaliar seus efeitos na fase de produção de ovos em 200 poedeiras leves (PL) Lohmann Selected Leghorn, e 200 poedeiras semipesadas (PSP) Isa Brown de 7 a 12 semanas. As aves foram distribuídas em delineamento em blocos ao acaso e alimentadas com ração basal contendo 16, 0 % de proteína bruta (PB) e 2900 kcal/kg de energia metabolizável (EM) suplementada com L-lisina HCl para os níveis de 0, 50; 0, 55; 0, 60; 0, 65; e 0, 70 % de lisina total nas rações. Na fase de postura, 160 aves de cada linhagem foram alimentadas com ração de produção contendo 16, 5 % de PB, 2900 kcal de EM, 2, 9 % de Ca+ 2 e 0, 755 % de lisina. As estimativas das exigências de lisina obtidas pelo ganho de peso, para a fase de 7 a 12 semanas de idade, foram de 0, 64 %, ou consumo de 368 mg diário para as PL, e de 0, 66 %, ou consumo de 395 mg diário para as PSP. Produção de ovos, conversão por massa e conversão por dúzia de ovos das linhagens foram afetadas de forma quadrática pelos níveis de lisina da ração. O consumo de ração das PL em produção foi afetado de forma quadrática e das PSP de forma linear. Durante a fase de crescimento, as PL apresentaram menor ganho de peso e consumo de ração e pior conversão alimentar que as PSP. Durante a fase de postura, as PSP apresentaram maiores produção e massa de ovos, menor consumo e melhores conversões por massa e por dúzia de ovos que as PL. The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to estimate the requirement of lysine from 7 to 12 weeks and to evaluate their effect on the egg production phase. Two hundred egg-white pullets (EW), and two hundred egg-brown pullets (EB) strains were allotted in randomized block design, and fed a basal diet with 16. 0 % of crude protein (CP) and 2, 900 kcal/kg metabolizable energy (ME), supplemented with L-lysine HCl for the level of 0. 50, 0. 55, 0. 60, 0. 65, and 0. 70 % of total lysine in the diet. In <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period, 160 birds from each trademark were fed with a production diet, contained 16. 5 % CP, 2, 900 kcal ME/kg, and 2. 9 % Ca+ 2 and 0. 755 % of lysine. The pullets requirement of lysine based on weight gain was 0. 64 % or intake of 368 mg daily for EW, and 0. 66 % or intake of 395 mg daily for EB. The egg production, egg mass and Feed: egg dozen of the two trademarks were affected by a quadratic relation by the lysine levels in the diet. The feed intake of EW during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> was affected by a quadratic relation, and EB was affected by linear relation. During the growing phase, the EW presented lower weight gain and feed intake and the worst feed:gain ratio than EB. During <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> <b>the</b> EB showed higher egg production and egg mass, lower feed intake and better egg mass and feed:egg dozen than EW...|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of fowl pox, which occurred in south-eastern Ontario between July 1988 and April 1989, {{was investigated in}} the spring of 1989 to determine factors associated with the spread of the disease. Clinical fowl pox was confirmed on five farms (cases). Twenty-seven farms, out of 35 egg producers with quota from Durham region to Northumberland county, provided information as controls. Bivariate analyses were performed on mail survey data using Fisher's exact test and odds ratios. Although the tests of hypotheses lacked statistical power because of the small number of case farms, and barns, a number of significant associations were found. At the farm level, fowl pox infection was associated with pullets purchased from a particular pullet grower. At the barn level, fowl pox infection was associated with pullets from a particular grower, mixing different groups of pullets, and a trend towards having birds early in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> period, and higher numbers of birds placed. Fowl pox-infected barns had higher mortality and lower egg production postoutbreak. The results may indicate that <b>the</b> virus <b>enters</b> <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> barn at, or near, the time new birds are placed. Better communication among producers, catch-and-fill crews, and others associated with the egg industry, as well as more complete records of dates, sources, and persons involved with pullet placements, are recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the chlorine nutritional requirement of Japanese Quails during <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase,</b> based on performance and egg quality parameters. A total of 240 Japanese quails were distributed according to a randomized block design, with five treatments and six replicates, with 8 birds each. The experiment lasted 84 days, divided in four cycles of 21 days each. Treatments consisted of a basal diet formulated to meet the nutritional requirements, except for chlorine, and four supplementation levels with ammonium chloride, generating the levels 0. 8; 1. 6; 2. 4; 3. 2 and 4. 0 g/kg. The parameters evaluated were: feed intake (g/bird/day), egg production (egg/bird/day), egg weight (g), egg mass (g), egg mass conversion (g/g), conversion per dozen eggs (kg/dz), weight of yolk (g/ 100 g of egg), albumen (g/ 100 g of egg) and shell (g/ 100 g of egg), specific gravity (g/cm³) and shell thickness (mm). As a result of this study, feed intake, egg weight, weights of albumen, yolk, shell and specific gravity were not affected by treatments. There was a quadratic behavior for egg production, egg mass, egg mass conversion, conversion per dozen eggs and shell thickness according to the chlorine levels in the diets, with the requirements for those parameters established at 1. 54; 1. 37; 1. 39 and 2. 78 g/kg, respectively. The recommendation is 1. 39 g/kg of chlorine and 244. 22 mEq/kg of electrolyte balance in diets for Japanese quails...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study effect of feed restriction during growing period on the subsequent performance of commercial White Leghorn (Babcock) layers. Two hundred and seventy chicks (6 -weeks-old) were randomly divided into three equal groups i. e., A, B and C. The birds in group A were given feed ad libitum (full feeding -FF) while those in groups Sand C maintained on the restricted feeding (RF) were given 10 and 20 percent less feed than the recommended daily feed allowance, respectively from 7 to 9 and 13 to 15 weeks and 20 and 30 percent lesser feed respectively, of the daily allowance from 10 tol 2 weeks of age. From 6 weeks onward til 158 weeks of age all the groups were fed ad libitum. The results showed reduction (p< 0. 01) in feed intake and body weight (p< 0. 05) of pullets and delay in age of sexual maturity (p< 0. 01) due to feed restriction. During <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> a non-significant effect of the feed restriction programme on egg production, feed consumption, feed conversion efficiency (feed/dozen eggs), mortality rate and cost of feed/dozen eggs was noted. An overall benefit of Rs. 13. 54 and 21. 54 on RF-I (group-B) and RF-II (group-C), respectively, in comparison to that of FF during the growing period reflect on better economics of feed restriction programme in laying stock under given environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{summarizes}} recent {{findings on}} management approaches that reduce feather pecking in laying hens. Results from epidemiological studies {{as well as}} studies on single factors have been taken into account, from the period of 2005 up till now and older studies have been included where relevant. Feather pecking in laying hens is still a major problem {{and because of the}} development of an increasing number of flocks housed in non-cage systems and a possible future ban on beak trimming in some countries it is important to define effective management strategies. In general, recent studies provide additional evidence for factors associated with an increased or reduced risk for feather pecking compared with earlier work in this field. It has been confirmed that the rearing period is very important to prevent feather pecking in <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase.</b> Management factors associated with a reduced risk for severe feather pecking are a reduced stocking density, diets with increased fibre contents, mash instead of pelleted feed, reduced light intensity, presence of good quality substrate, access to attractive outdoor runs and providing environmental enrichment to stimulate foraging and exploration behaviour. As feather pecking is a multifactorial problem, the interaction between management factors and between management and the genetic background of the bird is important and an area for further research. In addition, the transfer of knowledge from scientific studies to commercial practice an issue that should receive attention...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Estimate the {{seroprevalence}} {{of influenza}} A virus in various commercial poultry farms and evaluate specific risk factors {{as well as}} analyze their genetic nature using molecular assays. Materials and Methods: This report summarizes {{the findings of a}} national survey realized from October 2010 to May 2011 on 800 flocks in 20 governorates. Serum samples were screened for the presence of specific influenza virus antibodies using cELISA test. Additionally, swab samples were tested by real time and conventional RT-PCR and compared with results obtained by others assays. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses of the glycoproteins were established for some strains. Results: Out of the 800 chicken and turkey flocks tested by cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies (28. 7 %, 95 % CI: 25. 6 – 32. 1). Significantly higher seroprevalence was found among the coastal areas compared to inland and during the autumn and winter. Broiler flocks showed significantly lower seroprevalence than layers and broiler breeders. The influenza virus infection prevalence increased after <b>the</b> <b>laying</b> <b>phase</b> among layer flocks. In addition, AIV seropositivity was significantly associated with low biosecurity measures. The Ag EIA and rRT-PCR tests revealed significantly higher numbers of AI positive samples as compared to cell cultures or egg inoculation. All new strains were subtyped as H 9 N 2 by real time and conventional RT-PCR. Drift mutations, addition or deletion of glycosylation sites were likely to have occurred in the HA and NA glycoproteins of Tunisian strains resulting in multiple new amino acid substitutions. This fact may reflect differen...|$|R
