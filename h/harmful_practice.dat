50|$|In the {{old days}} of {{traditional}} manufacturing, steel and other metals arrived at factories in a raw, untreated, unpainted state. Companies would fabricate and paint or treat the metal components of their product before assembly. This was a costly, time-consuming, and environmentally <b>harmful</b> <b>practice.</b> The coil coating process was pioneered in the 1930s for painting, coating and pre-treating large coils of metals before they ever arrived at a manufacturing facility.

50|$|Third, {{there is}} an {{objection}} that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the <b>harmful</b> <b>practice</b> of blackface. Tuvel distinguishes between problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification {{is not based on}} a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; it {{does not appear to be}} temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.|$|E

50|$|Upon examination, however, Lovisa Åhrberg {{was deemed}} to have {{sufficient}} medical knowledge {{for the practice}} she was conducting and free from all forms of <b>harmful</b> <b>practice.</b> She was thereby acquitted from quackery and given permission to practice medicine, {{despite the fact that}} this was formally banned for females. Her position could be compared with that of her contemporary Amalia Assur, who was given special dispensation to practice dentistry despite {{the fact that this was}} in fact prohibited for females. An additional reason for her acquittal was the fact that Åhrberg was foremost active as a surgeon, and that the medicals she offered her patients for inner illnesses were normally natural herbals.|$|E
5000|$|Pornography {{has been}} found to {{desensitize}} societies to violence against women, inspiring rapes and contributing to the sexual subordination of women to men (2009). Making their materials, pornographers exploit existing inequality between the sexes to coerce women and children to perform unwanted or dangerous sexual acts as a form of prostitution. Existing legal regulations in democratic societies have not approached pornography with these realities in mind, but usually rather as a right protected by freedom of expression, or as an [...] "obscene" [...] expression offending the public rather than harming any particular group. In rare but important instances, pornography has legally been seen as a <b>harmful</b> <b>practice</b> violating women's human or democratic rights to equality.|$|E
5000|$|This paste {{is similar}} to black salve or [...] "Hoxsey's paste" [...] (see Hoxsey Therapy), a {{fraudulent}} patent medicine, but its usage is different. Hoxsey used the paste for long periods, a <b>harmful</b> <b>practice</b> that was rapidly discredited. Mohs left the paste on the wound only overnight, and the following day, the cancer and surrounding skin would be anesthetized and the cancer removed. The specimen was then excised, and the tissue examined under the microscope. If cancer remained, more paste was applied, and the patient would return the following day. Later, local anesthetic and frozen section histopathology applied to fresh tissue allowed the procedure to be performed the same day, with less tissue destruction, and similar cure rate. The term [...] "chemosurgery" [...] remains today, and is used synonymously with Mohs micrographic surgery.|$|E

40|$|For decades feminists {{worldwide}} {{have addressed}} and combated the <b>harmful</b> <b>practice</b> of female genital mutilation, while largely overlooking male circumcision as genital mutilation.

This paper focuses on circumcision of non-consenting male minors, arguing that it is genital mutilation and that the practice should be a feminist issue, as well as a human rights concern.
