2500|$|Watson {{has said}} that Hermione is a {{character}} who makes [...] "brain not beauty cool," [...] and that though Hermione is [...] "slightly socially inept," [...] she is [...] "not ashamed of herself." [...] When filming Chamber of Secrets, Watson was [...] "adamant" [...] that she wasn't like Hermione, but she reflects that [...] "as I got older, I realised she was the greatest role model a girl could have." [...] In 2007, before the release of Order of the Phoenix, Watson said, [...] "There are too many stupid girls in the media. Hermione's not scared to be clever. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit, and that's bad. When I was nine or ten, I would get really upset {{when they tried to}} make me look geeky, but now I absolutely love it. I find it's so much pressure to be beautiful. Hermione doesn't care what she looks like. She's a complete tomboy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Your shoe can't pinch {{you very}} bad, <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of you {{it seems that}} you are an {{embodiment}} of prosperity and happiness." ...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{characters}} Epstein portrayed were troubled types. He said, [...] "I'm a pretty upbeat person. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> get cast as these brooding types because I bring light and joy, which hopefully makes them more likable." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lucy nodded. [...] "I saw you understood. Before we met I {{was rather}} jealous of you--and curious. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Lawrence <b>sometimes</b> makes {{mistakes}} about people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely not. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> we are {{inclined}} to put many things on the devil's shoulders which ought to rest on our own. You know what the Bible says about the deceitfulness of our hearts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is to be}} here on Monday. I haven't {{seen him}} for more than twelve years; and now he's to be here next week? Dear, dear! When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> of all the hard words that have been spoken, and the harder {{thoughts}} {{that have been in}} people's minds, I often regret that the money ever came to me at all. I could have done without it, very well,--very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} now, but {{a week or}} two one way or {{the other}} makes no difference. Here is Terence, just sixteen, who ought to be at school trying to get a little learning into his head, laying down the law to his supeyrior officers, just because he has had the luck to get onto the brigadier's staff. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> that the world is coming to an end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mr. Vigil, why {{is there}} no choice? You must draw the line somewhere. Do forgive me for saying that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you <b>sometimes</b> waste your time." ...|$|R
6000|$|She got up. [...] "Jims {{has had a}} nightmare, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> He <b>sometimes</b> has one and he {{is always}} badly frightened by it. Excuse me for a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Girls, <b>I</b> believe, <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{that men}} are {{indifferent}} in their love. They suppose that a man can forget it at once {{when he is not}} accepted, and that things can go on just as before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{feel at home}} here, {{more so than in}} {{any place}} since I left England; but I hope that I may be able to spend longer {{intervals}} in the islands than the mere sixteen or eighteen weeks of the voyage, if I have still my health and strength. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> that I can't last always; I unconsciously leave off doing things, and wake up to find that I am shirking work.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Master Helstrop, Master Helstrop!' cried Jeffreys, {{shaking his}} great wig until the powder {{flew out of}} it; 'you are in all these dirty cases, Master Helstrop. You might find {{yourself}} in a parlous condition, Master Helstrop. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> that I see you yourself in the dock, Master Helstrop. You may yourself soon need {{the help of a}} gentleman of the long robe, Master Helstrop. Oh, have a care! Have a care!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, Harry; I know," [...] Jeanne {{said with}} her eyes full of tears. [...] "Do not think that I am ungrateful because I talk so. I am always {{thinking}} how wrong {{it is that you}} should be staying here risking your life for us instead of going home to those who love you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> Virginie and I ought to give ourselves up, and then you could go home." [...] And Jeanne burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Docharty!" [...] said I (this was {{the name}} of an old priest, an Irishman, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> who <b>sometimes</b> officiated at Osbaldistone Hall)--"I thought Father Vaughan had been at the Hall. He was here yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mysie, {{coming up}} close to her mother as they all went up the broad {{staircase}} {{to prepare for the}} midday meal, confessed in a grave little voice, 'Mamma, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>sometimes</b> been cross to Dolly-more lately, because it has been so very tiresome.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Caroline did {{not seem}} vexed by the inquiry, but went on {{speaking}} rather {{as if she was}} examining herself as to the answer,--"Love him? I don't know; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not. It is not as people in books love, and--and it can't be as your Agnes must love Mr. Arundel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] said Mrs. Tulliver, {{stroking}} her dress down, [...] "I've seen what riches {{are in my}} own family; for my sisters have got husbands as can afford to do pretty much what they like. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> I shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation; and my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don't {{know what it is}} to marry a man like your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has her own way from morning till night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A home thrust," [...] she declared, laughing. [...] "I {{suppose that}} is a subject upon which I have some glimmerings of knowledge. Really not very much, though, but then I have a theory about that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> that the clearest {{judgments}} are formed by some one who comes a little fresh to a subject, some one who hasn't been dabbling in it half their lifetime and acquired prejudices. Do you always provide strawberries for your guests, Lord Dorminster? If so, I should like to come and live here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not doubt}} that, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{that it is}} not the right kind of love. It is too savage. No man should be made a {{prisoner}} for no other reason than that he is loved by a woman. I have tried to teach you many things; the language of my people, their ways and thoughts, but I have failed to civilize you. I cannot make you understand that it is unwomanly--do not turn away. I am not indifferent. I have learned to care for you. Your beauty and tenderness have made anything else impossible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes! I feel better--that is to say, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>Sometimes</b> I do, and {{sometimes}} I don't. You know, Polly, I came on this voyage chiefly {{on account of}} my health, and of course I must expect {{to be a little}} damaged by so much exposure, though your good father has indeed done his best to shelter me. Why, do you know, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> the berth he has made for me between the logs here is a greater triumph of his inventive genius than your bower. <b>I</b> often <b>think</b> they spoiled a splendid engineer when they made your father a sailor." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Poor Crichton! <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> he {{is losing}} {{his sense of}} humour. Come along, Agatha.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> {{we must be}} all mad {{and that}} we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall {{remember}} about Miss Mackenzie's memoir of that good Mrs. Robertson. I wonder {{that men are}} not found to help Mr. Robertson. Here, as you know, the climate (as in Central Africa) is our difficulty. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> I make too much of it, but really I don't see how a man is to stand many months of it. But I can't help thinking and hoping that if that difficulty did not exist I could see my way to saying, [...] "Now, a missionary is wanted for these four or five or six islands, one for each, and a younger man as fellow-helper to that missionary," [...] {{and they would be}} forthcoming.|$|E
6000|$|Marcia {{looked at}} her attentively, {{as if this were}} all a very hard saying. [...] "Yes, I've heard of that. Some of the girls had it at school. But I never did. Well," [...] she said at last, [...] "I don't feel so anxious about myself, just at present, as I do about Flavia. I want to do {{everything}} I can for Flavia, Mrs. Halleck. I want her to be christened,--I want her to be baptized into some church. I think a good deal about it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes,</b> what if she should die, and I hadn't done that for her, when may be {{it was one of the}} most important things--" [...] Her voice shook, and she pressed her lips together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another {{reason for}} your going to England {{is that your}} {{grandfather}} may, if he is dead, have relented at last towards your father, and may have left him some share in his fortune; and although you might well refuse to accept any help from him, if he is alive, you can have no hesitation in taking that which should be yours by right. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> now, my boy, that I have been wrong in not accepting the fact of your father's death as proved, and taking you home to England; but you will believe that I acted for the best, and I shrank from the thought of going home as a beggar, while I could maintain you and myself comfortably, here." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{there are}} two sorts of faith; and one must always, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think,</b> come before the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. They <b>sometimes</b> {{seem to be}} {{like the}} apples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound--a few blighted." ...|$|R
60|$|HILLCRIST. Yes. But {{you don't}} love {{the place as}} I do, Jill. You youngsters don't love anything, <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think.</b>|$|R
60|$|That {{propensity}} of lifting every problem {{from the plane}} of the understandable by means of some sort of mystic expression, is very Russian. I knew her well enough to have discovered her scorn for all the practical forms of political liberty known to the western world. I suppose one must be a Russian to understand Russian simplicity, a terrible corroding simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe a naive and hopeless cynicism. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> that the psychological secret of the profound difference of that people consists in this, that they detest life, the irremediable life of the earth as it is, whereas we westerners cherish it with perhaps an equal exaggeration of its sentimental value. But this is a digression indeed....|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have taught}} myself, sir," [...] Harry said. [...] "Father is awfully good, and often picks up books {{for me at}} old bookstalls. Of course {{sometimes}} he gets things I can't make out. But he got twelve once for a shilling, {{and there was a}} Latin Grammar and Dictionary among them; and when I had learned the Grammar, it was very easy with the Dictionary to make out the sense of some of the Latin books. But of course I often come across things that I don't understand. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> if some one would explain them to me once or twice, so that I could really understand how the rules in the Grammar are applied, I could get on faster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, sir, go and see! How can a man {{be a man}} {{in those}} crowded styes, {{sleeping}} packed together like Irish pigs in a steamer, never out {{of the fear of}} want, never knowing any higher amusement than the beer-shop? Those old Greeks and Romans, as I read, were more like men than half our English labourers. Go and see! Ask that sweet heavenly angel, Miss Honoria,'--and the keeper again blushed,--'And she, too, will tell you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>sometimes</b> if she had been born and bred like her father's tenants' daughters, to sleep where they sleep, and hear the talk they hear, and see the things they see, what would she have been now? We mustn't think of it.' And the keeper turned his head away, and fairly burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wisht I {{knew what}} ter do. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> orter tell {{somebody}} that knows more'n I do, Josie, if I ever blab at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] John admitted, frowning. [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he is, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> {{am not so}} sure. At any rate, he {{has been}} very kind to me." ...|$|R
60|$|BRIDGET [considering]. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about nothing. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> {{wonder if}} the pig is {{fattening}} well, or I go out {{to see if the}} crows are picking up the chickens' food.|$|R
