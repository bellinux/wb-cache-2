40|$|The {{survival}} {{and function of}} retinal neurons is dependent on mitochondrial energy generation and its intracellular distribution by creatine kinase. Post ischemic disruption of retinal creatine synthesis, creatine kinase activity, or transport of creatine into neurons may impair retinal function. S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe) is required for creatine synthesis, phosphatidylcholine and glutathione synthesis, and transducin methylation. These reactions are essential for photoreceptor function but may be downregulated after ischemia due {{to a reduction in}} SAMe. Our aim was to determine whether administration of SAMe after ischemia could improve retinal function. Unilateral retinal ischemia was induced in adult rats by increasing the intraocular pressure to 110 mm Hg for 60 min. Immediately after the ischemic insult, SAMe was injected into the vitreous (100 μm), followed by oral administration (69 mg/kg/day) for 5 or 10 days. Retinal function (electroretinography), histology, and creatine transporter (CRT- 1) expression were analyzed. Photoreceptoral responses (RmP 3, <b>S),</b> <b>rod</b> and cone bipolar cell responses (PII), and oscillatory potentials were reduced by the ischemia/reperfusion insult. Although SAMe treatment ameliorated the ischemia-induced histological damage by day 5, there was no improvement in retinal function and the intensity of CRT- 1 labeling in ischemic retinas was markedly reduced. However, 10 days after ischemia, a recovery in CRT- 1 immunolabeling was evident and SAMe supplementation significantly restored photoreceptor function and rod PII responses. In conclusion, these data suggest that creatine transport and methylation reactions, such as creatine synthesis, may be compromised by an ischemic insult contributing to retinal dysfunction and injury. Oral SAMe supplementation after retinal ischemia may provide an effective, safe, and accessible neuroprotective strategy...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF JONATHAN WAYNE LANGENFELD, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Mechanical Engineering and Energy Processes, {{presented}} on 28 October 2010, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: WAVE PROPAGATION AND VIBRATION OF SPRING-MASS SYSTEMS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Serge Abrate 	The {{main focus of}} this research was to study wave propagation and modeling techniques of spring-mass systems. The purpose is to show that by engineering a materials microstructure, the material can have wave filtering capabilities. Numerical solutions were obtained for the steady-state response of a uniform, alternating, and branched spring-mass chain. The spring-mass chains studied were excited by harmonic forces; it is shown how gaps exist in the frequency ranges which {{can be applied to the}} chain, to filter wave propagation. The spring-mass chains were modeled as a continuum being governed by the wave equation or higher order models such as Love 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rod</b> theory. It was concluded that the best agreement was found between the spring-mass chain and the continuum models when excited by very low frequencies. 	Transient response problems are addressed for uniform materials, sandwiched materials, laminates, and graded materials. Analytical solutions for the response to these problems are presented along with numerical solutions using the finite element method. Step and impulse loading cases are studied to monitor if and how the initial wave pulse distorts upon propagation through a material. Underwater blast loading cases are studied which model water as a uniform bar transmitting waves into the hull of a sea going vessel. 	Results are presented for one-dimensional cloaking scenarios. Cloaking models are created from basic two component models and increased to four component models. Analytical and numerical solutions are obtained proving that the magnitude of reflected waves can be reduced by gradually decreasing the wave speed with each added layer. All of the results obtained throughout this research agree that the microstructure of a material can be engineered to control wave propagation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHistorically, it {{was assumed}} that the light-evoked neural signals driving the human pupillary light reflex (PLR) {{originated}} exclusively from rod and cone photoreceptors. However, a novel melanopsin-containing photoreceptive cell class has recently been discovered in the mammalian retina. These intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) project to the pretectum, the retinorecipient area of the brain responsible for the PLR. This study was therefore designed to examine the relative contribution of rod, cone and the melanopsin photoresponses of ipRGCs to the human PLR. We establish that the melanopsin photoresponse of ipRGCs contributes significantly to the maintenance of half maximal pupilloconstriction in response to light stimuli of 30 s or longer, even at low photopic irradiances. Furthermore, we show that the melanopsin photoresponse contributes significantly to three-quarter maximal pupilloconstriction in response to light stimuli as short as 2 s. We also demonstrate that cone photoresponses driving pupilloconstriction adapt considerably and contribute little after 30 <b>s,</b> but <b>rod</b> photoresponses adapt less and contribute significantly to the maintenance of pupilloconstriction in response to steady-state light stimuli at irradiance levels which are below the threshold of the melanopsin photoresponse...|$|R
