40|$|Cells exhibiting {{decreased}} topoisomerase II (Topo II) {{activity are}} resistant to several drugs that require Topo II as an intermediate. These drugs are cytotoxic due {{to the formation of}} a cleavable complex between the drug, Topo II and DNA. <b>Fostriecin</b> belongs to a new class of drugs that inhibit Topo II without inducing the formation of this cleavable complex. We tested <b>fostriecin</b> in three human small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines. GLC 4 is the parent line. GLC 4 /ADR is the P-glycoprotein-negative multidrug-resistant subline, which is resistant to several Topo II inhibitors due to its decreased Topo II activity. GLC 4 /cDDP is the cisplatin-resistant subline, which displays increased Topo II activity. Topo II activity proved to be 100 % in GLC 4, 35 % in GLC 4 /ADR and 130 % in GLC 4 /cDDP. The <b>fostriecin</b> concentration causing inhibition of the growth of 50 % of the cells (IC 50) in the microculture tetrazolium assay following continuous incubation was 11. 2, 4. 1 and 14. 9 microM, respectively.

Our results indicate a relationship between Topo II activity and <b>fostriecin</b> sensitivity in these closely related cell lines. At least in vitro, <b>fostriecin</b> displayed the capacity to kill cells showing resistance to drugs due to decreased Topo II activity. There was no relationship between this capacity and an increase in the activity of the reduced-folate carrier system, the proposed mechanism for cellular entry of <b>fostriecin,</b> since we found no correlation between the cytotoxicity of <b>fostriecin</b> and that of methotrexate...|$|E
40|$|SummaryFostriecin is {{a unique}} {{phosphate}} monoester antibiotic that was isolated from Streptomyces pulveraceus as a protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) and PP 4 A selective inhibitor. However, its biosynthetic mechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, a 73 kb gene cluster encoding a six modular Type I polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven tailoring enzymes was identified by cosmid sequencing from the producer. The functions of two tailoring enzymes were characterized by gene disruption and an in vitro enzyme activity assay. Remarkably, the isolation of three malonylated <b>fostriecin</b> analogs from post-PKS gene knockout mutants indicated malonylated-polyketide formation could be a normal biosynthetic process in the formation of the unsaturated six-membered lactone in <b>fostriecin.</b> Based on this study, a comprehensive post-PKS modification mechanism for <b>fostriecin</b> biosynthesis was proposed...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a phase I and pharmacokinetic {{study of the}} topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor <b>fostriecin.</b> <b>Fostriecin</b> was administered intravenously over 60 min on days 1 – 5 at 4 -week intervals. Dose was escalated from 2 mg m− 2 day− 1 to 20 mg m− 2 day− 1 in 20 patients. Drug pharmacokinetics was analysed with high performance liquid chromatography with UV-detection. Plasma collected during drug administration was tested in vitro for growth inhibition of a teniposide-resistant small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line. The predominant toxicities were elevated liver transaminases (maximum common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 4) and serum creatinine (maximum CTC grade 2). These showed only a limited increase with increasing doses, often recovered during drug administration and were fully reversible. Duration of elevated alanine–amino transferase (ALT) was dose-limiting in one patient at 20 mg m− 2. Other frequent toxicities were grade 1 – 2 nausea/vomiting, fever and mild fatigue. Mean <b>fostriecin</b> plasma half-life was 0. 36 h (initial; 95 % CI, 0 – 0. 76 h) and 1. 51 h (terminal; 95 % CI, 0. 41 – 2. 61 h). A metabolite, most probably dephosphorylated <b>fostriecin,</b> was detected in plasma and urine. No tumour responses were observed, but the plasma concentrations reached in the patients were insufficient to induce significant growth inhibition in vitro. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been reached, because drug supply was stopped at the 20 mg m− 2 dose level. However, further escalation seems possible and is warranted to achieve potentially effective drug levels. <b>Fostriecin</b> has a short plasma half-life and longer duration of infusion should be considered. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Fostriecin</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of topoisomerase II catalytic activity. In a phase I trial {{we observed}} renal toxicity, documented as {{a rise in}} serum creatinine, which was reversible and non-dose-limiting. The {{purpose of this study}} was a detailed analysis of this toxicity. Methods: A total of 20 patients received <b>fostriecin</b> as a 1 -h i. v. infusion daily x 5 at doses ranging from 2 to 20 mg/m(2) per day. Serum creatinine determination and urinalysis were performed daily during drug administration. Renal hemodynamics were measured by means of clearance studies using I- 125 -iothalamate and I- 131 -hippuran in eight patients at doses of greater than or equal to 4 mg/m(2) per day at baseline, on day 3 or 4 during the first course, and 3 weeks after the second course. Results: The rise in serum creatinine was maximal after one to two doses despite continued administration. This increase showed no correlation with the dose level at <b>fostriecin</b> doses of greater than or equal to 4 mg/m(2) per day. Urinary beta(2) -microglobulin concentrations increased 150 -fold (median), which is compatible with impaired tubular reabsorption. The median change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was - 36 % (range - 28 % to - 44 %), that in effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was - 23 % (range - 11 % to - 36 %), and the filtration fraction (FF) decreased in all patients during the first course of treatment. The values measured 3 weeks after the second course, however, did not differ from baseline.

40|$|<b>Fostriecin</b> and cytostatin are {{structurally}} related natural inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases, with promising antitumor activity. The total {{synthesis of}} these antitumor agents has enabled {{the production of}} structural analogs, which are useful to explore the biological significance of features contained in the parent compounds. Here, the inhibitory activity of <b>fostriecin,</b> cytostatin, and 10 key structural analogs were tested in side-by-side phosphatase assays to further characterize their inhibitory activity against PP 1 c (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit), PP 2 Ac (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2 A catalytic subunit), PP 5 c (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5 catalytic subunit), and chimeras of PP 1 (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 1) and PP 5 (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 5), in which key residues predicted for inhibitor contact with PP 2 A (Ser/Thr protein phosphatase 2 A) were introduced into PP 1 and PP 5 using site-directed mutagenesis. The data confirm {{the importance of the}} C 9 -phosphate and C 11 -alcohol for general inhibition and further demonstrate the importance of a predicted C 3 interaction with a unique cysteine (Cys 269) in the β 12 –β 13 loop of PP 2 A. The data also indicate that additional features beyond the unsaturated lactone contribute to inhibitory potency and selectivity. Notably, a derivative of <b>fostriecin</b> lacking the entire lactone subunit demonstrated marked potency and selectivity for PP 2 A, while having substantially reduced and similar activity against PP 1 and PP 1 /PP 2 A- PP 5 /PP 2 A-chimeras that have greatly increased sensitivity to both <b>fostriecin</b> and cytostatin. This suggests that other features [e. g., the (Z,Z,E) -triene] also contribute to inhibitory selectivity. When considered together with previous data, these studies suggest that, despite the high structural conservation of the catalytic site in PP 1, PP 2 A and PP 5, the development of highly selective catalytic inhibitors should be feasible...|$|E

Camptothecin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, blocks replicative DNA synthesis immediately but incompletely, suggesting a participation of topoisomerase I at the replication fork, but it, too, has no influence on DNA repair.

To explore the role of protein phosphatase in central sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons following peripheral noxious stimulation, using electrophysiological recording techniques, we investigated the role of two inhibitors of protein phosphatase type 2 A (PP 2 A), <b>fostriecin</b> and okadaic acid (OA), on the responses of dorsal horn neurons to mechanical stimuli in anesthetized rats following intradermal injection of capsaicin. Central sensitization was initiated by injection of capsaicin into the plantar surface of the left paw. A microdialysis fiber was implanted in the spinal cord dorsal horn for perfusion of ACSF and inhibitors of PP 2 A, <b>fostriecin</b> and okadaic acid.

Chromosome condensation {{can also be}} induced by treating interphase cells with the protein phosphatase 1 and 2 A inhibitors okadaic acid and <b>fostriecin.</b> Mouse mammary tumour FT 210 cells grow normally at 32 degrees C, but at 39 degrees C they lose p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity and arrest in G 2 because of a temperature-sensitive lesion in the cdc 2 gene. The treatment of these G 2 -arrested FT 210 cells with <b>fostriecin</b> or okadaic acid resulted in full chromosome condensation {{in the absence of}} p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity or histone H 1 hyperphosphorylation. However, phosphorylation of histones H 2 A and H 3 was strongly stimulated, partly through inhibition of histone H 2 A and H 3 phosphatases, and cyclins A and B were degraded. The cells were unable to complete mitosis and divide. In the presence of the protein kinase inhibitor starosporine, the addition of <b>fostriecin</b> did not induce histone phosphorylation and chromosome condensation. The results show that chromosome condensation can take place without either the histone H 1 hyperphosphorylation or the p 34 cdc 2 kinase activity normally associated with mitosis, although it requires a staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase activity. The results further suggest that protein phosphatases 1 and 2 A may be important in regulating chromosome condensation by restricting the level of histone phosphorylation during interphase, thereby preventing premature chromosome condensation...|$|E

Inhibition of PP 2 A with <b>fostriecin</b> or calyculin A significantly increased MEK phosphorylation, as did {{exposure to the}} p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580. Inhibition of MEK potentiated TNF-induced caspase- 3 activity and cell death, and both those events were suppressed by treatment with <b>fostriecin</b> or calyculin A.

40|$|Chapter 1 While {{targeting}} kinases in oncology {{research has}} been explored extensively, targeting protein phosphatases is currently in its infancy. However, a number of pharmaceutical companies are currently looking to expand their research efforts in this area. PP 2 A {{has been shown to}} down-regulate ERK 5, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) that {{has been shown to be}} important in driving the invasive phenotype of prostate cancer. <b>Fostriecin</b> and its related structural analogues PD 113, 270 and 113, 271 have been shown to inhibit a mitotic entry checkpoint in cell growth through the potent and selective inhibition of protein phosphatases PP 1, PP 2 A, and PP 4 (IC 50 of 45 μM, 1. 5 nM, and 3 nM respectively). <b>Fostriecin</b> is one of the most selective protein phosphatase inhibitors disclosed to date with a 104 fold selectivity for PP 2 A/PP 4 versus PP 1. Unfortunately, <b>fostriecin</b> and its analogues are very unstable, and this instability has effectively prevented them from being used as effective therapeutic leads. The microcystins and nodularins on the other hand, exhibit significant inhibitory activity against PP 1 and PP 2 A (IC 50 = 26 pM and 1. 8 nM respectively), but their high toxicity has prevented any therapeutic application. Truncation of the ADDA chain from these polypeptides completely attenuates PP inhibitory activity. Simpler analogues incorporating the N-acylated ADDA chain and D-Ala retain moderate activity against PP 1 and PP 2 A (IC 50 = 1. 0 μM and 0. 17 μM respectively). The generation of a new series of <b>fostriecin</b> analogues to further expand its structure-activity relationship is envisaged with a view to creating new more stable PP 2 A inhibitors. It was hoped that by incorporating some of the more stable structural features of ADDA into <b>fostriecin</b> that stability and activity could be reconciled. With that in mind a series of PP 2 A inhibitors were synthesised and biologically evaluated. Chapter 2 GPCRs are an important area of research and are the targets of a quarter of the drugs on the market (2005). As a result, GPCRs continue to be at the forefront of research in both small and large drug companies. However one of the difficulties in studying this diverse class of membrane proteins is their tendency to denature in aqueous solution. As a result there is a pressing need to develop new detergents to solubilise, stabilise and crystallise GPCRs in their native form for further study. Cholesterol analogues have been shown to be important for stabilising membrane proteins and preventing their thermal inactivation. In addition the β 2 -adrenergic receptor, a GPCR membrane protein, has been crystallised in the active state with two cholesterol molecules bound between the I, II, III and IV helices of the protein. This appears to represent a distinct cholesterol binding pocket on the membrane protein that is speculated to be conserved across up to 44...|$|E

Whether CK 2 may also affect memory formation and whether CK 2 interacts with Akt and SGK 1 during this process is unknown. In the present study, we found that water maze training significantly decreased CK 2 activity in the rat hippocampal CA 1 area but not in the dentate gyrus (DG) area. Transfection of the dominant negative mutant of CK 2, CK 2 �A 156,tothe CA 1 area, but not to the DG area, decreased CK 2 activity but enhanced spatial memory formation. Meanwhile, it increased SGK 1 phosphorylation at Ser 422, decreased Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473, and increased cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation at Ser 133. Transfection of the constitutively active SGK 1, SGKS 422 D, enhanced whereas transfection of the wild-type Akt impaired spatial memory formation. Also, administration of the protein phosphatase 2 A inhibitor, <b>fostriecin,</b> reversed the memory-impairing effect of CK 2 �WT.

Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation was moderately increased by CK 2 �WT and <b>fostriecin</b> treatment, but AktS 473 A mutant transfection reversed the memory-impairing effect of CK 2 �WT.

A pivotal regulatory mechanism of FOXO is reversible phosphorylation, catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases. Phosphorylation of FOXO 1 is associated with 14 - 3 - 3 binding and cytosolic localization, whereas dephosphorylated FOXO 1 translocates to the nucleus and is transcriptionally active. Experiments were performed to identify the serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates FOXO 1. PP 2 A inhibitors, okadaic acid and <b>fostriecin,</b> increased FOXO 1 phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Microcystin-agarose pull-downs suggested that a phosphatase binds to FOXO 1, and PP 2 A catalytic subunit was identified in endogenous FOXO 1 immunocomplexes, indicating that PP 2 A is a FOXO 1 phosphatase.

40|$|The viral {{replication}} rate in patients infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) is controlled in part by regulation of the transcription of viral genes. The rate of transcription is determined by a complex interplay between cellular and viral proteins and the promoter elements found in the long terminal repeats. Protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) is a phosphoprotein that plays important roles in the regulation of signal transduction and cell growth. In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 Ac) increases the basal activity of the HIV- 1 promoter and, especially, enhances the promoter's response to the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 12 -O-tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate (PMA). Additionally, ectopic PP 2 Ac enhances activation of HIV- 1 provirus by PMA. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP 2 A, markedly reduces both HIV- 1 enhancer and proviral activation. <b>Fostriecin,</b> a PP 2 A inhibitor which {{has been used as}} an antineoplastic agent in clinical trials, is also able to inhibit PMA-stimulated HIV- 1 proviral activation. These observations demonstrate a role for the important cellular phosphatase PP 2 A in HIV- 1 transcription and replication and also suggest that PKC can potentiate the activity of PP 2 A. PP 2 A is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in patients infected with HIV- 1...|$|E
40|$|Androgen {{receptor}} (AR) is phosphorylated {{at multiple}} sites {{in response to}} ligand binding, but the functional consequences and mechanisms regulating AR phosphorylation remain to be established. We observed initially that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the major PPP family serine/threonine phosphatases PP 2 A and protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1), had cell type-dependent effects on AR expression. More specific inhibitors of PP 2 A (<b>fostriecin)</b> and PP 1 (tautomycin and siRNA against the PP 1 α catalytic subunit) demonstrated that PP 1 and protein phosphatase 2 A had opposite effects on AR protein and transcriptional activity. PP 1 inhibition enhanced proteasome-mediated AR degradation, while PP 1 α overexpression increased AR expression and markedly enhanced AR transcriptional activity. Coprecipitation experiments demonstrated an AR-PP 1 interaction, while immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation showed androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of both AR and PP 1 in prostate cancer cells. Studies with phosphospecific AR antibodies showed that PP 1 inhibition dramatically increased phosphorylation of Ser- 650, a site in the AR hinge region shown to mediate nuclear export. Significantly, PP 1 inhibition caused a marked decrease in nuclear localization of the wild-type AR, but did not alter total or nuclear levels of a S 650 A mutant AR. These findings reveal a critical role of PP 1 in regulating AR protein stability and nuclear localization through dephosphorylation of Ser- 650. Moreover, AR may function as a PP 1 regulatory subunit and mediate PP 1 recruitment to chromatin, where it can modulate transcription and splicing...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the MID 1 protein {{have been}} found in {{patients}} with Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS), which is characterised by multiple malformations of the ventral midline. MID 1 is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and, in association with the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), a 4, provides ubiquitin ligase activity for the ubiquitin-specific modification of PP 2 A. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technology, we show here that MID 1 is actively and bi-directionally transported along the microtubules, and that this movement is directly linked to its MAP kinase and PP 2 A-mediated phosphorylation status. Intact transport depends on both kinesins and dyneins and is inhibited upon colcemide treatments. MID 1 proteins carrying missense mutations in the a 4 binding domain still bind the microtubules but cannot be actively transported. Likewise, knock-down of the a 4 protein, inhibition of PP 2 A activity by okadaic acid and <b>fostriecin</b> or the simulation of permanent phosphorylation at Ser 96 in MID 1 stop the migration of MID 1 -GFP, while preserving its microtubule-association. In summary, our data uncover an unexpected and novel function for PP 2 A, its regulatory subunit a 4 and PP 2 A/a 4 /mTOR signaling in the active transport of the MID 1 ubiquitin ligase complex along the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a failure in the microtubule directed transport of this protein complex would be a...|$|E
40|$|Cerebellar {{parallel}} fiber (PF) -Purkinje cell (PC) synapses can undergo postsynaptically expressed long-term depression (LTD) {{or long-term}} potentiation (LTP). PF-LTD induction requires the coactivity of the PF and CF (climbing fiber) inputs to PCs and a concomitant calcium transient and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). PF-LTP can be induced by PF activity alone and requires a lower calcium transient for its induction than PF-LTD. The cellular events triggering PF-LTP induction {{are not well}} characterized. At other types of synapses (e. g., in the hippocampus), bidirectional synaptic plasticity is under control of a kinase/phosphatase switch, with PKC and CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) activity promoting LTP induction and phosphatase activity promoting LTD induction. Here, we have tested for the involvement of protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1), PP 2 A, and PP 2 B (calcineurin) in cerebellar LTP induction using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat cerebellar slices. LTP induction was blocked {{in the presence of}} the PP 1 / 2 A inhibitors okadaic acid and microcystin LR, the PP 1 inhibitory peptide inhibitor- 2, the PP 2 A inhibitor <b>fostriecin,</b> and the PP 2 B inhibitor cyclosporin A. LTP induction was not impaired by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Conversely, LTD induction was not blocked by microcystin LR but instead was reduced when active PP 2 B was injected into PCs. These data indicate that a kinase/phosphatase switch controls bidirectional cerebellar plasticity, but in a manner "inverse" to the dependencies found at other types of synapses. Therefore, cerebellar LTP constitutes the only form of LTP described so far that depends on phosphatase rather than kinase activity...|$|E
40|$|Hyperphosphorylated tau {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies and is a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Though diverse kinases have been implicated in tau phosphorylation, protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) seems to be the major tau phosphatase. Using murine primary neurons from wild-type and human tau transgenic mice, we show that the antidiabetic drug metformin induces PP 2 A activity and reduces tau phosphorylation at PP 2 A-dependent epitopes in vitro and in vivo. This tau dephosphorylating potency can be blocked entirely by the PP 2 A inhibitors okadaic acid and <b>fostriecin,</b> confirming that PP 2 A is an important mediator of the observed effects. Surprisingly, metformin effects on PP 2 A activity and tau phosphorylation seem to be independent of AMPK activation, because in our experiments (i) metformin induces PP 2 A activity before and at lower levels than AMPK activity and (ii) the AMPK activator AICAR does not influence the phosphorylation of tau at the sites analyzed. Affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments together with PP 2 A activity assays indicate that metformin interferes with the association of the catalytic subunit of PP 2 A (PP 2 Ac) to the so-called MID 1 -alpha 4 protein complex, which regulates the degradation of PP 2 Ac and thereby influences PP 2 A activity. In summary, our data suggest a potential beneficial role of biguanides such as metformin in the prophylaxis and/or therapy of AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{antifungal}} phoslactomycins (PLM A-F), {{produced by}} Streptomyes sp HK 803, are structurally unusual in {{that three of}} their four double bonds are in the cis form (Δ 12, 13, Δ 14, 15, Δ 2, 3). The PLM polyketide synthase (PKS) has the predicted dehydratase catalytic domain in modules 1, 2 and 5 required for establishing two of these cis double bonds (Δ 12, 13 Δ 14, 15), {{as well as the}} only trans Δ 6, 7 double bond. By contrast, the formation of the cis Δ 2, 3 in the unsaturated lactone moiety of PLMs has presented an enigma because the predicted dehydratase domain in module 7 is absent. Herein, we have demonstrated that the plmT 2 gene product, with no homology to PKS dehydratase domains, is required for efficient formation of the cis Δ 2, 3 alkene. A series of new PLM products in which the C 3 hydroxyl group is retained, are made in plmT 2 deletion mutants. In all of these cases, however, the hydroxyl group is esterified with malonic acid. These malonylated PLM products are converted to the corresponding cis Δ 2, 3 PLM products and acetic acid by a facile base-catalyzed decarboxylative elimination reaction. Complete or partial restoration of natural PLM production in a plmT 2 deletion mutant can be accomplished by plasmid based expression of plmT 2 or fos ORF 4 (a homologous gene from the <b>fostriecin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster), respectively. The data indicate that dehydratase-independent pathways also function in establishment of unsaturated 6 -membered lactone moieties in other PKS pathways, and provide the first biosynthetic insights into the possible routes by which unusual malonylated polyketide products are generated...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of myosin {{phosphatase}} {{is critical}} for agonist-induced contractility of vascular smooth muscle. The protein CPI- 17 is a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor of myosin phosphatase and, in response to agonists, Thr- 38 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, producing a > 1, 000 -fold increase in inhibitory potency. Here, we addressed how CPI- 17 could selectively inhibit myosin phosphatase among other protein phosphatase- 1 (PP 1) holoenzymes. PP 1 in cell lysates was separated by sequential affinity chromatography into at least two fractions, one bound specifically to thiophospho-CPI- 17, and another bound specifically to inhibitor- 2. The MYPT 1 regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase was concentrated only in the fraction bound to thiophospho-CPI- 17. This binding was eliminated by addition of excess microcystin-LR to the lysate, showing that binding at the active site of PP 1 is required. Phospho-CPI- 17 failed to inhibit glycogen-bound PP 1 from skeletal muscle, composed primarily of PP 1 with the striated muscle glycogen-targeting subunit (GM) regulatory subunit. Phospho-CPI- 17 was dephosphorylated during assay of glycogen-bound PP 1, not MYPT 1 -associated PP 1, even though these two holoenzymes have the same PP 1 catalytic subunit. Phosphorylation of CPI- 17 in rabbit arteries was enhanced by calyculin A but not okadaic acid or <b>fostriecin,</b> consistent with PP 1 -mediated dephosphorylation. We propose that CPI- 17 binds at the PP 1 active site where it is dephosphorylated, but association of MYPT 1 with PP 1 C allosterically retards this hydrolysis, resulting in formation of a complex of MYPT 1 ·PP 1 C·P-CPI- 17, leading {{to an increase in}} smooth muscle contraction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Intradermal {{injection}} of capsaicin into the hind paw of rats induces spinal cord central sensititzation, {{a process in}} which the responsiveness of central nociceptive neurons is amplified. In central sensitization, many signal transduction pathways composed of several cascades of intracellular enzymes are involved. As the phosphorylation state of neuronal proteins is strictly controlled and balanced by the opposing activities of protein kinases and phosphatases, the involvement of phosphatases in these events needs to be investigated. This study is designed to determine the influence of serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2 A (PP 2 A) on the central nociceptive amplification process, which is induced by intradermal {{injection of}} capsaicin in rats. Results In experiment 1, the expression of PP 2 A protein in rat spinal cord at different time points following capsaicin or vehicle injection was examined using the Western blot method. In experiment 2, an inhibitor of PP 2 A (okadaic acid, 20 nM or <b>fostriecin,</b> 30 nM) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and the spontaneous exploratory activity of the rats before and after capsaicin injection was recorded with an automated photobeam activity system. The results showed that PP 2 A protein expression in the spinal cord was significantly upregulated following intradermal injection of capsaicin in rats. Capsaicin injection caused a significant decrease in exploratory activity of the rats. Thirty minutes after the injection, this decrease in activity had partly recovered. Infusion of a phosphatase inhibitor into the spinal cord intrathecal space enhanced the central sensitization induced by capsaicin by making the decrease in movement last longer. Conclusion These findings indicate that PP 2 A {{plays an important role in}} the cellular mechanisms of spinal cord central sensitization induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin in rats, which may have implications in clinical pain therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether the}} two ubiquitously expressed Ca 2 +-independent phosphatases PP 1 and PP 2 A regulate Ca 2 +-activated Cl− currents (ICl(Ca)) elicited by 500 nm [Ca 2 +]i in rabbit pulmonary artery (PA) myocytes dialyzed with or without 3 mm ATP. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments revealed the expression of PP 1 α, PP 1 β/δ, PP 1 γ, PP 2 Aα, PP 2 Aβ, PP 2 Bα (calcineurin (CaN) Aα), and PP 2 Bβ (CaN Aβ) but not PP 2 Bγ (CaN Aγ) in rabbit PA. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the presence of all three PP 1 isoforms and PP 2 A. Intracellular dialysis with a peptide inhibitor of calcineurin (CaN-AIP); the non-selective PP 1 /PP 2 A inhibitors okadaic acid (0. 5, 10, or 30 nm), calyculin A (10 nm), or cantharidin (100 nm); and the selective PP 1 inhibitor NIPP- 1 (100 pm) potently antagonized the recovery of ICl(Ca) in cells dialyzed with no ATP, whereas the PP 2 A-selective antagonist <b>fostriecin</b> (30 or 150 nm) was ineffective. The combined application of okadaic acid (10 nm) and CaN-autoinhibitory peptide (50 μm) did not potentiate the response of ICl(Ca) in 0 ATP produced by maximally inhibiting CaN or PP 1 /PP 2 A alone. Consistent with the non-additive effects of either classes of phosphatases, the PP 1 inhibitor NIPP- 1 (100 pm) antagonized the recovery of ICl(Ca) induced by exogenous CaN Aα (0. 5 μm). These results demonstrate that ICl(Ca) in PA myocytes is regulated by CaN and PP 1 and/or PP 2 A. Our data also suggest the existence of a functional link between these two classes of phosphatases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAdenosine {{signaling}} via A 1 receptor (A 1 R) and A 2 A receptor (A 2 AR) {{has shown}} promise in revealing potential targets for neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia. We recently showed a novel {{mechanism by which}} A 1 R activation with N 6 -cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) induced GluA 1 and GluA 2 AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis and adenosine-induced persistent synaptic depression (APSD) in rat hippocampus. This study further investigates the mechanism of A 1 R-mediated AMPAR internalization and hippocampal slice neuronal damage through activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1), 2 A (PP 2 A), and 2 B (PP 2 B) using electrophysiological, biochemical and imaging techniques. Following prolonged A 1 R activation, GluA 2 internalization was selectively blocked by PP 2 A inhibitors (okadaic acid and <b>fostriecin),</b> whereas inhibitors of PP 2 A, PP 1 (tautomycetin), and PP 2 B (FK 506) all prevented GluA 1 internalization. Additionally, GluA 1 phosphorylation at Ser 831 and Ser 845 was reduced after prolonged A 1 R activation in hippocampal slices. PP 2 A inhibitors nullified A 1 R-mediated downregulation of pSer 845 -GluA 1, while PP 1 and PP 2 B inhibitors prevented pSer 831 -GluA 1 downregulation. Each protein phosphatase inhibitor also blunted CPA-induced synaptic depression and APSD. We then tested whether A 1 R-mediated changes in AMPAR trafficking and APSD contribute to hypoxia-induced neuronal injury. Hypoxia (20  min) induced A 1 R-mediated internalization of both AMPAR subunits, and subsequent normoxic reperfusion (45  min) increased GluA 1 but persistently reduced GluA 2 surface expression. Neuronal damage after hypoxia-reperfusion injury was significantly blunted by pre-incubation with the above protein phosphatase inhibitors. Together, {{these data suggest that}} A 1 R-mediated protein phosphatase activation causes persistent synaptic depression by downregulating GluA 2 -containing AMPARs; this previously undefined role of A 1 R stimulation in hippocampal neuronal damage represents a novel therapeutic target in cerebral ischemic damage...|$|E
