40|$|IntroductionPrior {{studies have}} shown varied rates of medical {{pathology}} in patients presenting to acute care settings with psychotic symptoms, and {{there is almost no}} literature from the sub-Saharan Africa region. We investigated the yield of physical examination and laboratory testing among patients presenting with acute psychosis to an urban ED in Dar es Salaam. MethodsThis was a prospective observational study of patients presenting to the ED at Muhimbili National Hospital with acute psychosis. A standardized data form was used to prospectively collect demographics, history, physical examination, and diagnostic test results. Data were entered into Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and analysed with SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). ResultsWe enrolled 252 participants from August to October 2012, mean age 32 (± 11) years, and 69 % male. Overall, 161 (64 %) had a history of psychiatric illness and 137 (54 %) were on psychiatric medication. Comorbidities included dementia (6), HIV (5), recent trauma (5), diabetes (2), CVA (1), and other chronic medical conditions (21). The most common physical examination findings were skin abnormalities (11 % of patients), including infections, bruises, cuts, lacerations and rashes. Of patients undergoing laboratory investigations, 39 / 206 (19 %) had abnormal lab findings and 27 / 39 (69 %) were clinically significant, including positive HIV tests (9), abnormal blood chemistries (7), positive malaria tests (5), abnormal <b>full</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> (4), and abnormal blood glucose levels (3). ConclusionsIn our cohort, history and physical examination findings were not sufficient to rule out serious medical conditions among patients presenting with acute psychosis. The observed rate of laboratory abnormalities was higher than previously published rates from high-resource settings. Based on our findings, patients presenting with psychosis to an acute care facility in this region should be evaluated with physical examination and laboratory studies to rule out serious underlying medical pathology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} of pulmonary tuberculosis {{in patients with}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) {{is complicated by the}} increased presence of sputum smear negative tuberculosis. Diagnosis of smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis is made by an algorithm recommended by the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme that uses symptoms, signs and laboratory results. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the sensitivity and specificity of the tuberculosis treatment algorithm used for the {{diagnosis of}} sputum smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods A cross-section study with prospective enrollment of patients was conducted in Dar-es-Salaam Tanzania. For patients with sputum smear negative, sputum was sent for culture. All consenting recruited patients were counseled and tested for HIV. Patients were evaluated using the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme guidelines and those fulfilling the criteria of having active pulmonary tuberculosis were started on anti tuberculosis therapy. Remaining patients were provided appropriate therapy. A chest X-ray, mantoux test, and <b>Full</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>Picture</b> were done for each patient. The sensitivity and specificity of the recommended algorithm was calculated. Predictors of sputum culture positive were determined using multivariate analysis. Results During the study, 467 subjects were enrolled. Of those, 318 (68. 1 %) were HIV positive, 127 (27. 2 %) had sputum culture positive for Mycobacteria Tuberculosis, of whom 66 (51. 9 %) were correctly treated with anti-Tuberculosis drugs and 61 (48. 1 %) were missed and did not get anti-Tuberculosis drugs. Of the 286 subjects with sputum culture negative, 107 (37. 4 %) were incorrectly treated with anti-Tuberculosis drugs. The diagnostic algorithm for smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis had a sensitivity and specificity of 38. 1 % and 74. 5 % respectively. The presence of a dry cough, a high respiratory rate, a low eosinophil count, a mixed type of anaemia and presence of a cavity were found to be predictive of smear negative but culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Conclusion The current practices of establishing pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis are not sensitive and specific enough to establish the diagnosis of Acid Fast Bacilli smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis and over treat people with no pulmonary tuberculosis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{bleeding}} disorders (NBD) {{are common}} causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} at the neonatal unit, Muhimbili medical centre, Dar Es Salaam. However, no study has yet been done to determine the magnitude or the associated risk factors. Therefore a descriptive cross-sectional and case control study was carried out from January 22 nd to April 25 th, 1998 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with NBD. During this period a total of 1628 newborn infants were admitted to the neonatal ward and out of ~ these 589 babies ~ recruited into the study. One hundred seventy five infants (29. 9 %) with bleeding disorders were recruited as cases and 414 (70. 2 %) without evidence of bleeding as controls. Only infants where parental consent was obtained were included into the study. For each infant a thorough history was taken, physical examination done and a <b>full</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> together with coagulation profile determined. Twin babies were 18 (10. 3 %) of the study cases as compared to 46 (11. 1 %) in the controls. Singleton babies were 157 (89. 7 %) of the cases and 368 (88. 9 %) of the controls. The difference in bleeding status between twin and singleton infants was found not to be statistically significant (X 2 = 0. 09, P = 0. 76). Seventy nine (45. 1 %) of the study cases and 148 (35. 7 %) of the control cases were born with Low Birth Weight (LBW). The difference was statistically significant (X 2 = 4. 58, P = 0. 03). Furthermore 54 (30. 9 %) of the study cases and 95 (22. 9 %) of the controls were born prematurely and the' difference was statistically significant (X 2 = 4. 07, P = 0. 04). One hundred and eight (61. 7 %) of the cases and 199 (48. 1 %) of the controls were asphyxiated and the difference was highly significant (X 2 = 9. 18, P = 0. 002). In 27 (31. 4 %) of the cases and 121 (54. 8 %) of the III controls, the mother was given general anaesthesia during delivery. The difference was highly significant (X 2 = 13. 53, P = 0. 0002). The APGAR score was less than 7 in 86 (49. 1 %) of the cases and 124 (30 %) of the controls. The difference was highly significant (X 2 = 20. 43 p = 0. 00003). Fifty six (32 %) of the study group and 166 (40. 1 %) of the controls cases were delivered by a mode other than Spontaneous Vertex Delivery (SVD) and the difference was also highly significant (X 2 = 30. 97, p = 0. 0000008). The Prothrombin Time (PT) was prolonged in 5 (2. 9 %) of the cases and 13 (3. 4 %) of the controls, but the difference was not statistically significant (X 2 = 0. 56, P = 0. 7). The Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) was also prolonged in 14 (8. 1 %) of the cases and 33 (8. 8 %) of the controls. However, the difference was also not statistically significant (X 2 = 1. 52, P = 0. 46). The proportion of infants with vitamin-K deficiency (crude prevalence) as judged by abnormal PT and APTT in the study population ranged between 2. 9 % to 8. 8 %, but the majority of them did not have any obvious bleeding clinically. The prevalence ofNBD was found to be 10. 7 % and that vitamin-K deficiency related bleeding was not a significant problem at the neonatal unit. However, large scale studies are needed to confirm this finding. Asphyxia neonatorum, LBW, mode of delivery other than SVD and general anaesthesia were the only risk factors significantly associated with bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Background Significant {{challenges}} {{exist in}} the diagnosis of neonatal septicaemia due to the non specific nature of clinical presentation as well as problems in laboratory confirmation of suspected cases. In most deprived countries often diagnosis is {{made on the basis}} of clinical suspicion and antibiotics are prescribed empirically. Objective To determine prevalence of neonatal sepsis, spectrum of etiological agents and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern and evaluate the efficacy of Rubarth’s newborn of sepsis and C- reactive protein in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis using blood culture as a gold standard. Methodology: This was a hospital based prospective cross sectional study conducted at the neonatal ward of the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam city from March 2012 to April 2013. Participants were neonates who had clinical features suggestive of neonatal sepsis by WHO criteria. Babies were physically examined and investigations which included; a bloodfor culture and sensitivity, <b>full</b> <b>blood</b> <b>picture</b> andtwo serial measurements of C – reactive protein (CRP), taken 12 hours apart were collected. Rubarth’s newborn scale of sepsis which is based on combining physical findings and FBP results, was used for scoring sepsis. The efficacy of Rubarth’s newborn scale of sepsis and serial CRP was assesses by calculating sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values as well as likelihood ratios (LHR). Blood culture was used as a gold standard and if the confidence did not include 1 and p value of < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 208 neonateswere recruited out of whom 40 (19. 2 %) blood culture had a positive blood culture. The isolated organisms were Klebsiella species (35 %), Coagulase Negative viii Staphylococus (30 %), Staphylococcus aureus (10 %), Escherichiacoli (22. 5 %), and Pseudomonas species (2. 5 %). The overall resistance to the WHO recommended first line antibiotics was for cloxacillin 100 %, ampicillin 96. 4 % and gentamicin 39 % while for second line drug ceftriaxone was 41 %. Resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was 53. 6 % and 13. 9 % respectively. Clinical features that were significantly associated with neonatal sepsis were fever (67. 3 %), fast breathing (79. 8 %),and low muscle tone (38. 9 %) and this was statistically significant withp< 0. 001. The first CRPhadsensitivity of 87. 5 % and specificity of 70. 8 %, the likelihood ratio for positive test was 3, while LHR for negative tests 0. 18 both with a p value of < 0. 001. Combined CRP had sensitivity of 97. 4 % and specificity of 53. 7 %. Rubarth’sneonatal score of sepsis had sensitivity of 65 % and specificity of 79. 7 % serial CRP had sensitivity of 97. 4 %. Combining CRP and neonatal scale of sepsis reduced sensitivity to 94. 71 %as compared to when CRP was used alone. Conclusion: Serial CRP has a high sensitivity of 97. 4 % to diagnose neonatal sepsis. The etiological agents to neonatal sepsiswereidentified to be Klebsiellaspp, CoNS, S. aureus,E. coli, and Pseudomonas spp. These agents were found to be sensitive to amikacin and resistant to the currently prescribed first line antibiotics and moderate resistant to the second line drugs whose use can be guided by sensitivity results. Recommendation:In the management of suspected neonatal sepsis, serial CRP done twelve hours apart in combination with Rubarth’s Neonatal scale of sepsis can be used for screening of neonatal sepsis. Once the results for the screening tests are available a blood sample for culture can be taken for those neonates with a positive test. There is also a room for follow up studies on usefulness of CRP in combination with RNSOS in monitoring for response to treatment. Because of high resistance observed, there is a need to have follow up studies to assess the efficacy of the current first line antibiotics used in the management of neonatal sepsis...|$|E
