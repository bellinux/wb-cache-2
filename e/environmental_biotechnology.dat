50|$|Rittmann {{and several}} colleagues {{were the first}} to define soluble {{microbial}} products (SMP), which comprise a wide range of soluble organic molecules that microorganisms release to their environment. With Dr. Chrysi Laspidou, Rittmann linked SMP to the solid-phase products generated by microorganisms, the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS); they created the “unified model” of SMP, EPS, and active biomass, and it has been expanded and applied to all types of microbiological processes. Being major sinks for electrons and carbon, SMP and EPS have profound impacts on the performance of <b>environmental</b> <b>biotechnologies</b> in terms of effluent quality and the composition of the biomass.|$|R

To be eligible, a candidate must: - Already be engaged in research in biotechnology - Upon termination of the fellowship, must return to his or her country of residence to put the know ledge acquired to beneficial use in local research and training programmes; - Provide evidence that the theoretical and practical knowledge or training acquired at the host laboratory will be beneficial to the candidate`s on-going research programme. Applications submitted must be accompanied by a letter of recommendation from someone familiar with the candidate's work and a letter of acceptance from the host institute. All applications must be made on a UNESCO/BAG application form to be received by 30 June or 30 December of the calendar year.

50|$|Humans {{have been}} {{manipulating}} genetic material for centuries. Although many benefits {{are provided by}} these manipulations, there can also be unexpected, negative health and environmental outcomes. <b>Environmental</b> <b>biotechnology,</b> then, {{is all about the}} balance between the applications that provide for these and the implications of manipulating genetic material. Textbooks address both the applications and implications. Environmental engineering texts addressing sewage treatment and biological principles are often now considered to be <b>environmental</b> <b>biotechnology</b> texts. These generally address the applications of biotechnologies, whereas the implications of these technologies are less often addressed; usually in books concerned with potential impacts and even catastrophic events.|$|E

40|$|This study {{relates to}} water {{purification}} and thus <b>environmental</b> <b>biotechnologies,</b> but also possibly to other applications of decantation and sedimentation of particulate solids {{in the presence}} of biomacromolecules. Activated sludge settling characteristics are of paramount importance both for design and performances of activated sludge water treatment plants and we developed a device to observe this phenomenon. Using our device, our dynamic measurements of activated sludge decantation in the near infrared region (940 nm) presented apparent aberrations. For example, light transmission in the sample transitorily exceeded 100 % of the transmission of pure water under certain conditions. Arguments are provided to interpret these results by a modification of the solvent (H 2 O) properties, especially concerning some vibrational modes of water molecules. This assumption warrants a meticulous validation involving spectrometric analysis in the visible and near infrared region. © 2012 IM Publications LLP All rights reserved.
