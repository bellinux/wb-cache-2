50|$|Condensation of aminopyrazole (1) with {{diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate}} (2) gives {{the product of}} the addition-elimination (3). The product tautomerizes spontaneously to the hydroxypyridine (4). The {{hydroxyl}} group is then converted to the chloro-derivative by means of phosphorus oxychloride (5). Displacement of halogen by n-butylamine gives the antidepressant compound cartazolate. Displacement of halogen by the basic nitrogen of acetone hydrazone affords the antidepressant <b>etazolate.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The role of PDE- 4 {{inhibitor}} <b>etazolate,</b> {{was evaluated}} {{in the presence}} of PDE- 7 inhibitor, BRL- 50481, in animal models of epilepsy. Seizures were induced in the animals by subjecting them to injection of chemical convulsants, Pilocarpine, Kainic acid (KA) and maximal electroshock (MES). The combination of <b>etazolate</b> and BRL 50481 treated mice showed a significant (P< 0. 001) quick onset of action, jerky movements and convulsion when compared to gabapentin. The combination of <b>etazolate</b> and sGC inhibitor, methylene blue (MB) treated mice showed a significant (P< 0. 001) delay in onset of action, jerky movements and convulsion when compare to gabapentin as well as against the combination of <b>etazolate</b> with BRL 50481. The present study mainly highlights the individual effects of <b>etazolate</b> and combination with BRL- 50481 potentiates (P< 0. 001) the onset of seizure activity against all models of convulsion. The study mainly comprises the onset of seizures, mortality/recovery, percentage of prevention of seizures (anticonvulsant) and total duration of convulsive time. The total convulsive time was prolonged significantly (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01) in combination of methylene blue with <b>etazolate</b> treated (28. 59 % and 35. 15 %) groups, compared to DMSO received group (100 %) in the MES model. In the same way, the combination of calcium channel modulator (CCM) and calcium channel blocker (CCB) amiodarone and nifedipine respectively, with <b>etazolate</b> showed a significant (P< 0. 001) delay in onset of seizures, compared to DMSO and <b>etazolate</b> treated groups in all models of epilepsy. This confirms that both CCM and CCB possess anticonvulsant activity. Finally, the study reveals that identification of new cAMP mediated phosphodiesterases family members offers a potential new therapy for epilepsy management in future...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: EHT 0202 (<b>etazolate</b> hydrochloride) {{is a new}} {{compound}} exhibiting both potential disease-modifying and {{symptomatic treatment}} properties in Alzheimer's Disease increasing alpha-secretase activity and sAPP alpha secretion, as well as acting as a GABA-A receptor modulator and as a PDE- 4 inhibitor. METHODS: This pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre, Phase IIA {{study was conducted in}} 159 randomized patients suffering from mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. EHT 0202 (40 or 80 mg bid) or placebo was administered as adjunctive therapy to one acetylcholinesterase inhibitor over a 3 -month period. This study was designed to assess the clinical safety and tolerability of EHT 0202 as a primary objective, with secondary endpoints (cognitive function, daily living activities, behaviour, caregiver burden and global functioning) included to explore clinical efficacy of EHT 0202 versus placebo. RESULTS: EHT 0202 was shown to be safe and generally well tolerated. Dose-dependent numbers of early withdrawal and central nervous system related adverse events were observed. As expected, since the study was not powered and not designed to show drug efficacy, and except for ratings on the ADCS-ADL scale, no significant differences were seen between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: These first encouraging safety results do support further development of EHT 0202 in order to assess its clinical efficacy and to confirm its tolerability in a larger cohort of Alzheimer patients and for a longer period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Theophylline {{has been}} used widely as a {{bronchodilator}} {{for the treatment of}} bronchial asthma and has been suggested to modulate immune response. While the importance of macrophages in asthma has been reappraised and emphasized, their significance has not been well investigated. We conducted a genome-wide profiling of the gene expressions of macrophages in response to theophylline. Methods Microarray technology was used to profile the gene expression patterns of macrophages modulated by theophylline. Northern blot and real-time quantitative RT-PCR were also used to validate the microarray data, while Western blot and ELISA were used to measure the levels of IL- 13 and LTC 4. Results We identified dozens of genes in macrophages that were dose-dependently down- or up-regulated by theophylline. These included genes related to inflammation, cytokines, signaling transduction, cell adhesion and motility, cell cycle regulators, and metabolism. We observed that IL- 13, a central mediator of airway inflammation, was dramatically suppressed by theophylline. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA analyses also confirmed these results, without respect to PMA-treated THP- 1 cells or isolated human alveolar macrophages. Theophylline, rolipram, <b>etazolate,</b> db-cAMP and forskolin suppressed both IL- 13 mRNA expression (~ 25 %, 2. 73 %, 8. 12 %, 5. 28 %, and 18. 41 %, respectively) and protein secretion (Conclusion Our results suggest that the suppression of IL- 13 by theophylline may be through cAMP mediation and may decrease LTC 4 production. This study supports the role of theophylline as a signal regulator of inflammation, and that down regulation of IL- 13 by theophylline may have beneficial effects in inflammatory airway diseases. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes human {{sleeping sickness}} and Nagana in domestic animals and {{depends on the}} tsetse fly for dissemination. The complex T. brucei life cycle requires differentiation from the dividing long slender forms via the cell cycle arrested short stumpy forms (both in the mammalian bloodstream) to the procyclic forms of the insect vector. The signaling pathways that regulate differentiation are unknown but there is evidence for an involvement of cAMP. In search of the putative cAMP receptor, three catalytic and one regulatory PKA-like subunits have been previously cloned from T. brucei. The catalytic subunits possess all features of a classical PKA in terms of inhibitor and substrate specificity. It was shown {{that each of the}} catalytic PKAlike subunits binds to the regulatory subunit to form a dimeric PKA-like holoenzyme. Most surprisingly, we found that T. brucei PKA-like kinase, despite of its apparent similarities to a PKA, was not activated but instead inhibited by cAMP. Out of several other cyclic nucleotides that were tested on their effects on PKA-like kinase, only cGMP was able to activate the kinase, but in millimolar and thus most likely unphysiological concentrations. Assuming that the activation of PKA-like kinase might depend on its native, subcellular environment, an in vivo kinase assay was established in this work. It is based on the immunological detection of the phosphorylated form of the PKA reporter substrate VASP that was transgenically expressed in T. brucei. Interestingly, results from the in vivo assay did confirm the in vitro data, suggesting that T. brucei PKA-like kinase is in fact inhibited rather than activated by cAMP. Even though these findings challenge the original assumption that T. brucei PKA-like kinase transmits the differentation signal mimicked by cAMP antagonists, data from this work nevertheless provide evidence for an involvement of T. brucei PKA-like kinase in relaying extracellular cues. This is suggested from an increase in in vivo PKA activity in the presence of treatments that have either been shown to induce LS to SS differentiation (<b>etazolate)</b> or to participate in SS to PCF differentiation (cold shock, mild acid stress). In addition, in vivo PKA activity was stimulated with the PDE inhibitor dipyridamole and at hypoosmotic stress. In the context of a putative role for T. brucei PKA-like kinase in the regulation of differentiation, two of the catalytic isoforms (PKAC 1 and PKAC 2) were of particular interest. We found significant life cycle stage dependent differences in protein expression between the two almost identical isoforms. PKAC 1 was nearly exclusively present in bloodstream forms and PKAC 2 in procyclic cells. In addition, PKAC 1, but not PKAC 2 carries a phosphorylation that is restricted to the SS stage. This phosphorylation was mapped to the C-terminal threonine 324 by mass spectrometry. The functions of these life cycle stage dependent differences between PKAC 1 and PKAC 2 remain unknown. Reverse genetics did not reveal any functional differences between the isoforms, in fact, PKAC 1 was even able to complement PKAC 2 in procyclic PKAC 2 knock-out cells. Results from several reverse genetic experiments indicate that T. brucei PKA-like kinase {{plays an important role in}} cell division. Depletion of either PKA-like subunit leads to a cytokinesis block. Depletion of the regulatory PKA-like subunit additionally results in altered basal body segregation. Given that 1) both cytokinesis and basal body movement had been previously suggested to be regulated by the trypanosomal flagellum (Kohl et al., 2003) and 2) the flagellum hosts T. brucei PKA-like kinase (C. Krumbholz, this lab) we propose that trypanosomal flagella act as signaling compartments for coordination of cell division...|$|E
