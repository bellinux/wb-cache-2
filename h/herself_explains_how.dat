50|$|Voigt <b>herself</b> <b>explained</b> <b>how</b> her {{dramatic}} {{weight loss}} affected her breathing and breath support:Much of what I did with my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a different body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|R

The Goodies had mistakenly foiled an attempt to put the real Crown Jewels back. Fortunately, they are let off the hook for their noble actions and are requested to treat the embarrassing incident as a secret. Still in business and safe from jail, the Goodies rejoice.|$|R

Regardless of the situation, Sandy confesses that she can't truly go home, but can't bring <b>herself</b> to <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> her home is truly [...] "broken." [...] At Puff's urging, she confesses that she makes up her lies because she doesn't want to live with her perceived truth that she considers herself responsible for her parents' divorce. At that statement, the natives chortle with delight at what Puff explains is a self-deceptive lie and makes her realize that she {{had nothing to do with}} her parents' break-up and they still love her.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens with}} Tomoki {{and the rest}} of the New World Discovery Club in the middle of another unusual, if not typical, situation. A giant chicken, about whom Tomoki {{apparently}} forgot, wreaks havoc on Sorami City, so Tomoki, via one of Ikaros' cards, has Sohara grown to giant size to fight the chicken, which she defeats, but then promptly steps on Tomoki for staring up her skirt. The film then switches to Daedalus who explains more about the Angeloids and their history, and then to a scene where an Angel is asleep in a pod. On Earth, Hiyori Kazane, a resident of Sorami City and the film's main heroine, introduces <b>herself</b> and <b>explains</b> <b>how</b> she met and fell in love with Tomoki, while also narrating about how she took part in several events from the two previous anime seasons, all the while observing Tomoki and his friends, and even becoming acquainted with most of them.|$|R

The night on which Mr Asterias spots his mermaid, Scythrop returns to his tower only to find a mysterious young woman there. She calls <b>herself</b> Stella and <b>explains</b> <b>how</b> {{she is one of the}} seven people who read his {{treatise}}. Fleeing from some [...] "atrocious persecution", she had no friend to turn to until she read Scythrop's treatise and realised that here was a kindred mind who would surely not fail to assist her in her time of need. Scythrop secretes her in his hidden chamber. After several days he finds that his heart is torn between the flirtatious Marionetta and the intellectual Stella, the one worldly and sparkling, the other spiritual and mysterious. Unable to choose between them, Scythrop decides to enjoy both, but is terrified of what might happen should either of his loves learn of the other's existence.|$|R
40|$|Focuses on {{the study}} of the role of former slaves in the Cuban War of Independence, in light of the {{avoidance}} of the theme of race within this war in Cuban historiography. Author discusses reasons for the silence on race issues, and for the historic construction of the "myth" of racial equality in this era. Then, she points at the difficulties in the studying of the presence of former slaves among the Cuban soldiers in the War of Independence, due to the absence of racial labels for the registered soldiers. She describes how the research on the theme became more local, and focused on the Cienfuegos region, in part because of Cienfuegos' extensive local archive. Then, she outlines the different approaches to research on the matter by the archives' director Orlando García Martínez, by Michael Zeuske, and by the author <b>herself.</b> The latter <b>explains</b> <b>how</b> she extended her archival research with oral testimonies of descendants in Cienfuegos of black soldiers, and how through examining life histories, collective biographies, and genealogies, she ascertained that the number of former slaves in the rebellious Cuban army was relatively small, but the number of free-born blacks and mulattoes was high...|$|R

Regardless of the events, Chanel (Emma Roberts) explains that Black Friday is her favorite holiday, where she buys forgettable, cheap presents for her friends and good ones for <b>herself.</b> She also <b>explains</b> <b>how</b> every year she bribes the store's worker to open the store earlier for her so she can buy all the things from the sale and leave only one in the display, thus leaving {{the people who have been}} waiting for the store to open angry and devastated, all just for her joy. She is about to go to the mall when Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) stops her and the other Chanels. They insist on going though, and after a heated speech by Chanel explaining why she loves the holiday so much and pointing out how there's nothing they can currently do about the situation, Dean Munsch desists.|$|R
