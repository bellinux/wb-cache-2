These two units were later delinked in 1938 as the Militia was expanded following increased political tensions in Europe. In March 1942, during the Second World War, the 12th Light Horse was converted to a motor regiment, known as the 12th Motor Regiment. In September 1942, it was redesignated the 12th Armoured Car Regiment, and assigned to the 3rd Armoured Division.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year <b>of</b> life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

He dismissed the top-scorer John Lill for 176 and his other victims were Michael Clingly and Peter Trethewey. This allowed Victoria to take first innings points and eventually complete a six-wicket win. This meant that all of Harvey's five wickets as first-class level came against South Australia. Harvey's first-class career ended with the following match against New South Wales. He made 1 and 9, and conceded 26 runs from three wicketless overs, and was dropped, having made only 133 runs at 16.62 for the season.|$|E

In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel.

The gameplay was also more focused on the characters, as opposed to the combat, to allow players to relate to them more. The gameplay sequences were designed to contrast with other moments of Ellie's life; for example, the water gun fight with Riley is contrasted to the gunfights with enemies.
