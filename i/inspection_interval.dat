5000|$|A cascade chart is {{tool that}} can be used in damage {{tolerance}} analysis to determine the proper <b>inspection</b> <b>interval,</b> based on reliability analysis, considering all the context uncertainties. The chart is called a [...] "cascade chart" [...] because the scatter of data points and downward curvature resembles a waterfall or cascade. This name was first introduced by Dr. Alberto W Mello in his work [...] "Reliability prediction for structures under cyclic loads and recurring inspections". Materials subject to cyclic loads, as shown in the graph on the right, may form and propagate cracks over time due to fatigue. Therefore, it is essential to determine a reliable <b>inspection</b> <b>interval.</b> There are numerous factors that must be considered to determine this <b>inspection</b> <b>interval.</b> The Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) technique must have a high probability of detecting a crack in the material. If missed, a crack may lead the structure to a catastrophic failure before the next inspection. On the other hand, the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> cannot be too frequent that the structure's maintenance is no longer profitable.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of detection distribution curve for a chosen NDI method is superimposed to the crack growth curve, and the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> is systematically changed to compute the cumulative {{probability of}} detection for a crack growing from the minimum to the critical size. The simulation is repeated several times, and a distribution of <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> versus structural reliability can be formed. To refine the randomization of the values, the Latin Hypercube procedure was also introduced.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{variables}} that {{play a role}} in the selection of the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> using the cascade chart. These variables are the probability of detection over the lifetime of the structure and the confidence level for the stated probability. As one of the graph's axes is probability, it is fairly easy to find the data points that match a specific probability. In aerospace structural analysis, it is common to consider 99.9999% probability (0.0001% risk) to be improbable and 99.99999% probability (0.00001% risk) to be extremely improbable. Then, the confidence interval is used to select a point where a specified percentage of the data points lies to the right of the selected point. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that 95% of the simulated cases must fall to the right of this point. This specific point is marked, and the respective point on the x-axis represents the suggested <b>inspection</b> <b>interval.</b> Furthermore, to derive the estimated risk per flight hour, the risk percentage can be divided by the number of flight hours described in the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval.</b> Hopefully, using this process, the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> will lead to a higher percentage of cracks being detected before failure, ensuring greater flight safety. A final important observation is that improving the NDI method can increase the number of flight hours needed before re-inspection while maintaining a relatively low risk level.|$|E

The results of this research effort indicate that implementation of state-of-the-art reliability-based assessment procedures can contribute very valuable procedures for assigning inspection protocols (i. e. <b>inspection</b> <b>intervals)</b> that are based upon probabilities of finding fatigue-induced cracking in these structures.

50|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that a 'worst-case {{exposure}} scenario' can be limited to {{a specific set of}} conditions. Based on the advanced detection methods and pipeline shut-off SOP developed by TransCanada, the risk of a substantive or large release over {{a short period of time}} contaminating groundwater with benzene is unlikely. Detection, shutoff, and remediation procedures would limit the dissolution and transport of benzene. Therefore, the exposure of benzene would be limited to leaks that are below the limit of detection and go unnoticed for extended periods of time. Leak detection is monitored through a SCADA system that assesses pressure and volume flow every 5 seconds. A pinhole leak that releases small quantities that cannot be detected by the SCADA system (<1.5% flow) could accumulate into a substantive spill. Detection of pinhole leaks would come from a visual or olfactory inspection, aerial surveying, or mass-balance inconsistencies. It is assumed that pinhole leaks are discovered within the 14-day <b>inspection</b> <b>interval,</b> however snow cover and location (e.g. remote, deep) could delay detection. Benzene typically makes up 0.1 - 1.0% of oil and will have varying degrees of volatility and dissolution based on environmental factors.|$|E

If protective devices do not work well, serious consequences may be resulted. It is critical to {{pay special attention to}} their maintenance. For this reason, many availability models have been developed to obtain an optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> and to maximize their availability. However, few attention have been paid to the relationship between the statistical distributions used to describe the lifetime of protective devices and their optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> and maximum availability. Furthermore, the problem that might occur when the normal distribution takes negative values has not been considered yet in protective device maintenance. This thesis aims to calculate the optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> and maximum availability for the Weibull, normal, truncated normal and exponential distributions. Also, the relationship between these statistical distributions, and the availability and the <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> is studied. Finally, this thesis intends to study the problem that arises when the normal distribution might take negative values. To meet these objectives, an existing availability model, which considers constant time between inspections, is adapted to the Weibull, normal, truncated and exponential distributions. After adapting the model to each distribution, the effects of each distribution’s parameters on the optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>interval</b> and maximum availability are analyzed.

Probabilistic safety {{assessment}} {{is regarded as the}} most widespread methodology for studying the safety of nuclear power plants. As maintenance {{is one of the most}} important factors for affecting the reliability and safety, an enhanced preventive maintenance optimization model based on a three-stage failure process is proposed. Preventive maintenance is still a dominant maintenance policy due to its easy implementation. In order to correspond to the three-color scheme commonly used in practice, the lifetime of system before failure is divided into three stages, namely, normal, minor defective, and severe defective stages.

The model is designed to support through-life service {{in the form of}} multiple nested inspections and maintenance to meet defined asset availability and capability requirements, as well as achieving successful through-life tech-nology insertions. The inspections and maintenance activities are assumed to be performed at more than one level, but nested and aimed at different types of defects or subsystems over a fixed period of time (the designed asset life). This practice is common in many industries, particularly in the defense industry. The impact of technological insertions is reflected through changes in the failure behavior of the asset. We use the delay time concept to model the failure mechanism of the asset, and the arrivals of defects are assumed to follow Poisson processes. The decision variables are the <b>inspection</b> <b>intervals,</b> while the objective function can be expressed in terms of cost, downtime, or reliability.
