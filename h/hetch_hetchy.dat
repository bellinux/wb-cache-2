5|$|Roosevelt's successor, Woodrow Wilson, {{signed the}} Raker Act into law on December 13, 1913, which {{authorized}} {{construction of the}} dam. <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Reservoir grew as the valley was flooded behind the O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923. The Raker Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake, both located northwest of <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> in the park.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> supply {{is some of the}} cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{hotly contested}} status of O'Shaughnessy Dam in the {{environmental}} field, and occasional federal money set aside for studying alternatives to <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> – such as $7 million provided by President George W. Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems would have to be in place by 2025 and <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Reservoir would have to be drained by 2035.|$|E

5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants to shut down. The fire also threatened the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to within a mile of <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{fourteen}} potential water sources {{considered by the}} city – which included Lake Tahoe, the Eel River, and tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers– <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> was considered superior for its excellent dam site, abundant sediment-free water, lower cost and hydroelectric potential. At the time, <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> was an isolated, seldom visited subalpine valley, visited intermittently by gold seekers and sheepherders. However, since 1890, <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley and the surrounding lands {{had been part of}} Yosemite National Park and thus off-limits to utility development, let alone at the grand scale proposed by the city. Even though the valley was not well known to the general public, organizations such as the Sierra Club treasured it for its spectacular beauty, often compared to that of Yosemite Valley itself. Led by naturalist and mountaineer John Muir, the Sierra Club adamantly opposed the city of San Francisco as it sought permission from the federal government to build a dam in the valley.|$|E
5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for water and power is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> {{represented}} {{the first great}} environmental controversy in the US, and debate over the dam and reservoir continues today. Preservationist {{groups such as the}} Sierra Club lobby for the restoration of the valley, while others argue that leaving the dam in place would be the better economic and environmental decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, a dam in the {{northern}} portion of the park was proposed. Located in the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley, its purpose was to provide water and hydroelectric power to San Francisco. Muir and the Sierra Club opposed the project, while others, including Gifford Pinchot, supported it. In 1913, the U.S. Congress authorized the O'Shaughnessy Dam through passage of the Raker Act.|$|E
5|$|The park can {{be divided}} into 5 {{sections}} for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy,</b> and Crane Flat/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, and free information is available from the Park Service in Yosemite. Park rangers encourage visitors to experience portions of the park in addition to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the {{disastrous}} earthquake and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy.</b> There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in the crowded Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of April 18, 1906, a large {{earthquake}} with an epicenter {{near the city of}} San Francisco hit the region. Immediate casualty estimates by the U.S. Army's relief operations were 498 deaths in San Francisco, 64 deaths in Santa Rosa, and 102 in or near San Jose, for a total of about 700. More recent studies estimate the total death count to be over 3,000, with over 28,000 buildings destroyed. Rebuilding efforts began immediately. Amadeo Peter Giannini, owner of the Bank of Italy (now known as the Bank of America), had managed to retrieve the money from his bank's vaults before fires broke out through the city and was the only bank with liquid funds readily available and was instrumental in loaning out funds for rebuilding efforts. Congress immediately approved plans for a reservoir in <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley in Yosemite National Park, a plan they had denied a few years earlier, which now provides drinking water for 2.4 million people in the Bay Area. By 1915, the city had been sufficiently rebuilt and advertised itself to the world during the Panama Pacific Exposition that year, although the effects of the quake hastened the loss of the region's dominant status in California to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} array of plants and animals. Gray pine, incense-cedar, and California black oak grow in abundance. Many {{examples}} of red-barked manzanita can be seen along the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Road. Spring and early summer bring wildflowers including lupine, wallflower, monkey flower, and buttercup. Seventeen species of bats inhabit the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> area, including the largest North American bat, the western mastiff.|$|E
25|$|Compared with Yosemite Valley, {{the walls}} of <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> are {{smoother}} and rounder because it was glaciated to a greater extent. This is because the Tuolumne catchment basin above <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> is almost three times {{as large as the}} catchment area of the Merced River above Yosemite, allowing a greater volume of ice to form.|$|E
25|$|The bill to dam <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> passed Congress in 1913, {{and so the}} Sierra Club {{lost its}} first major battle. In retaliation, the Club {{supported}} creation of the National Park Service in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. Stephen Mather, a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> dam, became the first National Park Service director.|$|E

25|$|Preservation groups {{including}} the Sierra Club and Restore <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> state that draining <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> {{would open the}} valley back up to recreation, a right that should be provided to the American people because the reservoir is within the legal boundaries of a national park. They acknowledge that a concerted effort {{would have to be}} made to control the introduction of wildlife and tourism back into the valley in order to prevent destabilization of the ecosystem, and that it might be decades or even centuries before the valley could be returned to natural conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> is {{the name}} of a valley, a {{reservoir}} and a water system in California in the United States. The glacial <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley lies in the northwestern part of Yosemite National Park and is drained by the Tuolumne River. For thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the 1850s, the valley was inhabited by Native Americans who practiced subsistence hunting-gathering. During the late 19th century, the valley was renowned for its natural beauty – often compared to that of Yosemite Valley – but also targeted for the development of water supply for irrigation and municipal interests.|$|E
25|$|Interest {{in using}} the valley as a water source or {{reservoir}} dates {{back as far as}} the 1850s, when the Tuolumne Valley Water Company proposed developing water storage there for irrigation. By the 1880s, San Francisco was looking to <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> water as a fix for its outdated and unreliable water system. The city would try repeatedly to acquire water rights to <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy,</b> including in 1901, 1903 and 1905, but was continually rebuffed because of conflicts with irrigation districts that had senior water rights on the Tuolumne River, and because of the valley's national park status.|$|E
25|$|At Muir's urging, Lukens became {{actively}} involved in several Sierra Club campaigns: to purchase privately held toll roads for public use into Yosemite National Park, and to protect <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley in Yosemite.|$|E
25|$|Pinchot was {{generally}} opposed to preservation {{for the sake}} of wilderness or scenery, a fact perhaps best illustrated by the important support he offered to the damming of <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley in Yosemite National Park.|$|E
25|$|Water from <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> {{is some of}} {{the cleanest}} {{municipal}} water in the United States; San Francisco is one of six U.S. cities not required by law to filter its tap water, although the water is disinfected by ozonation and, since 2011, exposure to UV. The water quality is high because of the unique geology of the upper Tuolumne River drainage basin, which consists mostly of bare granite; as a result, the rivers feeding <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Reservoir have extremely low loads of sediments and nutrients. The watershed is also strictly protected, so swimming and boating are prohibited at the reservoir (although fishing is permitted at the reservoir and in the rivers which feed it).|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club {{immediately}} opposed {{efforts to}} reduce Yosemite National Park by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings. At one meeting {{in the fall of}} 1895 that included Muir, Joseph LeConte, and William R. Dudley, the Sierra Club discussed the idea of establishing 'national forest reservations', which were later called National Forests. The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906. The fight to preserve <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight. Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Dam.|$|E
25|$|People {{have lived}} in <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley for over 6,000 years. Native American {{cultures}} were prominent before the 1850s when the first Euro-Americans arrived in the Sierra Nevada. During summer, people of the Miwok and Paiute came to <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> from the Central Valley {{in the west and}} the Great Basin in the east, respectively. The valley provided an escape from the summer heat of the lowlands. They hunted, and gathered seeds and edible plants to furnish themselves winter food, trade items, and materials for art and ceremonial objects. Today, descendants of these people still use milkweed, deergrass, bracken fern, willow, and other plants for a variety of uses including baskets, medicines, and string.|$|E
25|$|While its cousin Yosemite Valley to {{the south}} had {{permanent}} Miwok settlements, <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> was only seasonally inhabited. This was likely because of Hetch Hetchy's narrow outlet, which in years of heavy snowmelt created a bottleneck in the Tuolumne River and the subsequent flooding of the valley floor.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Aqueduct, which {{supplies}} 270 to 315 {{million gallons}} of water per day to the City of San Francisco and other Bay Area communities, directly crosses the Hayward Fault in Fremont. A 2002 report by the Bay Area Economic Forum suggests that a breakdown in the aqueduct due to an earthquake could cut off <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> water to the Bay Area for 60 days. In addition to depriving 85% of San Francisco residents of their drinking water, this would cut off supplies for firefighting and water-intensive industry, causing economic damage of $17.2–28.7 billion. Extensive reconstruction work at the Hayward Fault crossing includes a multi-sectioned tunnel structure to allow shear without collapse, this is to contain a section of water pipe with ball joints and a slip joint.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, {{the city}} of San Francisco {{proposed}} building a hydroelectric dam to flood <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> Valley. The city and the Sierra Club argued over the dam for 10 years, until the U.S. Congress passed the Raker Act in 1913 and allowed dam building to proceed. O'Shaughnessy Dam was completed in 1923.|$|E
25|$|The Heisler {{locomotive}} {{that would}} eventually become Pickering Lumber #2 {{was one of the}} first locomotives purchased when San Francisco began buying for the HHRR in 1917. Built in 1918, it may have worked tender to tender with <b>Hetch</b> <b>Hetchy</b> #4. In 1923 #2 was sold to Standard Lumber Company which became Pickering Lumber.|$|E
