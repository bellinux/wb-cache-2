50|$|Chest {{radiography}} is {{the preferred}} means of initial diagnosis for hemothorax. Upright radiography is preferred but supine films may be taken when upright radiography is not feasible due to the clinical situation. Tube thoracostomy may be done prior to imaging when patients have sustained blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma and display unstable hemodynamics, have respiratory failure with absent or decreased breath sounds, show tracheal deviation, or have serious penetrating injuries. In upright radiography, hemothorax is suggested by blunting of the costophrenic angle or partial or complete opacification of the hemithorax, in which the lateral side of the chest appears bright and the lung appears pushed away toward the center; the air-filled lung normally appears as a dark space on radiographic film. In {{the case of a}} small hemothorax, several hundred milliliters of blood can be hidden by the diaphragm and abdominal viscera. In supine patients, signs of hemothorax may also be subtle on radiographic film, because the blood will layer in the pleural space, and {{can be seen as a}} haziness in one <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax</b> relative to the other side.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} early trilobites, Fallotaspis has an almost flat exoskeleton, {{that is only}} thinly calcified, and has {{crescent-shaped}} eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, Fallotaspis lacks dorsal sutures. As part of the superfamily Fallotaspidoidea Fallotaspis can be distinguished from Olenelloidea, Judomioidea and Nevadioidea by features of the cephalon {{and in particular the}} glabella. The glabella tapers forward. The frontal lobe of the glabella (because it is counted from the back, it is numbered L4) is as long as the most backward lobe (L0), less than in these other Olenellina subfamilies. The eye ridges (or ocular lobes) contact, but do not merge with, the entire frontal margin of the glabella. The cephalon of Fallotaspis is semi-circular in shape, with rounded cheeks that are continuous with long spines that go back to the first <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax.</b> Sutures absent. The thorax has up to 21 segments. The third segment terminating in a long spine that extends back to the fourteenth segment. The tail shield (or pygidium) is very small, about the same length as the two most backward thorax segments combined.|$|R
40|$|Summary. -The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} of recipient mouse lung on tumour colony growth after intravenous injection of C 3 H mammary adenocarcinoma cells or aggregates was tested in C 3 H male mice irradiated with 14 MeV electrons {{to the whole}} or <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax.</b> Injections were made 3 h, 48 h, 3 j months or 9 - months after irradiation. The number and size of colonies were increased in irradiated areas of the lung at 48 h and at 3 j months after doses of 2000 rad. However, 91 months after irradiation lungs {{were found to be}} atrophied and fibrotic and enumeration ot tumour colonies was found to be impossible. An increase in colony growth after 250 rad was seen only at 91 months after irradiation. SEVERAL clinical reports have noted that post-operative radiotherapy may be associated with higher incidences of bloodborne metastases (Bond, 1968; Fisher et al. 1971; Paterson and Russell, 1959). Experimental work has shown that local irradiation of lung tissue enhances the clonogenic growth of both allogeneic and syngeneic tumour cells after intravenous injection...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-24 mm. The {{head and}} front <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax</b> are dark ashy grey. The hind {{part of the}} thorax is much lighter towards the abdomen, which is ashy grey above and lighter beneath. A fine whitish longitudinal line occurs {{on each side of}} the head, over the eyes. The forewings have a dark-brown stripe running along the costa, which widens outwardly to include the whole of the first lobe, which is more or less sprinkled with white scales, especially on the middle of the wing and at the base and near the end of the first lobe, the two latter forming two more or less defined oblique white stripes, the outer one of which is much more oblique and narrower than the one above the end of the fissure. The hind half of the wing is much lighter, with a somewhat indistinct brown spot on the middle of the cell and another just within the end of the cleft. The fringes are brownish, with a sub-basal darker line. The hindwings and fringes greyish brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 95 - 100 mm. It {{is similar}} to Xylophanes aristor and Xylophanes rhodochlora. The forewings are relatively short and broad, with an almost straight outer margin. The anterior <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax</b> upperside is separated from the remainder by a fine white line. The tegula are edged in grey along the inner margin. There is also a median line of grey scales. The upperside of the abdomen has a broad, grey dorsal stripe and the lateral stripe is vivid yellow. The forewing upperside {{is similar to}} Xylophanes rhodochlora, but the ground colour is bronzy green with pearly reflections, the discal spot is smaller and the first and fourth postmedian lines are darker green, highlighted along their inner edges in pearly grey. The fringe is orange. The marginal area of the forewing underside is of the same general brick-red colour {{as the rest of}} the wing, barely delineated by a grey line. Females are identical to males, but the antennae are thinner and the forewing is broader and more rounded.|$|R
40|$|Rab 11, an {{evolutionary}} conserved, ubiquitously expressed subfamily of small monomeric GTPase {{has been known}} to regulate diverse cellular and developmental events, by regulating the exocytotic and transcytotic events inside the cell. Our studies show that Rab 11 regulates Drosophila adult myogenesis by controlling proliferation and differentiation of the Adult muscle precursors (AMPs). Blocking Rab 11 in the AMPs, which fuse to form the Indirect Flight Muscles (IFMs) of fly, renders flies completely flightless and non-viable. The indirect flight musculature, comprising of the differentially patterned dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) and dorsal ventral muscles (DVMs), is affected to different extents. Abrogating or knocking down normal Rab 11 function results in severely disrupted IFMs. DLMs forming from larval templates are reduced in number along with a significant reduction in their fibre size. The de novo developing DVMs are frequently absent. The DLMs in Rab 11 hypomorphs are highly reduced, showing as a small constricted mass in one <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax.</b> Further, Rab 11 function is essential for growth of these muscles during later half of adult myogenesis, as down regulation of Rab 11 in IFMs results in degenerated muscles and broken fibres. Finally, we show that loss of Rab 11 activity in the AMPs result in acquisition of migratory characteristic of myoblast as they show cellular protrusion at their polar ends accompanied with loss of cell-cell contacts. Our data provide the first evidence of a trafficking protein playing an indispensable role in regulating early stages of adult muscle development...|$|R
40|$|The incarceration of {{diaphragmatic hernia}} is very rare. We present {{a case of}} a {{four-year}} old girl who developed the incarceration of left-sided diaphragmatic hernia, who, until then, was completely asymptomatic. This incarceration of the hernia represented a surgical emergency presenting as obstructive ileus and a severe respiratory distress which developed from what appeared to be full health. During a brief pre-operative examination a number of differential diagnoses were suggested. Along with the laboratory blood analysis (complete blood count and acid-base balance) a plain thoracic and abdominal radiography was done (babygram). After that, through an inserted nasal-gastric tube, barium meal of the upper gastrointestinal tract was done, showing abdominal organs in the left <b>half</b> of the <b>thorax</b> and a signifi cant shift of the mediastinum to the right. With an urgent upper medial laparotomy we accessed the abdominal cavity and made the correct diagnosis. An opening was shown in the rear part of the left hemi-diaphragm with thickened and edematous edges, approx. 6 cm in diameter with incarcerated content. The incarcerated abdominal organs (stomach, transversal colon, small intestine and spleen) gradually moved into the abdominal cavity. The opening was closed with nonresorptive sutures (TiCron) size 2 - 0 with a previous control and ventilated expansion of the well-developed left lung. In postoperative course the acid-base balance quickly recovered, as well as the general state of the patient and radiography showed a good expansion and lucency of the lung parenchyma and a return of the mediastinum into the middle part of the thorax...|$|R
