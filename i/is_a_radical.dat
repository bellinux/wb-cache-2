25|$|The {{treatment}} of the myth of Prometheus in Prometheus Bound <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> departure from the earlier accounts found in Hesiod's Theogony (511-616) and Works and Days (42-105). Hesiod essentially portrays the Titan as a lowly trickster and semi-comic foil to Zeus's authority. Zeus's anger toward Prometheus is in turn responsible for mortal man's having to provide for himself; before, all of man's needs had been provided by the gods. Prometheus' theft of fire also prompts {{the arrival of the}} first woman, Pandora, and her jar of evils. Pandora is entirely absent from Prometheus Bound, and Prometheus becomes a human benefactor and divine king-maker, rather than an object of blame for human suffering.|$|E
25|$|Musically, Death Magnetic <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> {{departure}} from Metallica's previous album, St. Anger (2003), which featured simple instrumentation, downtuned guitars, stripped-down production, and {{an absence of}} guitar solos. This album, on the other hand, features more complex musical compositions and long, technical guitar solos from both Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield, and standard guitar tuning in most songs, marking {{a return to the}} band's thrash metal roots. The album received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics describing it as a return to the musical style of their early albums. Despite its praise, there was much criticism aimed at the album's production, which featured an overly compressed dynamic range that caused some songs to feature poor sound quality.|$|E

500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>radical</b> {{departure}} from West's previous hip hop albums. According to 33⅓ writer Kirk Walker Graves, 808s & Heartbreak is an avant-garde electropop album. Rolling Stone magazine {{called it an}} [...] "introspective, synthpop album," [...] while The 405 described it as West's [...] "experimental pop record." [...] According to The Independent, West abandoned his customary hip hop sound in favor of sparse, drum machine-based electropop. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef also categorized the album as [...] "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record", but added that it is [...] "steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau called it a [...] "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" [...] and analyzed that West's choice to [...] "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame {{that might otherwise be}} pure pity parties". Christgau asserted that its final track [...] "Pinocchio Story" [...] is [...] "the only track here about what's really bringing [...] down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." [...] Andre Grant of HipHopDX wrote that [...] "to combat this trenchant melancholia, he poured himself into an all-autotunes R album" [...] which would prove divisive in hip hop. West's singing has been characterized as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "nearly unmelodic" [...] which [...] "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." [...] Canadian writer Stephen Marche viewed that West used [...] "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, a program designed to eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album." ...|$|E
