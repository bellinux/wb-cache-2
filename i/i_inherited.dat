5|$|Albert <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> {{the throne}} {{after the death}} of Leopold II in 1909. His rule ended with his death in 1934, {{encompassing}} the final half-decade of the long 19th century and continuing through the First World War and into the Interbellum. The period 1909 to 1913 was marked by continued economic confidence, and two World's fair were hosted in Belgium in 1910 and in 1913.|$|E
5|$|My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords {{for this}} {{dramatic}} last-minute but not opportunistic maiden speech. Although <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> my title 30 {{years ago and}} have attended spasmodically, particularly during the early 1970s when we rigorously debated the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Community Bill of Accession, both in Committee and on Report until extremely late at night, my heart has not entirely been in the thrust and cut of politics, unlike my more distinguished ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The tittle (dot) on {{the letter}} {{i of the}} Latin {{alphabet}} originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish i from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It {{first appeared in the}} 11th century in the sequence ii (as in ingeníí), then spread to i adjacent to m, n, u, and finally to all lowercase is. The j, originally a variant of <b>i,</b> <b>inherited</b> the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we have today.|$|E

25|$|Charles <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> a {{settlement}} in Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking the political judgement of his father, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the 'plainness' of the Scottish service he, together with his Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the Prayer Book of 1637, a slightly {{modified version of the}} Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Although this was devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, Charles' insistence that it be drawn up in secret and adopted sight-unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh in mid-1637 it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with Jenny Geddes, spread across Scotland. In early 1638 the National Covenant was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting at the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been tested and approved by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful, but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles' attempt at resistance to these developments led to the outbreak of the Bishops' Wars. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots Covenanters at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians—resulting in the Westminster Confession of Faith being agreed by both. This document remains the subordinate standard of the Church of Scotland, but was replaced in England after the Restoration.|$|E
500|$|The former {{president}} {{was quoted in}} 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, [...] "Had {{it not been for}} the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed." [...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E

"We {{have already}} ended {{a number of}} sponsorships that <b>I</b> <b>inherited...</b> but we have chosen to {{continue}} the sponsorship of Newcastle United and Newcastle Falcons, partly because of commitments we have entered into there – sometimes sponsorships continue until they come to a contractual end – and partly because I believe {{it is in the}} commercial interest of the bank that we should continue with both of these." ...|$|E

Martin adored her father. [...] "He was tall, good-looking, silver-haired, with the kindest brown eyes. Mother was the disciplinarian, but it was Daddy who could turn me into an angel with just one look." [...] (p.19) Martin, who said [...] "I’d never understand the law" [...] (p.19), began singing outside the courtroom where her father worked every Saturday night at a bandstand. She sang in a trio with her sister and Marion Swofford, dressed in bellhop uniforms. [...] "Even in those days without microphones, my high piping voice carried all over the square.

2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} psychoneurosis. From him <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lighthouse {{design was}} the family's profession: Thomas's father (Robert's grandfather) was the famous civil {{engineer}} Robert Stevenson, {{and both of}} Thomas's brothers (Robert's uncles) Alan and David, {{were in the same}} field. Indeed, even Thomas's maternal grandfather, Thomas Smith, had been in the same profession. However, Robert's mother's family were not of the same profession. Margaret's natal family, the Balfours, were gentry, tracing their lineage back to a certain Alexander Balfour who had held the lands of Inchyra in Fife in the fifteenth century. Margaret's father, Lewis Balfour (1777–1860), was a minister of the Church of Scotland at nearby Colinton, and her siblings included the physician George William Balfour and the marine engineer James Balfour. Stevenson spent the greater part of his boyhood holidays in his maternal grandfather's house. [...] "Now I often wonder," [...] wrote Stevenson, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> from this old minister. I must suppose, indeed, that he was fond of preaching sermons, and so am I, though I never heard it maintained that either of us loved to hear them." ...|$|E

2500|$|.....I was {{interested}} in how free culture and open-source licensing strategies could help improve access and participation in the creative content <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> from my ancestors in just that age {{when it was all}} transitioning from an analog print format to a searchable digital one. To me it seemed both obvious and necessary to pursue the digitization of existing works in the public domain, and broaden the network of students, scholars, practitioners, and communities that were already adopting, adapting, and distributing their inspired creativity and scholarship -- but were only doing so in the highly restricted channel of copyrighted work....The essential problem is how to keep a collaborative project like Judaism culturally vital, in an age when the creative work of participants in the project -- prayers, translations, commentaries, songs, etc. -- are immediately restricted from creative reuse by [...] "All Rights Reserved" [...] copyright. The fact is that broad creative engagement in collaborative projects isn't only limited by technological forces: these can be and have been overcome.

2500|$|Alexios <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> an army {{which had}} been {{painstakingly}} reconstituted through the administrative efforts of the able eunuch Nikephoritzes. This army, though small due {{to the loss of}} territory and revenue, was in its nature similar to that of earlier Byzantine armies back as far as Nikephoros Phokas and beyond; indeed some units could trace their history back to Late Roman times. This rather traditional Byzantine army was destroyed by the Italo-Normans at Dyrrhakhion in 1081. In the aftermath of this disaster Alexios laid the foundations of a new military structure. He raised troops entirely by ad hoc means: raising the regiment of the archontopouloi from the sons of dead soldiers and even pressing heretic Paulicians from Philippopolis into the ranks. Most important is the prominent place in this new army of Alexios' extended family and their many connections, each aristocrat bringing to the field his armed retinue and retainers. Before campaigning against the Pechenegs in 1090 he is recorded as summoning [...] "his kinsmen by birth or marriage and all the nobles enrolled in the army." [...] From pure necessity an army based on a model derived ultimately from Classical Antiquity was transformed, like the empire as a whole, into a type of family business. At this point the army could be characterised as being a feudal host with a substantial mercenary element.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{liberal in}} its content, the Constitution created a {{centralized}} government, where the provinces had no true autonomy. Desire for local control sparked a minor rebellion in some provinces {{in the northeast}} in 1824 which was easily suppressed, but the incident was enough to reveal discontent with the State's organization. At the end of 1825, a secessionist rebellion began in Cisplatina, the southernmost Brazilian province. Unlike {{the rest of the}} nation, its population consisted of both Luso-American and Hispano-American elements, a result of colonial times when sovereignty over the region shifted between Portugal and Spain. The United Provinces of South America (a former Spanish colony later known as Argentina) formally annexed the Brazilian province. The Empire responded with a declaration of war, which [...] "was to draw Brazil into a long, inglorious, and ultimately futile war in the south" [...] – the Cisplatine War. João VI died in March 1826, {{a few months after the}} outbreak, and Pedro <b>I</b> <b>inherited</b> the Portuguese crown, becoming King Pedro IV. Brazil and Portugal were again reunited—though only in a personal union—barely 2 years following the end of the war for Brazilian independence. Pedro I quickly abdicated the Portuguese crown in favor of his eldest daughter Maria II, but as she was a minor, he retained involvement in Portuguese affairs.|$|E
