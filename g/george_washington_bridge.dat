5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans {{at the time}} were to build a new {{alignment}} from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where it would turn southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side of Manhattan, there were a myriad of Hudson River ferries at one point, with boat routes running from New Jersey to twenty {{passenger}} docks in Manhattan. However, the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, and <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge</b> between Manhattan and New Jersey, as well as the growth of car ownership in the United States, meant that these ferries were no longer needed by the mid-20th century. As a result, in 1967, the last cross-Hudson ferry (between Hoboken and Battery Park City) ceased operations.|$|E

5|$|The plan resurfaced in 1929, when {{meetings}} {{took place}} between Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague and officials from New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker's office. This plan proposed a subway line running along the SIRT North Shore Branch and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in New Jersey, before connecting with the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (today's PATH train) at Exchange Place. The service would have provided access to Lower Manhattan via the H's Downtown Hudson Tubes to Hudson Terminal (now {{the site of the}} World Trade Center station). There were also plans to extend the line to the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge</b> in Fort Lee.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{implemented}} a discount on regular toll fees during off-peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State.

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 1/9 were removed, while Route 25T became US 1/9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1/9 Business (now Route 139). In 1964, the US 1/9 {{approaches to the}} <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge,</b> which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side, were rebuilt into a freeway that {{became a part of}} I-95. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township, which was the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1/9 was a part of Route 25, was replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E
5|$|Route 4 was {{originally}} legislated in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering {{to run from}} Cape May north to the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge,</b> running through Pleasantville, Toms River, Freehold, Perth Amboy, Rahway, and Paterson. The route replaced portions of the alignments of several pre-1927 state highways including pre-1927 Route 14 between Cape May and Seaville, pre-1927 Route 19 between Seaville and Absecon, pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and between South Amboy and Rahway, a spur of pre-1927 Route 7 between Lakewood and Freehold. The rest of the proposed route was to be built on a new alignment. Of the pre-1927 state highways that Route 4 was to follow, pre-1927 Route 14 {{was originally}} legislated in 1917, pre-1927 Route 19 was legislated in 1923 but never built, pre-1927 Route 4 was created in 1916, and the spur of pre-1927 Route 7 was created in 1925. U.S. Route 9 was also designated along Route 4 between Absecon and Lakewood and from South Amboy to Rahway. By the 1940s, U.S. Route 9 was realigned to follow Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy, having followed portions of today’s Route 88, Route 35, and Route 71 and was extended south along Route 4 to Cape May. The section of present-day Route 4 was built between 1930 and 1934 to connect Paterson and the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge</b> in Fort Lee. There were plans made in 1936 to make this portion of Route 4 a limited-access road; however, World War II delayed plans for the expressway.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski Skyway {{ends at the}} Tonnele Circle with US 1/9 Truck and Route 139, and US 1/9 {{continue}} north along at-grade Tonnelle Avenue toward North Bergen, {{where the}} road intersects Route 3 and Route 495. Crossing into Bergen County, Broad Avenue carries US 1/9 through Fairview and Ridgefield before heading into Palisades Park. Here, the two routes join US 46, and the combined road heads north into Fort Lee. US 1/9/46 come to an interchange with I-95, US 9W, and Route 4, where it joins I-95 to head east to the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge</b> over the Hudson River. At this point, US 46 ends and I-95 and US 1/9 continue into Manhattan, New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E

5|$|The current US 46 {{was marked}} in 1936 between Portland, Pennsylvania and the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge.</b> At the time, the new Route 6 {{had not been}} {{completed}} from Route 2 (now Route 17) west to Route S6 (now Route 62), and so US 46 was marked through Paterson until this portion was completed by the 1940s. At {{the west end of}} Route 6, US 46 continued over the Delaware River on the Delaware Bridge into Pennsylvania, replacing Pennsylvania Route 987 north to Portland, where it ended at US 611. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its associated freeway to Columbia (now I-80) opened in December 1953, as did the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The current {{alignment}} of US 1 between Trenton and New Brunswick was chartered as the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike in 1803 and struggled throughout its 100-year existence. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway across the United States was created and connected Trenton to Newark within New Jersey. The Lincoln Highway was legislated as Route 13 between Trenton and New Brunswick in 1917 {{and as part}} of Route 1 between New Brunswick and Elizabeth, later extended to Jersey City. With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, US 1 was designated to follow the Lincoln Highway between Trenton and Newark and the current {{alignment of}} US 1/9 Truck to Jersey City, where it continued to the Holland Tunnel. In 1927, the Lincoln Highway portion of US 1 became Route 27. The current alignment of US 1 between Trenton and Newark was legislated as Route 26, Route S26 and Route 25, while the current route north from Jersey City to the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge</b> became Route 1 and Route 6. In subsequent years, US 1 was moved onto its current routing between Trenton and the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge.</b> The state highways running concurrent with US 1 were removed in 1953, around the same time the route was moved to the Trenton Freeway within Trenton and the old alignment became US 1 Alternate, part of which is now US 1 Business. By 1969, the Trenton Freeway was extended north to Whitehead Road in Lawrence Township, and that segment became Route 174. When the Trenton Freeway was completed north to US 1, the US 1 designation was shifted to the freeway, replacing Route 174.|$|E
5|$|US 46 {{continues}} southeast as a four-lane freeway, {{with the}} US1-9 ramps following the route {{a short distance}} before merging into the route. At this point, US1-9 become concurrent with US 46 and the freeway makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast. The road has an interchange to the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US1-9/ US46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas via RIRO before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes with RIRO access, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US1-9/ US46 all join I-95 (although US46 is unsigned east of this interchange) and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings. The road has an interchange with Route 67 at GWB Plaza {{before coming to the}} eastbound toll plaza for the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Past the toll plaza, there is an interchange for the Palisades Interstate Parkway. After the Palisades Interstate Parkway, the road crosses the Hudson River on the <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>Bridge,</b> which has eight lanes total on the upper deck (formed from the express lanes) and six lanes total on the lower deck (formed from the local lanes). At the New Jersey/New York border on the bridge, US46 ends while I-95 and US1-9 continue into the borough of Manhattan in New York City on the Trans-Manhattan Expressway.|$|E
