Amongst those arrested was Thomas Maguire, a young Royal Marine on leave, who unfortunately for him had been {{in the vicinity of the}} attack on the police van and was Irish. Such was the zeal of the police that one man with a strong Irish accent surrendered himself to the magistrates [...] "as the only means <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>of</b> saving myself from being arrested over and over again wherever I go, as a Fenian".|$|E
500|$|According to Barry Miles, Lennon resented McCartney's {{direction}} of the band as well as how, aside from [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", he himself was now supplying [...] "songs to order" [...] rather than [...] "writing from the heart" [...] as he had on Revolver. Everett describes Starr as having been [...] "largely bored" [...] during the sessions, with the drummer later lamenting: [...] "The biggest memory <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>of</b> Sgt. Pepper... is I learned to play chess". Speaking in 2000, Harrison said he {{had little interest in}} McCartney's concept of a fictitious group and that, after his experiences in India, [...] "my heart was still out there … I was losing interest in being 'fab' at that point." [...] Harrison added that, having enjoyed recording Rubber Soul and Revolver, he disliked how the group's approach on Sgt. Pepper became [...] "an assembly process" [...] whereby, [...] "A lot of the time it ended up with just Paul playing the piano and Ringo keeping the tempo, and we weren't allowed to play as a band as much." ...|$|E

500|$|Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror {{believed}} the [...] "setting and the gangsterish plot are both reminiscent of that great British movie Sexy Beast, and this first instalment of the four-part series presses {{all the right}} buttons," [...] adding [...] "it has naturalistic performances, an effortless blend of comedy and sinister undertones plus rather more shots of Marc Warren's bum cheeks than might be considered absolutely necessary." [...] Ben Walsh of The Independent rated the series three stars out of five, having written [...] "there's far too much exposition, a very daft plot, some risible dialogue and yet Sky's ripe four-parter is horribly compelling," [...] and added [...] "it's extremely silly, but Simm and Glenister are always compelling and they make this gamey tale of gangsters, police corruption and 'friendship' work." [...] Reviewing the first two episode, The Stage {{believed the}} first was [...] "a slow-burning exploration" [...] and [...] "all very intriguing and disturbing, with a great performance by Chaplin as the smilingly psychotic host." [...] The reviewer criticised the death of Alvo, as he was considered the most [...] "compelling character" [...] and since [...] "sent the plot line spinning off into less original territory," [...] adding the producers took ideas from crime capers such as Sexy Beast and Shallow Grave. The reviewer added [...] "what Mad Dogs lacks in originality it makes up for in energy, verve and humour. The dialogue positively crackles with great lines." [...] In the end, the reviewer stated that Mad Dogs [...] "may be an unapologetic crowd pleaser, {{but it is a}} finely made one, with excellent performances from a dream cast. It also offers the only opportunity <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>of</b> seeing blue skies, azure waters and sunshine in February, so I am in for the duration." ...|$|E

He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She [...] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>of</b> course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E

2500|$|Michelle Burnham adopts {{the nineteenth}} century {{theories}} that Shakespeare's sonnets contain autobiographical information about him, in order to explore the novel Ulysses. [...] Through her examination into Joyce's use of the poems, the reader can discover the mindset of {{the nineteenth century}} Shakespeare reader. [...] Burnham affirms that critics of the past believed that Shakespeare was caught in a love triangle between a fair boy and dark woman in her article, [...] "'Dark Lady and Fair Man': The Love Triangle in Shakespeare's Sonnet and Ulysses". [...] Stephen Booth reinforces this argument by stating that in line 7 [...] "my saint" [...] "is [...] in the courtly love tradition, in which poets customarily spoke about their beloveds in the manner and language of... worshipers to, or about, saints". [...] Harvey Stanborough claims that Shakespeare's Sonnet 144 discusses not a bisexual relationship between the author and [...] "a man right fair" [...] and [...] "a woman coloured ill", but rather it reveals Shakespeare's internal conflict as an artist. [...] He proposes [...] "that it was actually addressed to a much broader, general audience and is an attempted explanation of his own artistic mind". [...] To him, the two loves in the sonnet embody two passions which pull at Shakespeare's mind in opposing directions: [...] "the speaker is explaining that he has two passions: a passion (desire) for comfort, and a passion (need) for despair". He uses a less edited version of the sonnet to assert that the first line of the poem makes a clear distinction between passions rather than lovers. [...] He uses [...] "Two loves <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>of</b> Comfort and Despaire" [...] to show that the separation of the comma [...] "contend that the two loves he mentions are not people at all, but the two sides--light and dark--of his creative personality".|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>of</b> that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
