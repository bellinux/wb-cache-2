5|$|After hearing this, Jule convinces the {{reluctant}} Jan {{to break into}} Hardenberg's home in the affluent Berlin suburb of Zehlendorf while he is away on business. During the break-in, {{the thrill of the}} moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house's floodlights, and they quickly leave.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa excitedly {{discuss their}} visit to Kamp Krusty, {{a summer camp}} run by Krusty the Clown. Homer has made Bart's visit {{conditional}} on him getting at least a C- average on his report card. Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel, so he changes each grade into straight A+. Homer chides Bart for not faking plausible grades, but lets him go to camp anyway, because <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> Bart hanging around throughout the summer.|$|E
50|$|On January 15, 2013, a {{memorial}} {{was held for}} Howser, who said before his death that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> a funeral as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> attention.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Ursula vaguely. After all, the {{tiresome}} thing was, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> an odalisk, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> a slave. Hermione {{would have}} been his slave--there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself before a man--a man who worshipped her, however, and admitted her as the supreme thing. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> an odalisk. <b>He</b> wanted a woman to TAKE something from him, to give herself up {{so much that she}} could take the last realities of him, the last facts, the last physical facts, physical and unbearable.|$|R
60|$|He went {{straight}} to Shortlands. There he found Gerald standing {{with his back to}} the fire, in the library, as motionless as a man is, who is completely and emptily restless, utterly hollow. <b>He</b> had <b>done</b> all the work he wanted to do--and now there was nothing. He could go out in the car, he could run to town. But <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go out in the car, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to run to town, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to call on the Thirlbys. He was suspended motionless, in an agony of inertia, like a machine that is without power.|$|R
5|$|Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), {{trying to}} explain to her that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to hurt her. However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on turning it into her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{encourages}} her elderly neighbor Roy (Orson Bean) {{to propose}} {{to his girlfriend}} Karen (Kathryn Joosten), and he does so after Karen indicates {{she wants to get}} married. Later, however, Roy laments to Susan about being put in the situation, and fears he will start lusting after other women now that he is engaged. Later, Karen learns she may have lung cancer. Roy tells Susan he is marrying Karen because he now realizes <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to lose Karen, and is sure she will beat the cancer.|$|E

He assures her that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> her to fail, and they kiss.|$|E
50|$|Buckwild - 20 Pack {{eliminated}} Buckwild {{in order}} to appease Tailor Mades majority alliance (who were sick of Buckwild and her antics) and secure a pass for the next elimination. While <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to separate Buckwild and Saaphyri, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to eliminate Angelique after she had saved him from elimination in a previous episode.|$|R
60|$|And then {{he confessed}} further, because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to seem merely sentimentally hopeful.|$|R
60|$|But Dschemil {{turned and}} went into the house, for <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to quarrel.|$|R
5|$|The next day, an {{argument}} erupts between Santosh and Subramaniam {{during which the}} former becomes emotional and shouts that he has lost so many small things in life because of Subramaniam. But he preferred to stay calm as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to hurt his father.

Since <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{the babies}} to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him.

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, {{such as in the}} Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team is {{alerted to}} an {{incident}} at a quarantine site, where the amber encasing {{the site has}} been cut into and a body has been removed. They identify the missing body as Joshua Rose, a former bank robber. Joshua had previously caught Fringe Division's attention as he used a molecular destabilization device to break into banks, triggering quarantine-level events. Colonel Broyles is privately cautioned by Walternate that those trapped in amber are still alive, a fact <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be made public for fear of their outcry. Broyles relays this to his team, requesting they find Rose and bring him in as quickly as possible.|$|E

He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.|$|E

Monica’s first serious relationship is with long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is twenty-one years her senior. The couple maintains a strong relationship for some time, until Richard expresses that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have children, much to Monica’s dismay. Monica and Chandler Bing later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and adoption of twins {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E

60|$|Caleb {{was quite}} {{surprised}} at the answer; and he walked along {{by the side of}} Dwight and David towards the mole, as they rolled the log along, scarcely knowing what to <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to leave the poor squirrel without his supper; and, on the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go away from the mole. Mary Anna saw his perplexity, and she understood the reason of it.|$|R
60|$|To him also it was agony. He saw the glistening, flower-like love in her face, and {{his heart}} was black because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> it. <b>Not</b> this--not this. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> flowery innocence. <b>He</b> was un{{satisfied}}. The rage and storm of unsatisfaction tormented him ceaselessly. Why had she not satisfied him? He had satisfied her. She was satisfied, at peace, innocent round the doors of her own paradise.|$|R
5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

Kabir explains that the three have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip, each of them will have to pick an adventure sport which all three will try together. Initially, Arjun is reluctant to take trip as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to lose his pay for missing work. It is later revealed that Arjun's former girlfriend left him due to his workaholism and his obsession with money. Imran has an additional secret agenda on the trip, to find his biological father Salman Habib (Naseeruddin Shah), an artist in Spain, about whom he learnt soon {{after the death of}} his step-father.|$|E
60|$|Morel {{gradually}} came to himself. He {{knew where}} he was and what had happened, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to move. <b>He</b> lay still, with tiny bits of snow tickling his face. It was pleasant to lie quite, quite still. The time passed. It was the bits of snow that kept rousing him when <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be roused. At last his will clicked into action.|$|R
