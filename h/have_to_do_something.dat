The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara {{that she thought}} {{it would be good to}} start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family can be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having the whole community behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E

[...] "I never felt like 'Oh fuck I have to finish this record, I have to do one more song, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to this song to make it better,'" [...] Moore said. He {{described}} {{the process of making}} the album as feeling [...] "more like I was playing with this film and I was playing against it so it felt easy somehow".|$|E

500|$|In December 2007, {{the band}} re-released the album as Sacrament: Deluxe Producer Edition. The release {{contained}} {{all of the}} original songs from Sacrament on the first disc, and the second disc was a CD-ROM featuring all of the vocal, bass, guitar, and drum tracks in 192kbit/s MP3 format, enabling the buyer to produce their own interpretation of the songs. Blythe stated, [...] "you sometimes <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> special to get kids to even buy an album these days rather than download it." [...] The band took a break to write new material throughout 2008 and prepare a new record for release, slated for 2009. The band negotiated for a new record label to distribute records outside the United States. Chris Adler stated Epic Records in the United States [...] "couldn't be more perfect", but wants a different label for international releases.|$|E

Production designer Anton Goss, who also designed the set for NBC's The Voice, {{came up with a}} three-story bent-steel structure {{in the shape of a}} giant hourglass laced with lights and containing the custom-made Money Chair - [...] "...on a rooftop with the city behind us...we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> significant...It's like we're building our own little skyscraper." [...] Because of the 18,000 lb weight of the hourglass structure in addition to bleachers full of audience members during show times, the building's rooftop required shoring so that the second floor could help carry the large loads. Geiger Engineers provided the structural engineering for the hourglass and other rooftop structures as well as the required rooftop shoring. Two years after the U.S. version of the show was broadcast, an international version of the show aired on China's Hunan TV in September 2015, entitled [...]|$|E

Pitbull's vocals were recorded by Al Burna at Al Burna Studios, Miami, Florida. Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan and Trevor Muzzy handled audio engineering of the song, with assistance from Anthony Falcone and Peter Mack. O'Ryan and Trevor Muzzy {{were in charge}} of vocal editing. All instruments in the song were played and programmed by RedOne, who also produced the song. The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Lopez revealed that she loved being able to collaborate with RedOne and Pitbull again. She stated: [...] "We had a great chemistry the last time, and it was like 'We're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> again.' And this was the perfect song. I love the message of the song. That when something bad happens, your life is not over. You have to get up. You're gonna live. You're gonna to be okay. You're gonna dance again." ...|$|E
500|$|Marburger {{responded to}} {{criticism}} of his support for Bush administration policies in 2004, stating [...] "No one will know my personal positions on issues as long as I am in this job. I am here {{to make sure that}} the science input to policy making is sound and that the executive branch functions properly with respect to its science and technology missions." [...] On the topic of stem cell research, he in 2004 said that stem cells [...] "offer great promise for addressing incurable diseases and afflictions. But I can’t tell you when a fertilized egg becomes sacred. That’s not my job. That’s not a science issue. And so whatever I think about reproductive technology or choice, or whatever, is irrelevant to my job as a science adviser." [...] However, in February 2005, in a speech at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers, he stated, [...] "Intelligent design is not a scientific theory....

500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|E

500|$|... "The Ring" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have claimed}} that it is this {{censorship}} that gives the Japanese erotic cinema its particular style. Donald Richie says, [...] "American pornography is kept forever on its elemental level because, showing all, it need do nothing else; Japanese eroductions <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else since they cannot show all. The stultified impulse has created some extraordinary works of art, a few films among them. None of these, however, are found among eroductions." [...] Richie is making {{a distinction between the}} erotic films of the major studios such as Nikkatsu and Toei as against the low-budget pink films produced by independents such as OP Eiga.|$|E
