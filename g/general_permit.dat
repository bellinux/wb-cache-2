25|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{wetlands}} permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the Nationwide Permits) are issued for fill activities {{that will result in}} minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a <b>general</b> <b>permit,</b> or that do not meet the conditions of a <b>General</b> <b>Permit.</b> In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit.|$|E
25|$|Two main washes – Moenkopi Wash and Dinnebito Wash - {{pass through}} the mine permit area and {{eventually}} run into the Little Colorado River. Although mining does not occur in these washes, storm water runoff from areas disturbed by mining activities could potentially degrade the quality of water going into them. To prevent degradation of surface waters, sedimentation ponds are constructed under the mine’s surface water protection program. Water quality is monitored and controlled at these ponds, {{as well as at}} livestock watering ponds, seeps and storm water runoff. The program is regulated through the US EPA’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System under NPDES permit No. NN0022179, and Multi-Sector <b>General</b> <b>Permit</b> No. AZR05000I.|$|E

But in the execution of a laborious series of engravings, some must of course be better, some worse; and it would be unjust, no less to the reader than to Giotto, if I allowed this plate to pass without some admission of its inadequacy. It may possibly have been treated with a little less care than the rest, in the knowledge that the finished plate, already in the possession {{of the members of the}} Arundel Society, superseded any effort with inferior means; be that as it may, the tenderness of Giotto's composition is, in the engraving before us, lost to an unusual degree.|$|E
