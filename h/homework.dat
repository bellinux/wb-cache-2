A {{review of the}} existing literature finds both pessimistic and optimistic accounts {{of the impact of}} <b>homeworking</b> on employee attitudes and behaviours.

The findings suggest that <b>homeworking</b> is positively associated with employee well-being and a more balanced work–home relationship. There is no evidence that organizational citizenship behaviours are reduced by <b>homeworking</b> but there is some support for <b>homeworking</b> undermining employees' perception of the organization as supporting their careers and personal development...|$|R

40|$|Although past {{research}} suggests that life stage is an important consideration in the work-life interface, a life stage approach in the work-life literature is uncommon and mostly focused {{on the negative side}} (work-life conflict) of the interface. Accordingly, this dissertation presents a quantitative study (N= 507) that integrates conflict and enrichment into work-life balance by life stage. Drawing on work-life theories (e. g., role scarcity) and life course research, it extends extant knowledge by confirming that work-life balance differs by life stage but not as expected. Employees in the early life stage (rather than those in later stages) had the most beneficial work-life balance. Understanding work-life balance differences by life stage may also help organisations to craft more targeted policies and practices for their employees. This dissertation examines further work-life issues by focusing on the effects of <b>homeworking.</b> It includes a qualitative study (N= 40), supported by quantitative data (N= 514), that explores the situation when <b>homeworking</b> is perceived differently by the employee and the employer. Based on Employee-Organisation Relationship (EOR) concepts (such as Perceived Organisational Support) and an extension of an inducements-contributions model, this dissertation contributes to the EOR literature by integrating employee and employer's perspectives and suggesting that differences in perceptions may produce adverse outcomes, such as employees not meeting their employer's expected contribution. This thesis also explores the role of <b>homeworking</b> in the organisational culture-climate alignment using a multi-model framework of organisational culture-climate. It provides a detailed contextual explanation of the potential adverse impact of <b>homeworking</b> on the organisation with a mixed methods approach. Findings reveal that <b>homeworking</b> may cause tension in the cultureclimate relationship and negatively affect organisational performance. These results contribute to the organisational culture and climate literature and the on-going debate over the consequences of <b>homeworking,</b> and provide a practical illustration of homeworking’s potential drawbacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study examined {{the ways in which}} home is conceptualised, experienced and evaluated by homeworkers, a hard-to-reach group. It explored the impact of <b>homeworking</b> on the experience of home and family life and sought to identify ways in which working from home may challenge the traditional stereotypical view of home. A pilot study suggested that the <b>homeworking</b> experience may be differentiated by economic, spatial and gender factors revealing potential tensions and inequalities among the broad range of people who work from home. The research sought to: explore the existence of supports, inequalities and tensions in the <b>homeworking</b> experience; and establish the particular qualities of home that are enhanced with working from home, as well as those that are limited by this activity. The study used mixed methods, including face-to-face qualitative interviews with individuals and focus groups, and a semi-structured questionnaire, from which a quantitative data file was complied. The qualitative sample consisted of 60 men and women who worked from home (45 individual interviewees, and fifteen other respondents comprising three focus groups), in varied types of work including professional, semi-skilled and unskilled. Four population areas in Northern England and Wales were targeted for this study. The quantitative data set included 62 questionnaires from a separate sample of national homeworkers. Key findings suggest that <b>homeworking</b> is differentiated by gender role, type of work and expectations. Furthermore there are both positive and negative aspects to the <b>homeworking</b> experience for all homeworkers. For example, flexibility is desired and enjoyed but this brings longer working hours. Finally, home is enhanced for some and invaded for others, but most make a conscious effort to make working from home viable. Main Topics : The qualitative interviews cover paid work done at home, how the interviewee began <b>homeworking,</b> location in the home used for work, how family/partner copes with interviewee's home work, enjoyment of <b>homeworking,</b> choice of other jobs outside the home, positive and negative aspects of <b>homeworking,</b> perception of how treated in comparison to other workers, structure of typical working day, separation of work and home life, leisure time activities, breaks from work, local neighbourhood, perceptions of home and changes brought on by working from home. Variables in the quantitative data file include interviewee number (the 45 interviews may be linked by number to the respondent information in the data file), age, gender, rural/urban location, type of work, employment status, employment details and sector, hours of work, employment and <b>homeworking</b> history, living arrangements and household, children and childcare, computer use, community access, ways of working from home, comparison with other ways of working and work locus of control.

40|$|Changes in {{the nature}} of work e. g. Location Independent Working and the growth of <b>homeworking,</b> mean that {{managers}} and their staff may not work in close proximity and so rarely meet in person. The consequent loss of visibility and physical presence creates specific challenges and constraints in relation to the managers' role in the employment relationship. As previous research has compartmentalised the perspectives of homeworkers and their managers, analysis has always been restrictive, lacking in an all-encompassing view of the employment relationship. Seeking to address this disparity, this research assesses the views of both sides of the employment relationship, thereby exploring the experiences of managers and homeworkers. Using contrasting organisations, this research explores how the practice of management control differs in a <b>homeworking</b> environment. The case study organisations suggest that job role, skill level and organisational size can influence a line manager’s ability to exercise control. Direct control is possible for organisations employing low skilled workers undertaking repetitive tasks. Close electronic monitoring of performance stimulates a cyclical process of resistance and increased management surveillance. For an organisation employing highly skilled autonomous workers, direct control is problematic. Managers become increasingly reliant on external proxies of performance. The objectivity of these external measures is questionable, which consequently reduces the manager’s ability to control performance. As a limited amount of research has investigated the practicalities of managing homeworkers, this research is unique as it has explored the influence of <b>homeworking</b> on a manager’s ability to exercise control. Consequently, these findings will offer new insights into the practice of management control in a <b>homeworking</b> environment. As these findings have uncovered some of the specific challenges of <b>homeworking</b> from a managers and homeworkers perspective, the practicalities of managing homeworkers and the potential advantages and drawbacks of working at home may now be more readily understood.

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her <b>homework</b> will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E
