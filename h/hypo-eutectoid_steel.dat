40|$|The {{interest}} towards LASER hardening of steels {{has been}} increasing since {{the last few years}} due to its undoubted advantages. The main drawback affecting this manufacturing technology is the tempering effect induced when multiple passes on the same surface must be carried out. In order to minimize the softening effect due to tempering and to speed up the process a numerical model for the simulation of the treatment is proposed. This model is able to detect the optimal LASER path trajectory according to the source parameters and the scanning velocity, and it is able to predict the resulting microstructures and the relating hardness. Some examples on an <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> are presented together with validation tests...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> {{were chosen}} to study the inhomogenoues {{microstructure}} in crack healing area. Internal cracks were made in 20, 20 MnMo and 45 steel samples. The precracks in 20 and 20 MnMo steel can mostly be healed under the conditions of hot plastic deformation in which the reduction of hot pressing were 35. 6 % and 44. 9 % respectively, and the healing area is a ferrite band. The process of crack healing in crack tips in 45 steel could be finished {{in a very short}} time during upsetting, but there exists inhomogeneity in healing area which include more ferrite, fine grain size and many micro-voids. The reason why ferrite aggregated in healing area is that large deformation and high strain energy at high temperature and low strain rate around crack produce pro-eutectoid ferrite grain precipitating in <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steels.</b> Due to numerous voids restraining the migration of grain boundaries, the grain growth in a healing area becomes a slow process in the crack tips in 45 steel. This results in the grain size in crack tips healing area much finer than that in the steel matrix in 45 steel even after a long time of heat treatment at high temperature...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring forging and {{machining}} manufacturing processes, {{the material}} is subject to large strains at high strain rates which provoke local heating and microstructural changes. Modelling of these phenomena requires precise knowledge of the stress-strain constitutive equations for a large range of strains, strain rates and temperatures. An experimental study of the rheology of both hyper- and <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> (with different microstructures) over a temperature range from 20 °C to 1000 °C and with strain rates from 0. 01 to 100 000 s- 1 has been undertaken. These tests were performed in compression on cylindrical specimens and in shear using hat-shaped specimens. Both a GLEEBLE 3500 thermomechanical testing machine and a Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus were used. From these tests, three deformation domains {{have been identified as}} a function of the material behaviour and of the changes in the deformed microstructure. Each domain was characterized by its behaviour, including the competition between hardening and softening, strain rate sensitivity on the flow stress and the softening phenomenon (i. e. recrystallisation or recovery, etc.). Finally, based on thermodynamical considerations, the conditions of thermoplastic instability (i. e. shear bands, twinning, heterogeneities, etc.) and microstructural changes are highlighted using process maps of the dissipated power repartition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work is {{composed}} of two different techniques, laser hardening using HPDL and conventional pack boriding of EN 8 D steel to improve the mechanical properties. The α-Fe phase observed in the XRD pattern of untreated EN 8 D transformed to martensite and cementite phases due {{to the effect of}} laser irradiation, which is evidenced from the microstructure analysis. The martensite phase in the laser hardened sample results in improved hardness with maximum of about 825 HV 0. 2. In case of pack boriding, the sample was packed with boriding agent and sealed in a stainless steel container at 950 °C for 6 hours. XRD pattern reveals the Fe 2 B peaks, which confirms the formation of borided layer at the sample surface. The hardness value in the tooth like borided layer is increased from 261 HV to 1193 HV due to this Fe 2 B phase. Introduction. Iron-Carbon alloys are the most versatile, economical and globally utilized materials for industrial constructions and engineering systems. Depending on iron and carbon distribution, the microstructures get modified leading to miscellaneous mechanical properties [1]. <b>Hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> with carbon concentration less than 0. 8 wt% {{is composed}} of pearlite microstructure in untreated condition. The lamellar cementite distributed in the ferrite matrix does not possess superior surface properties for industrial and engineering applications [2]. Redistribution of the carbon and iron accordingly modifies the surface properties. Subjecting to heat treatment and customizing the process parameters favors the surface property modification...|$|R
40|$|A 3 D {{numerical}} {{model for the}} surface hardening process simulation carried out {{by means of a}} CO 2 laser source is presented. The model is able to predict the extension of the treated area into the workpiece, the type of the resulting micro-structure and the optimal laser path strategy in order to minimize the micro-structural softening due to the tempering effect. The Fourier equation is solved using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) applied on a generical grid obtained by means of the domain discretization. The resulting time dependent temperature distribution into the workpiece is used for the evaluation of the induced heating cycle. By calculating the cooling velocity, the micro-structure transformation is determined together with the hardness in every point of the domain. The hardness reduction due to the tempering effect is also predictible. The computational times are small and the software is very suitable in industrial environment in the early stage of the process planning when several simulation runs must be performed. The modeling activity was developed by considering the class of the <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steel.</b> The experimental tests were realized on a C 43 steel plate. The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is shown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} the grain size and a little higher Cr content on the kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling of <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> <b>steel.</b> The kinetics of austenite phase transformations during continuous cooling were determined by means of analysis of the dilatometric curves and structure investigations. The influence of the austenite grain size and the higher Cr content was analysed in two hypo-eutectoid steels containing about 0. 4 % C. One of them had, Cr content higher, by about 1 %. In both steels, the austenite grain size was changing insignificantly up to the austenitising temperature of about 950 fl. Above that temperature, the austenite grain size in carbon steel grew much quicker than that in the steel with Cr addition. The austenite grain in the Cr enriched steel was smaller than that in carbon steel and, in spite of that, the duration of cooled austenite transformations were several times longer. This means that the phase transformations are much more strongly influenced by the addition of chromium slowing down carbon diffusion in austenite, than by the austenite grain size. For each phase transformation in the examined steels, the activation energy of the transformation has been determined. The activation energy of all the phase transformations varied slightly with the increase of austenitising temperature. On the basis of the obtained results, curves of true isothermal transformations have been developed for the beginning of the phase transformations in both steels, related to infinitely quick cooling down to the transformation temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{austenite}} decomposition {{has been}} investigated in a <b>hypo-eutectoid</b> plain carbon <b>steel</b> under continuous cooling conditions using a dilatometer and a Gleeble 1500 thermomechanical simulator. The experimental results were used to verify model calculations based on a fundamental approach for the dilute ternary systems Fe-C-Mn. The austenite to ferrite transformation start temperature can be predicted from a nucleation model for slow cooling rates. The formation of ferrite nuclei takes place with equilibrium composition on austenite grain boundaries. The nuclei are assumed to have a pill box shape in accordance with minimal interfacial energy. For higher cooling rates, early growth {{has to be taken}} into account to describe the transformation start. In contrast to nucleation, growth of the ferrite is characterized by paraequilibrium; i. e. only carbon can redistribute, whereas the diffusion of Mn is too slow to allow full equilibrium in the ternary system. However, Mn segregation to the moving ferrite-austenite interface has to be considered. The latter, in turn, exerts a solute drag effect on the boundary movement. Thus, growth kinetics is controlled by carbon diffusion in austenite modified by interfacial segregation of Mn. Employing a phenomenological segregation model, good agreement has been achieved with the measurements...|$|R
