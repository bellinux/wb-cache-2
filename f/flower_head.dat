5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main <b>flower</b> <b>head,</b> while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main <b>flower</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which has a single <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2–12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> a fluffy appearance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{an array}} of <b>flower</b> <b>heads,</b> each surrounded by sharp, spined bracts. The greenish <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> bloom in small, white petals.|$|R
25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{shares with}} B.ser. Dryandra the {{property}} of having compact, dome-shaped <b>flower</b> <b>heads.</b> Structurally, however, Isostylis <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> are quite {{different from those of}} B.ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower spikes of other Banksia taxa. Specifically, Isostylis <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> have an ovoid axis, suggestive of a greatly reduced flower spike, whereas Dryandra <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> emerge from a flat receptable. Furthermore, Isostylis has thick follicles with a woolly coating, whereas Dryandra follicles are thin and hairless; and the involucral, common and floral bracts of Isostylis are unlike those of Dryandra.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flower</b> <b>heads</b> grow in flat-topped {{clusters}} at {{the tops}} of stems. <b>Flower</b> <b>heads</b> have 18-25 yellow disk flowers, with 5-10 yellow ray flowers. Bristly phyllaries halfway enclose the akenes.|$|R
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has markedly pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and {{possibly}} the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that {{gives rise to the}} Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) and Monga waratah (T.mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T.truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing the centre of the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum {{had been}} {{introduced}} to cultivation in England by 1791. German horticulturist Herren Ebritsch obtained material and developed it at his nursery in Arnstadt near Erfurt in Germany. He bred and sold cultivars of many colours from bronze to white to purple, which spread across Europe in the 1850s. The bracts of these early forms tended to remain cupped around the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> rather than flatten out like the native Australian forms. These were also annual rather than perennial forms. Many were given cultivar names such as 'atrococcineum' (dark scarlet flower heads), 'atrosanguineum' (dark blood-red flower heads), 'aureum' (golden yellow flower heads), 'bicolor' (red-tipped yellow flower heads), 'compositum' (large multicoloured flower heads), 'macranthum' (large rose-edged white flower heads), and 'monstrosum' (flower heads with many bracts), although today they are generally sold in mixed seed for growing as annuals. Some coloured forms of South African Helichrysum {{are thought to have}} been introduced to the breeding program, which resulted in the huge array of colours. X. bracteatum was one of several species that became popular with European royalty and nobility from the early 19th century, yet were little noticed in Australia until the 1860s, when they became more prominent in Australian gardens.|$|E
50|$|Sonchus wightianus is a {{perennial}} herb up to 150 cm tall. Stems and the bracts around the <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> have many purple hairs. The plant produces flat-topped arrays of several <b>flower</b> <b>heads,</b> each head with 180-300 yellow ray flowers but no disc flowers.|$|R
50|$|B. subg. Isostylis {{shares with}} B. ser. Dryandra the {{property}} of having compact, dome-shaped <b>flower</b> <b>heads.</b> Structurally, however, Isostylis <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> are quite {{different from those of}} B. ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower spikes of other Banksia taxa.

50|$|The <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> are 6mm long. The bracts of the <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> have a green centre, and chaffy brown edges. The florets are pale brown. The achenes are hairy with reddish pappus hairs.|$|R
25|$|Like {{all members}} of the Asteraceae family, Senecio squalidus has a {{composite}} <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> known as a capitulum. What look like single flowers are actually a cluster of florets, each petal or ligule being a flower, or floret, possessing its own stamen and capable of producing the specialized seed of the family Asteraceae, the parachute-like achene.|$|E
25|$|When Alex George {{published}} his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recognised {{that there were}} several taxa in the series, and that these could be distinguished by their leaf shape. He resurrected a number of abandoned names, and published some new species and varieties. A new circumscription was given for the series: essentially the series was defined as containing those species in which the flowers of a <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> form a circle about a central hole.|$|E
25|$|Dahlias are annual {{blooming}} plants, with mostly tuberous roots. While {{some have}} herbaceous stems, others have stems which lignify {{in the absence}} of secondary tissue and resprout following winter dormancy, allowing further seasons of growth. As a member of the Asteraceae the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> is actually a composite (hence the older name Compositae) with both central disc florets and surrounding ray florets. Each floret is a flower in its own right, but is often incorrectly described as a petal, particularly by horticulturists. The modern name Asteraceae refers to the appearance of a star with surrounding rays.|$|E
50|$|The uncultivated plant {{grows to}} about 30 in (76 cm) in height. It has solitary <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> about 2 inches (5 cm) across. The purple ray florets {{surround}} black and yellow discs. The lanceolate leaves are opposite the <b>flower</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{produces}} daisylike yellow <b>flower</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Its {{blooming}} period occurs from mid-summer {{to early}} fall. Whitegrass {{can be distinguished}} from rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides) by its smoother leaf sheaths, <b>flowering</b> <b>heads</b> with solitary lower branches in the <b>flowering</b> <b>heads,</b> smaller and more strongly overlapping spikelets, and short rhizomes with overlapping scales. Rice cutgrass, in contrast, has leaf sheaths round enough to cause painful scratches, <b>flowering</b> <b>heads</b> with two or more branches at the lowermost nodes, larger and barely overlapping spikelets, and more elongated rhizomes with the scales usually not overlapping.|$|R
25|$|As in all Proteaceae, {{individual}} flowers {{consist of}} a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.acuminata, the perianth is 24–25mm long, pale pink at the base and mauve above, with sticky hairs on the base. The pistil is 29–40mm long, and cream or pink in colour. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the <b>flower</b> <b>head,</b> and usually containing a single winged seed.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} members of the {{composite}} family, the actual flowers appear in two different froms: as ray florets, which have strap-like appendages that look like petals and project around the outside of the capitulum, and as disc florets, which appear {{at the center of the}} <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12mm long by 1.5 to 2.2mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4mm.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the {{dome-shaped}} head characteristic of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches or on short laterals, and consist of from 80 to 100 individual densely packed together and surrounded by a short involucre of narrow, tapering bracts. The hairless tips of these bracts are quite prominent; this is a distinctive characteristic of this species. As in all Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.fraseri, the perianth is 24–28 millimetres long, and pink to cream in colour; and the style 30–42mm long and cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the <b>flower</b> <b>head,</b> and usually containing two winged seeds. In this species each head may set an unusually large number of follicles.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{bloom in}} late winter to early summer, with {{normally}} one or two <b>flower</b> <b>heads</b> per stem, on 15 to 30 cm long peduncles, but sometimes 4 or more heads can be found per stem. <b>Flower</b> <b>heads</b> have 16-21 ray florets with laminae 20-35+ mm long.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flowering</b> <b>heads</b> are sessile, oblong and {{tapering}} at base. The plant {{flowers from}} September to December. The receptacle is naked with 2-5 yellowish hermaphrodite <b>flowers</b> per <b>head.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the colony, {{the queen}} is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} foraging for the nest until workers mature. This includes foraging for wood to make into pulp for the nest as well as food for the larvae. Most workers begin to help with foraging the day after they emerge from the nest as adults. Almost immediately, they take over all foraging activity for the queen. The behavior of the workers who forage differs depending on their activity. Those trying to catch flies move quickly from one <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> to the next and pounce on prey when it is found. In comparison, wasps that forage for nectar move slower and spend more time at each flower. Other workers collect pulp from dead wood to use for nest construction. It appears that if the wasp is unable to quickly catch a fly it goes on to collect nectar suggesting one worker does not always collect the same type of material. Different amounts of time are given to each activity with the most time spent gathering fluid, then pulp, and then flies. Foraging takes place from roughly sunrise to sunset of each day in order {{to keep up with the}} resources needed for the colony.|$|E
500|$|Flowering mostly {{takes place}} from July to November, {{although}} var. sessilis can start {{as early as}} May. After flowering, the flower parts wither and fall away, and up to four follicles develop in the receptable (the base of the <b>flower</b> <b>head).</b> Young follicles are covered in a fine fur, but this is lost as they mature. Mature follicles are ovoid in shape, and measure [...] in length. Most follicles open {{as soon as they}} are ripe, revealing their contents: a woody seed separator and up to two winged seeds.|$|E
500|$|Banksia ilicifolia has a stout trunk up to [...] in diameter, and rough, fibrous, grey bark {{which is}} up to [...] thick. New growth takes place mainly in summer. Young branchlets are covered in hair which they lose {{after two or three}} years. Leaves grow on stems less than two years of age, and are {{arranged}} in a scattered pattern along the stems although crowded at the apices (branchlet tips). Resembling those of holly, its leaves are a dark shiny green colour, and variously [...] (egg-shaped), elliptic, [...] or [...] (wavy) in shape, and [...] long. Generally serrated, the leaf edges have up to 14 prickly [...] "teeth" [...] separated by broad v- to u-shaped sinuses along each side, although some leaves have margins lacking teeth. The leaves sit atop petioles [...] in length. The upper and undersurface of the leaves are initially covered in fine hairs but become smooth with maturity. Flowering takes place from late winter to early summer. The inflorescences are dome-shaped flower heads rather than spikes as many other banksias, and arise from stems that are around a year old. No lateral branchlets grow outwards from the node where the <b>flower</b> <b>head</b> arises. The flower heads measure [...] in diameter, and bear 60 to 100 individual flowers. The inflorescences pass through three colour phases, being initially yellow, then pink, then finally red, before falling away from the head. One to three follicles develop from fertilised flowers, and remain embedded in the woody base of the <b>flower</b> <b>head.</b> Each follicle bears one or two seeds.|$|E

500|$|Banksia oligantha was {{discovered}} by Ken Wallace of the Government of Western Australia's Department of Conservation and Land Management (now the Department of Environment and Conservation) in September 1984, during a survey of Wangeling Gully Nature Reserve (Nature Reserve 9098), about [...] northwest of Wagin. Two months later, on 18 November 1984, Anne Taylor collected from the same location {{what would become the}} type specimen. It was recognised as a new species well before a name was published for it, and was referred to in the interim by the informal names [...] "Banksia aff. Cuneata" [...] and [...] "Banksia sp. Wagin". Alex George included an entry for it under the name Banksia oligantha in the 1987 second edition of his The Banksia Book, but the formal publication of that name did not occur until the following year, when George's [...] "New taxa and notes on Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)" [...] appeared. The specific epithet oligantha derives from the Greek oligo- ("few") and anthos ("flower"), in reference to the low number of flowers per <b>flower</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Brown's {{arrangement}} of Banksia, B.verticillata was placed between B.compar (now B.integrifolia subsp. compar) and B.coccinea (scarlet banksia) in phyletic order. No infrageneric arrangement was provided {{other than the}} removal of one distinctive species into a subgenus of its own, because of its unusual domed <b>flower</b> <b>head.</b> As B.verticillata flowers occur in characteristic flower spikes, it was retained in Banksia verae, the [...] "true banksias". Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1847, with B.verticillata remaining between the same two species as in Brown's sequence. A more detailed arrangement was published by Carl Meissner in 1856. Eubanksia was demoted to sectional rank, and divided it into four series. B.verticillata was placed in series Salicinae because its leaves {{are more or less}} linear, and have white undersides. Based as they were on leaf characters, Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous, and George Bentham discarded them all in his 1870 revision of Banksia. B.verticillata was instead placed in a new section, Oncostylis, because of its hooked styles. This arrangement would stand for over a century.|$|E
