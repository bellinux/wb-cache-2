At the 2009 TV Critics Press Tour, Kevin Reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season. Despite decreasing ratings, Reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity: [...] "The show has just played out. You get to a point creatively where you feel all the stories have been told, and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season." [...] Regarding the finale, Reilly stated, [...] "They have a really cool ending, actually. I know where they end, and it's a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idea." ...|$|E

[...] Borjon complimented the shift in moods throughout the album and the lyrical quality compared to Swan Songs. He praised several tracks including [...] "Been to Hell", [...] "Apologize", [...] "Comin' in Hot", [...] "Bullet", [...] "Levitate", and [...] "Tendencies" [...] as numerous outstanding points in the album. Borjon did criticize the slower songs, [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] and [...] "Pour Me" [...] but dismissed that that were, [...] "easily forgotten among the album's many undeniably addictive future hits." ...|$|E

500|$|Decades later, modern {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the album are generally positive. Bruce Eder of AllMusic considers Shades of Deep Purple, despite some flaws, [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> album" [...] and praises the [...] "infectious (...) spirit of fun" [...] of the disc, which has [...] "much more of a '60s feel than we're accustomed to hearing from this band". Blogcritics contributor David Bowling states that Shades of Deep Purple [...] "was a creative and very good debut album", which combines [...] "psychedelic music with hard rock and early progressive rock into a pleasant but disjointed whole." [...] PopMatters review of the three albums of the Mk. I line-up considers them [...] "both respectable and consistent", although Evans' voice is [...] "perhaps more suited to heavy pop rather than heavy rock".|$|E
500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] was {{performed}} during the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09) {{as the second}} song of the opening segment, [...] "Pimp". After descending the throne during the first song, [...] "Candy Shop", Madonna and her dancers are featured on a 1935 Auburn Speedster {{to the performance of}} the song. Both Williams and West appeared in the videos being displayed on the backdrops. Sarah Liss of CBC News called the performance [...] "pulsating," [...] noting that [...] "her studio collaborators—Pharrell Williams and Kanye West—present in spirit and countenance (their virtual likenesses grimaced from those massive screens) if not in body." [...] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the performance, writing that [...] "by the second song, 'Beat Goes On', it was clear {{that this was going to}} be one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> innovative show." [...] Roffman also pointed out that [...] "a digital Kanye West joined Madonna on stage, rapping along as the singer flipped and bounced on the floor." [...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You know exactly who you are'." [...] The live performance of the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live CD-DVD album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E

Will I get to kill Arabs?". [...] The narrator points {{out that he was}} killed and the reader is then given a choice: [...] "idiot", [...] "sap", or [...] "hero". [...] Later, after revelations of Tillman's privately held anti-Iraq-war sentiments and the friendly fire circumstances of his death became public, Rall wrote that he regretted making such sweeping assumptions about Tillman's motives, describing Tillman as [...] "one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interesting human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the White Album, Cuomo {{discussed}} plans for Weezer's next album, provisionally titled the Black Album: [...] "It’s going to maybe be like Beach Boys gone bad [...] I’m thinking of swearing, which is something I’ve never done in songs.” Cuomo also said the album would tackle “more mature topics” and be “less summer day and more winter night”. He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more [...] "like reveries from a beach {{at the end of the}} world [...] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> amazing baby".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film [...] "a wretched excess." [...] Jay Scott, {{in his review}} for the Globe and Mail, called the film [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{antidote}} to E.T." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "Astonishingly, Carpenter blows it. There's {{a big difference between}} shock effects and suspense, and in sacrificing everything at the altar of gore, Carpenter sabotages the drama. The Thing is so single-mindedly determined to keep you awake that it almost puts you to sleep." [...] David Denby of New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative. [...] In his book Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy described the film as a [...] "surprising failure" [...] and [...] "Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date." [...] The review noted that the narrative [...] "seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero {{is no more than a}} cypher compared to Kenneth Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' The Thing".|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Rolling Stones Christian Hoard stated: [...] "The tunes don't always hold up. But {{the best}} ones are {{impossible}} to dislike." [...] Robert Christgau gave it an [...] "honorable mention" [...] in his consumer guide for MSN Music, citing [...] "You Know I'm No Good" [...] and [...] "Rehab" [...] as highlights and writing, [...] "Pray her marriage lasts—she's observant, and it would broaden her perspective". Pitchfork critic Joshua Klein criticised Winehouse's [...] "defensive", subjective lyrics concerning relationships, but added that [...] "Winehouse has been blessed by a brassy voice that can transform even mundane sentiments into powerful statements". Douglas Wolk, writing for Blender, said that the album [...] "sounds fantastic—partly because the production nails sample-ready '60s soul {{right down to the}} drum sound; and partly because Winehouse is one <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impressive singer, especially when she's not copping other people's phrasing". In a retrospective review for Rolling Stone in 2010, Wolk gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and referred to it as [...] "an unlikely marvel, a desperately sad and stirring record whose hooks and production (by Remi and Mark Ronson) are worthy of the soul hall-of-famers she namedrops—'Tears Dry On Their Own' is basically 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' recast as self-recrimination".|$|E

In this despair, and because [...] "change" [...] at any hazard and any cost is strongly urged upon me by both my Doctors, and {{is a part of}} the regular process of dénouement of my accursed ill, I am in all probability trying to scramble up to London by the end of this week, even if I have to tumble, howling, out of bed and go forth in my bedclothes. I shall go in this case to Garlant's Hotel, Suffolk Street, where you have already seen me, and not to my Club, which is impossible in illness, nor to my little flat (21 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, S.W.) which will not yet, or for another three or four weeks, be ready for me.

6000|$|Savonarola and his {{republic}} fell. The drug of despotism {{was administered}} to the people, and they forgot what they had been. There are some at the present day who have so strange a respect for art and letters, and for mere men of genius, that they conceive {{the reign of the}} Medici to be an improvement on that of the great Florentine republican. It is such men as these and their civilisation that we have at the present day to fear. We are surrounded on many sides by the same symptoms as those which awoke the unquenchable wrath of Savonarola--a hedonism that is more sick of happiness than an invalid is sick of pain, an art sense that seeks the assistance of crime since it has exhausted nature. In many modern works we find veiled and horrible hints of a truly Renaissance sense of the beauty of blood, the poetry of murder. The bankrupt and depraved imagination does not see that a living man is far more dramatic than a dead one. Along with this, as in the time of the Medici, goes the falling back into the arms of despotism, the hunger for the strong man which is unknown among strong men. The masterful hero is worshipped as he is worshipped by the readers of the [...] "Bow Bells Novelettes," [...] and for the same reason--a profound sense of personal weakness. That tendency to devolve our duties descends on us, which is the soul of slavery, alike whether for its menial tasks it employs serfs or emperors. Against all this the great clerical republican stands in everlasting protest, preferring his failure to his rival's success. The issue is still between him and Lorenzo, between the responsibilities of liberty and the license of slavery, between the perils of truth and the security of silence, between the pleasure of toil and the toil of pleasure. The supporters of Lorenzo the Magnificent are assuredly among us, men for whom even nations and empires only exist to satisfy the moment, men to whom the last hot hour of summer is better than a sharp and wintry spring. They have an art, a literature, a political philosophy, which are all alike valued for their immediate effect upon the taste, not for what they promise of the destiny of the spirit. Their statuettes and sonnets are rounded and perfect, while [...] "Macbeth" [...] is in comparison a fragment, and the Moses of Michael Angelo a hint. Their campaigns and battles are always called triumphant, while Cæsar and Cromwell wept for many humiliations. And the end of it all is the hell of no resistance, the <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unfathomable softness, until the whole nature recoils into madness and the chamber of civilisation is no longer merely a cushioned apartment, but a padded cell.|$|E
