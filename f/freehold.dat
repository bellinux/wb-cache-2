5|$|Route 33 Business {{begins at}} the {{interchange}} with Route 33, its parent route, in Manalapan Township, New Jersey. A short distance after, the interchange from Route 33 eastbound merges into Route 33 Business, and the route passes {{to the south of}} Monmouth Battlefield State Park and enters <b>Freehold</b> Township. Soon after entering the borough of <b>Freehold,</b> Route 33 Business interchanges with U.S. Route 9. Route 33 Business turns to the southeast, passing to the north of <b>Freehold</b> Raceway. A short distance later, Route 33 Business intersects at a traffic light with New Jersey Route 79 (South Street) in downtown <b>Freehold.</b> At the intersection with Fairfield Road, Route 33 Business enters the interchange with Route 33 and the freeway, where the designation terminates.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} how households trade off immediate costs and uncertain future benefits {{that occur in}} the very long run, 100 or more years away. We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the U. K. and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or <b>freeholds.</b> Leaseholds are temporary, pre-paid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while <b>freeholds</b> are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and <b>freeholds</b> reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiry, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to <b>freeholds</b> and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary datasets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100 -year leaseholds are valued at more than 10 % less than otherwise identical <b>freeholds,</b> implying discount rates below 2. 6 % for 100 -year claims...|$|R

5|$|In the unreformed House of Commons to {{be either}} a {{candidate}} or an elector for a county seat, a man had to own (not rent) <b>freehold</b> property valued for the land tax at two pounds a year (women could neither vote nor stand for election). This {{was known as the}} 40/- <b>freehold.</b> The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Originally in Peterborough the dean and chapter had claimed the franchise and held that only residents of Minster Precincts were burgesses. By the interregnum, the city was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this was 576, or about one per cent of the population. Bribery was general until the introduction of the secret ballot under the Ballot Act 1872. Votes were cast by spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, erected on the Market Place (now Cathedral Square).|$|E
5|$|A large {{interchange}} {{near the}} Naval Weapons Station Earle serves Industrial Way West, County Route 547 (Wyckoff Road), New Jersey Route 36, Hope Road, the Garden State Parkway, the Tinton Falls interchange (exit 105), and County Route 38 (Wayside Road). The route continues northwestward into Colts Neck. The freeway continues {{to the northwest}} through wooded land for several miles, crossing over Normandy Road and {{to the south of}} the Pebble Creek Golf Club. Exits along this stretch include New Jersey Route 34, County Route 537 (Colts Neck Road), New Jersey Route 79 (South Main Street), County Route 520, and County Route 3 (Tennent Road), which connects to <b>Freehold</b> Borough and Marlboro.|$|E
5|$|A local landowner, E. D. Till, leased {{the castle}} in 1897 and {{undertook}} restoration work. Agnes Lady Fountain {{took over the}} lease {{after his death in}} 1917. She agreed to a plan to protect the castle, under which she purchased the <b>freehold</b> and transferred this to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1937; then, once the leasehold on the property had expired, the castle was passed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1948.|$|E

Deborah Linton of the Manchester Evening News claimed the cost of the <b>freeholds</b> would be in the region of £15 million; and it later emerged that £15.9 million was paid.|$|R
5|$|After {{agreement}} {{from the}} Cardiff Athletic Club, the <b>freehold</b> {{of the south}} ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July 1968. Work could then begin on the new National Stadium. Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to Sophia Gardens and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would {{move out of the}} south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} into Greene County, {{the road}} intersects NY23A at an undeveloped junction. NY32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment, passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of Kiskatom, then winding around {{the north side}} of Cairo Roundtop before it joins with NY23 at Cairo. After , NY32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two-lane route. It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north-northeast just south of <b>Freehold.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a <b>freehold</b> in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E

5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the <b>freehold</b> ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing {{the foundations of the}} buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities. By 1984, when the government agency English Heritage took over the management of the property, the condition of the visitor services was unsatisfactory and the industrial character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists.|$|E
5|$|Gan {{was always}} {{among the first}} to respond to pleas for donations, giving {{thousands}} of dollars to local hospitals. He also helped to pay for coffins to bury the poor. The 1892 annual report of Tan Tock Seng Hospital mentioned that Gan donated a <b>freehold</b> property at Rochor to the hospital. The hospital is still serving the public and came into the international spotlight when it was designated as the sole treatment centre for the SARS epidemic which struck Singapore in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the club's owners {{announced}} a modernisation of Stamford Bridge {{with plans for}} a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the <b>freehold</b> being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.|$|E
50|$|Elemental League/Elemental <b>Freeholds</b> - A {{splinter}} faction from Tezla's original empire, the Elemental League focuses {{mostly on}} Elemental magic, or magic of life. Opposed {{primarily to the}} Necropolis Sect/Dark Crusaders, they lost much ground and many troops to the latter faction. Eventually, they came to be more scattered, and fought {{to keep from being}} wiped out completely. As 2.0's story begins, they retreated to an Elven castle in the forest and became the Elemental <b>Freeholds.</b> Distantly related to the Elven Lords, they are neither strong allies nor bitter enemies with them. Their 2.0 subfactions are the Wylden Host and Storm Druids.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing <b>freehold</b> arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleeve became Crown property, it was leased to Anthony Busterd for 21years. In 1538, the <b>freehold</b> of {{the site}} was granted to Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. The church was demolished, save for the south wall which bounded the cloister, {{and the rest of}} the abbey {{converted}} into a mansion suitable for a gentleman. By the early seventeenth century, however, Cleeve had turned into a farm. The dormitory was now a large barn, the cloister was the farmyard {{and the rest of the}} buildings were used for agricultural purposes and a farm house. A red sandstone barn was built which abuts the south-west corner of the abbey.|$|E
5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of <b>freehold</b> property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling <b>freehold,</b> was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E
