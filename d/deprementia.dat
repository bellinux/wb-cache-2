Background. We illustrated an example of structure equation modelling (SEM) in the research on SHS to explore the diagnosis of the Sub optimal health status (SHS) and provide evidence for the standardization of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns in SHS. And the diagnosis of 4 TCM patterns in SHS was evaluated in this analysis. Methods. This study assessed data on 2807 adults (aged 18 to 49) with SHS from 6 clinical centres. SEM was {{used to analyze the}} patterns of SHS in TCM. Parameters in the introduced model were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Results. The discussed model fits the SHS data well with CFI = 0. 851 and RMSEA = 0. 075. The direct effect of Qi deficiency pattern on dampness pattern had the highest magnitude (value of estimate is 0. 822). With regard to the construct of “Qi deficiency pattern”, “fire pattern”, “stagnation pattern ” and “dampness pattern”, the indicators with the highest load were myasthenia of limbs, vexation, <b>deprementia,</b> and dizziness, respectively.

It had been shown that estimate factor should indicate the important degree of different symptoms in pattern. Conclusions. The weights of symptoms in the respective pattern can be statistical significant and theoretical meaningful for the 4 TCM patterns identification in SHS research. The study contributed to a theoretical framework, which has implications for the diagnosis points of SHS...|$|E
