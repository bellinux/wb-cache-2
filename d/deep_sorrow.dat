500|$|Waugh had {{welcomed the}} {{accession}} in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly {{concerned by the}} decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Paul VI until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by {{the replacement of the}} universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a Spectator article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as [...] "sharp-edged reasonableness".

500|$|Later in 1939, Prokofiev {{composed}} his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, {{widely known}} today as the [...] "War Sonatas." [...] Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, [...] "having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created" [...] (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, [...] "expressed his true feelings". As evidence, Jaffé {{has pointed out that}} the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, [...] "I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the <b>deep</b> <b>sorrow</b> in the song." [...] Ironically (it appears no one noticed his allusion), Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class), and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).|$|E
