5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an <b>isotherm</b> analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} <b>isotherm</b> gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate the effects of manufacturing parameters on the moisture sorption <b>isotherms</b> of some tablet formulations and to predict the moisture <b>isotherms</b> of the final formulations using polynomial equations. Three tablet formulations including a placebo and 2 drug products were prepared through wet granulation, drying, compression, and coating processes. Equilibrium moisture content of excipients and granules at 25 °C with different relative humidities were determined using a dynamic moisture sorption microbalance, while such data for tablets were determined using desiccators. Moisture sorption <b>isotherms</b> were expressed in polynomial equations. Excipient <b>isotherms</b> were used to predict the moisture sorption <b>isotherms</b> of the 3 tablet products. Results showed that different physical properties of granules and tablets, such as particle size distribution, density, and porosity resulting from different granulation and compression conditions did not have significant effect on the moisture <b>isotherms</b> of the materials. Changing coating materials from a powder mixture to a film also did not change the moisture sorption characteristics significantly. The predicted moisture sorption <b>isotherms</b> of the formulations agreed well with the experimental results. These results show that moisture <b>isotherms</b> of solid pharmaceutical products manufactured with conventional processes may be predicted using the <b>isotherms</b> of excipients, and polynomial equations may be used as a tool for the prediction of moisture <b>isotherms...</b>|$|R

Her chance came in 1935, when, thanks to George Gamow, Teller was invited to the United States to become a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, where he worked with Gamow until 1941. At George Washington University in 1937, Teller {{predicted}} the Jahn–Teller effect, which distorts molecules in certain situations; this affects the chemical reactions of metals, and in particular the coloration of certain metallic dyes. Teller and Hermann Arthur Jahn analyzed it as a piece of purely mathematical physics. In collaboration with Stephen Brunauer and Paul Hugh Emmett, Teller also made an important contribution to surface physics and chemistry: the so-called Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) <b>isotherm.</b> Teller and Mici became naturalized citizens of the United States on March 6, 1941.|$|E

The composition comprises a mixture of two or more hydrides, each hydride having a different series of hydrogen sorption <b>isotherms</b> that contribute to the overall <b>isotherms</b> of the mixture. The hydrides are chosen so that the <b>isotherms</b> of the mixture have regions wherein the H equilibrium pressure increases with increasing hydrogen, preferably linearly. The <b>isotherms</b> of the mixture can be adjusted by selecting hydrides with different <b>isotherms</b> and by varying the amounts of the individual hydrides, or both.

The composition is activated by degassing, exposing to H, and then heating below the softening temperature of any of the constituents.

The CG lipid model gives predictions that are very close to those of atomistic simulations, while greatly improving computational efficiency. There is much more variation among experimental <b>isotherms</b> than between <b>isotherms</b> obtained from CG simulations and from the most refined simulation available.

30|$|It {{was argued}} that {{a change in the}} thermophoresis force is due to a change in the local {{temperature}} gradients. To investigate this hypothesis, Fig.  3 shows the variation of the <b>isotherms</b> versus the inclination angle for a particle loading of 5  % (ϕ = 0.05). Considerable distortion in <b>isotherms</b> is observed with a change in the inclination angle. Similar qualitative observations of <b>isotherms</b> have been already made in previous works based on a single-phase model, e.g., [10]; however, the present results are more accurate given that a two-phase method is employed combined with a reliable expression for the thermophoresis force. At Ra = 104, weak flows are induced in the cell, and therefore a gradual change from conduction limit at low Ra numbers to convection at higher Ra numbers is observed. Close to the hot and cold walls, the <b>isotherms</b> are parallel to the wall surface indicating a 1 D conduction dominant heat transfer, while {{in the center of the}} cell, mixing and convection is stronger resulting in distortion of the <b>isotherms.</b> It is generally observed that at tilted angles of 30 ° and 60 °, close to the hot and cold walls, the <b>isotherms</b> spacing decreases, indicating a higher heat transfer rate. As the Ra number increases, the spacing between the <b>isotherms</b> adjacent to the heated and cooled walls further decreases, which is indicative of an increase in the heat transfer rate. Also with an increase in the inclination angle, the <b>isotherms</b> at Ra = 106 attain a more random contour form. The presence of the suspended nanoparticles and a relative drift or slip velocity between the particles and the base fluid is responsible for the irregular shape of the <b>isotherms.</b>|$|R
