Author offers a new propulsion system using electrons for acceleration of the craft and having a high efficiency.

It can work in any planet atmosphere (gas, liquid) and at very high altitude. The system can use apparatus surface for thrust and braking.

40|$|The ACES Program {{began the}} {{investigation}} of regeneratively cooled <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines</b> for propelling aircraft at Mach 6 to 8 flight regimes while collecting and processing air for later use as oxidizer in rocket propulsion into an orbit flight mode. The Marquardt Company had as its prime task the design and demonstration of a ramjet capable of steady state operating using hydrogen as the regenerative coolant and with fuel flow limited to a theta = 1. Marquardt progressed from shell type combustors to advanced tubular combustion chambers in direct connect test rigs. The first tests were made with water cooled center bodies and plug nozzles using a pebble bed air heater to simulate flight air temperature. Later tests were made on completely H 2 cooled flight weight V/G assemblies direct connected to a SUE burner heater. Design studies were also conducted on integrated systems for take-off capability using offset turbojets connected to 2 -D or axisymmetric inlets. An 18 inch <b>hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet</b> evaluation scale model was designed based on the hot test results using a fully V/G inlet and exit nozzle. This thruster would provide 25000 lbs. of thrust with an estimated weight of 250 lbs. A V/G inlet would also incorporate an inlet seal for possible take-off thrust by rocket operation. <b>Hypersonic</b> <b>ramjet</b> construction features and chamber thrust development are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCombined-cycle pulse {{detonation}} {{engines are}} promising contenders for hypersonic propulsion systems. In the present study, design and propulsive performance analysis of combined-cycle pulse detonation turbofan engines (PDTEs) is presented. Analysis {{is done with}} respect to Mach number at two consecutive modes of operation: (1) Combined-cycle PDTE using a pulse detonation afterburner mode (PDA-mode) and (2) combined-cycle PDTE in pulse detonation <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine</b> mode (PDRE-mode). The performance of combined-cycle PDTEs is compared with baseline afterburning turbofan and <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines.</b> The comparison of afterburning modes is done for Mach numbers from 0 to 3 at 15. 24 km altitude conditions, while that of pulse detonation <b>ramjet</b> <b>engine</b> (PDRE) is done for Mach 1. 5 to Mach 6 at 18. 3 km altitude conditions. The analysis shows that the propulsive performance of a turbine engine can be greatly improved by replacing the conventional afterburner with a pulse detonation afterburner (PDA). The PDRE also outperforms its ramjet counterpart at all flight conditions considered herein. The gains obtained are outstanding for both the combined-cycle PDTE modes compared to baseline turbofan and <b>ramjet</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|R
