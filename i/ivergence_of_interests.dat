40|$|Conflicts <b>of</b> <b>{{interests}}</b> arise due to {{the fact}} that a person’s right to demand to act in his interests imposes a duty on another person to act in such a way. Different concepts <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in various sectors and their problems are analyzed in the article. Whereas there is no unified concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> used in practice it is unclear which types of relations are regarded as conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> when conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> arises and what are the solutions to it. Due to these reasons universal concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is constructed and elements <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are analyzed in this article. The concept <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is discussed in the context of agency theory in the broad sense, i. e. in the legal and economic sense. Theoretical model and types <b>of</b> conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> are particularly important while trying to solve conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> There are two main categories of solutions: preventive and managing measures. Preventive measures are intended to avoid conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> before it arises and managing measures are intended to manage already risen conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> and to prevent negative consequences.

40|$|Although both {{financial}} and intrinsic conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can exist throughout the drug develop-ment process, {{little is known}} about how advanced cancer patients enrolled onto early phase clinical trials perceive investigator conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Patients and Methods We interviewed 102 advanced cancer patients enrolled onto phase I clinical trials using a standardized survey that addressed multiple issues related to conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and research participation. Results Fifty-five percent of patients would not be concerned if physicians involved in running a clinical trial had financial conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> whereas 65 % of patients would be concerned if physicians involved in running a trial had intrinsic conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Most patients reported that potential conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> should be disclosed to patients on research trials (52 % for financial conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and 61 % for more intrinsic conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest).</b> Most patients would be willing to participate in trials after learning conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> information (63 %). Younger patients expressed more concern regarding financial conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> than older patients (odds ratio, 6. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 41 to 27. 24). Conclusion Patients with advanced cancer are equally, if not more, concerned about traditional intrinsic conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as compared with financial conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Patients generally believed that conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> information should be disclosed to research participants. The fact that younger patients expressed more concern about financial conflicts <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> may have the potential to influence clinical trial participation rates. The actual impact <b>of</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> disclosure to research subjects needs to be evaluated more carefully.

40|$|According to Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy {{the money}} rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{depends on the}} natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> but the latter {{does not depend on}} the former. If this Classical Dichotomy is false {{monetary}} policy may induce hysteresis because the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> would depend upon the money rate <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> We use data for Israel to test Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy. We proxy the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> by the forward yield to maturity on indexed-linked treasury bonds. If the null hypothesis is false it is difficult to suggest persuasive instruments that would identify the causal effect of the money rate on the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Our identification strategy is therefore built around quasi-experimentation and event analysis. Large and seemingly orthogonal shocks to the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> have no measurable effect on the natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> according to non-parametric and parametric tests. Therefore, Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy is empirically valid. Natural rate <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> Monetary policy Event analysis Indexed bonds Neutrality of monetary policy Identification...|$|R

50|$|The gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{directly}} causes {{production of}} protein(s) or RNA that produce a desired trait or phenotype, whereas markers (a DNA sequence or the morphological or biochemical markers produced {{due to that}} DNA) are genetically linked to the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and the marker tend to move together during segregation of gametes due to their proximity on the same chromosome and concomitant reduction in recombination (chromosome crossover events) between the marker and gene <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> For some traits, the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> has been discovered {{and the presence of}} desirable alleles can be directly assayed {{with a high level of}} confidence. However, if the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is not known, markers linked to the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> can still be used to select for individuals with desirable alleles of the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> When markers are used there may be some inaccurate results due to inaccurate tests for the marker. There also can be false positive results when markers are used, due to recombination between the marker <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and gene (or QTL). A perfect marker would elicit no false positive results. The term 'perfect marker' is sometimes used when tests are performed to detect a SNP or other DNA polymorphism in the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> if that SNP or other polymorphism is the direct cause of the trait <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The term 'marker' is still appropriate to use when directly assaying the gene <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> because the test of genotype is an indirect test of the trait or phenotype <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|R
