In 2005, elemental chlorine was used in 19-20% of kraft pulp production globally, down from over 90% in 1990. 75% of kraft pulp used ECF, with the remaining 5-6% using TCF. A study based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data concluded that [...] "Studies of effluents from mills that use oxygen delignification and <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> to produce ECF (elemental chlorine free) and TCF pulps suggest that the environmental effects of these processes are low and similar."Most TCF pulp is produced in Sweden and Finland for sale in Germany, all markets {{with a high level}} of environmental awareness.

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} and cost reduction {{have been the}} focus of pretreatment and <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> in Kraft pulping for some time now. Previous work has looked at the diffusion of tritiated water into softwood chips. This thesis looks at the diffusion of Na 2 S into southern pine softwood chips. Two size fractions were used. The measured diffusion data were compared to the equilibrium of mixing between the HS ion and water alone. Since pine is porous, effective diffusivities were calculated for each size fraction using a 1 -dimensional model. Tortuosities were then calculated for the HS / pine wood system. These diffusivities are compared to values previously obtained for tritiated water. M. S. Committee Chair: Sujit Banerjee; Committee Member: Jeff Empie; Committee Member: Yulin Den...|$|E
30|$|GL {{pretreatment}} {{was developed}} for semi-chemical and kraft cookings in 1970 s. It was reported that southern pine is cooked by GL containing about 29  % total alkali charge to give a pulp with a yield of about 70  % [1]. After the concept of <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> was developed [2], GL pretreatment was reported to improve its selectivity and pulp quality [3, 4]. Later, GL pretreatment of wood chip for bioethanol production was developed and reported that enzymatic saccharification of wood chip pretreated with GL is much more efficient than that pretreated with kraft cooking when compared at the same lignin content [5, 6]. Because lots of kraft pulp mills have recently been closed, it has become attractive to repurpose the mills into bioethanol plants [5, 6]. It is the special advantage in this repurposing that the mills already have equipments sufficient and proper as bioethanol plants [5, 6]. Moreover, an enzymatic hydrolysis subsequent to a GL pretreatment was reported to saccharify more efficiently and be freer from inhibitive substances than that subsequent to an acid pretreatment [5 – 8].|$|E
40|$|<b>Extended</b> oxygen <b>delignification</b> {{of three}} types of {{alkaline}} pulps from Pinus radiata D. Don was investigated. Kraft, kraft-anthraquinone (kraft-AQ), and soda-anthraquinone (soda-AQ) pulps at 40 and 60 Kappa number were treated with oxygen to remove about 60, 70, and 75 % of their residual lignin. Extended oxygen treatments resulted in less selective delignification, higher brightness at a given Kappa number, and generally less strength degradation in 60 Kappa than in 40 Kappa pulps; and in less selective delignification, lower brightness at a given Kappa number, and lower strength in soda-AQ pulps than in kraft and kraft-AQ pulps. The yields of kraft-AQ and soda-AQ pulps remained {{higher than those of}} kraft pulps after <b>extended</b> oxygen <b>delignification.</b> At 25 Kappa number use of extended oxygen treatments increased total yields by 3 % over those attainable through continued pulping. With careful control, oxygen delignification of alkaline pulps could be extended to at least 60 % lignin removal before significant strength losses occurred...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this program was to develop improved <b>extended</b> oxygen <b>delignification</b> (EOD) technologies for current U. S. pulp mill operations. This was accomplished by: (1) Identifying pulping conditions that optimize O and OO performance; (2) Identifying structural features of lignin that enhance reactivity towards EOD of high kappa pulps; (3) Identifying factors minimizing carbohydrate degradation and improve pulp strength of EOD high kappa pulps; (4) Developing a simple, reproducible method of quantifying yield gains from EOD; and (5) Developing process conditions that significantly reduce the capital requirements of EOD while optimizing the yield benefits. Key research outcomes included, demonstrating {{the use of a}} mini-O sequence such as (E+O) Dkf: 0. 05 (E+O) or Dkf: 0. 05 (E+O) (E+O) without interstage washing could capture approximately 60 % of the delignification efficiency of a conventional O-stage without the major capital requirements associated with an O-stage for conventional SW kraft pulps. The rate of formation and loss of fiber charge during an O-stage stage can be employed to maximize net fiber charge. Optimal fiber charge development and delignification are two independent parameters and do not parallel each other. It is possible to utilize an O-stage to enhance overall cellulosic fiber charge of low and high kappa SW kraft pulps which is beneficial for physical strength properties. The application of NIR and multi-variant analysis was developed into a rapid and simple method of determining the yield of pulp from an oxygen delignification stage that has real-world mill applications. A focus point of this program was the demonstration that Kraft pulping conditions and oxygen delignification of high and low-kappa SW and HW pulps are intimately related. Improved physical pulp properties and yield can be delivered by controlling the H-factor and active alkali charge. Low AA softwood kraft pulp with a kappa number 30 has an average improvement of 2 % in yield and 4 cP in viscosity in comparison to high AA pulp for the oxygen delignification. This difference is also seen for high-kappa SW kraft pulps with an average improvement of {approx} 3 % in yield and 3 cP in viscosity for low AA high kappa number 50 pulp. Low AA hardwood kappa number 20 pulp had an average improvement of {approx} 4 % in yield and 6 - 12 cP in viscosity as compared to high AA pulp. Lower kraft cooking temperature (160 vs. 170 C) in combination with the medium AA provides a practical approach for integrating high kappa pulping of hardwoods (i. e., low rejects) with an advanced <b>extended</b> oxygen <b>delignification</b> stage.

40|$|In this study, {{engineering}} {{reaction kinetics}} of sulfite and sulfite-anthraquinone pulping of black spruce wood are investigated. The considered sulfite processes are neutral-sulfite (NS), neutral sulfite-anthraquinone (NS-AQ), neutral sulfite semichemical (NSSC) and neutral sulfite semichemical anthraquinone (NSSC-AQ). In preliminary studies, an experimental design was tested and optimum kinetic conditions were found so that penetration and diffusion {{would not be}} the rate-controlling steps and the amount of anthraquinone would not be reaction limiting. Delignification and carbohydrate degradation rate expressions for both NS and NS-AQ pulping were developed. Research was <b>extended</b> to develop <b>delignification</b> rate expressions for NSSC and NSSC-AQ pulping. The degree of delignification was measured by determining the lignin content of the pulp. Carbohydrate content in the pulp was estimated from the difference between the pulp yield and the residual lignin in the pulp. Reaction temperature and pulping chemical concentrations were held essentially constant in all kinetic experiments. Isothermal experiments were conducted in the temperature range between 165 and 180 $ sp circ$C. A concentration of 150 g/l sodium sulfite with a liquor-to-wood ratio of 62 was used. The effect of sulfite concentration on the delignification rate expressions for NS and NS-AQ pulping was also investigated. The rates of delignification were determined at 175 $ sp circ$C over the concentration range of 54 to 154 grams sodium sulfite per liter. It was observed that the reaction rate orders with respect to sodium sulfite charge were 0. 3 and 0 for the delignification rate of NS and NS-AQ pulping respectively. The applicability of the H-factor for predicting pulping characteristics during NS-AQ and NSSC-AQ pulping was confirmed. The role of anthraquinone as a redox catalyst in NS-AQ was investigated. It was observed that anthraquinone is reduced in NS liquor, and that the redox cycle is involved in NS-AQ pulping...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} project ASAM pulping of different annual plants was investigated {{and the resulting}} pulps were bleached in total chlorine free sequences. Pulping of wheat straw and sorghum bagasse resulted in good yields and acceptable pulp strength. Flax and rice straw pulping yielded less satisfying results. The best pulps could be produced from miscanthus. Yield and strength properties of ASAM pulps were superior to soda pulps. ASAM pulping could be improved by different process modifications. This refers in particular to the reject content of the pulps and the energy demand for cooking. Progress could be made in chlorine free bleaching of ASAM pulps. In softwood pulp bleaching kappa numbers of about 25 are the best starting point for bleaching. Two stages oxygen delignification partly reinforced by peroxide result in an <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> of the pulps.

40|$|The world {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} continues to expand production and increasingly, plants are being built in newly industrialised countries. The dominant process is the kraft or sulphate process. Historically, substantial pollution problems have been associated with pulp manufacturing operations. Following the recognition of large scale environmental contamination by organochlorines due to their formation in bleach plants, the industry implemented a number of process internal changes and continued to develop process external treatment processes. The bleach plant of kraft mills generates a substantial proportion of the total process effluents. The introduction of <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> and oxygen delignification can substantially reduce the quantities of lignin entering the bleach plant. Residues from oxygen delignification can be cycled to the recovery process. Overall, this reduces the demand for bleaching agents and hence reduces the generation of organochlorines. Together with substitution of elemental chlorine (Cl 2) with chlorine dioxide, these systems have substantially reduced levels of AOX being discharged from bleach kraft mills. Organochlorines, however, have not been eliminated from discharges, merely reduced. Swedish research has shown detectable levels of toxicologically chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans in the effluents from mills that use chlorine dioxide; so-called elemental chlorine free (ECF) mills.

40|$|The {{authors have}} been {{pursuing}} strategies {{for improving the}} efficiency of utilization and environmental performance of ClO{sub 2 } in the delignification of kraft pulps. These strategies combine a pretreatment followed by ClO{sub 2 } treatment under conditions selected to result in high efficiency, and a suitably altered alkaline extraction stage. In addition, a series of experiments was completed in which the authors compared the response to conventional D(EO) delignification of conventional kraft pulps and pulps from a laboratory simulation of Ahlstrom`s Lo-Solids{reg_sign} <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> (modified) process.

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus {{wood chips}} were decayed by the lignin-degrading fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora as a {{pretreatment}} step before kraft pulping. Weight and component losses of wood after the biotreatment were the following: weight (5 %), glucans (1. 5 %), xylans (4. 3 %), lignin (5. 7 %) and extractives (57. 5 %). The residual amount of lignin (expressed by the kappa number) in pulps from biotreated wood chips {{was lower than}} that of pulps from the undecayed control. Depending on the delignification degree, kraft biopulps presented similar or up to 4 % increase in pulp yield and 20 % less hexenuronic acids (HexA) than control pulps. The <b>extended</b> <b>delignification</b> with O 2 decreases approximately 50 % of the kappa number of the pulps and increases brightness, but had no effect in HexA reduction. The bleaching steps with chlorine dioxide (D 0 ED 1 sequence) decreased the kappa number up to 97 %, increased pulp brightness up to 84 % ISO and decreased HexA amount up to 91 %. The use of C. subvermispora in biopulping of E. globulus generated important benefits during the production of kraft pulps that are reflected in a high pulp yield, low residual lignin content, low HexA amount, high brightness and viscosity of the biopulps as compared with pulps produced from untreated wood chips. </p...|$|E
40|$|The pulp {{industry}} in Thailand is {{of economic and}} social importance because of its production value, the revenues from export and the employment in this sector. The eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry plays an important role due to its large share in pulp production in Thailand. The demand for Kraft pulp has been increasing {{as a result of the}} growth in the manufacturing sector, increasing living standards and new export markets. However, this industry also contributes to several environmental problems, which need to be addressed with an integrated study. The overall objective of this thesis is to analyse the environmental pressure of the eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp {{industry in}} Thailand, and to identify options to reduce these pressures and evaluate their cost-effectiveness. Possible future trends (2000 - 2020) in the potential environmental impact of this industry, taking into account the technical and economical implications of combinations of environmental reduction options are also analyzed. The study focuses on the overall environmental impact as well as on six specific environmental problems: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, smog, human toxicity and the production of solid waste. The environmental systems analysis (ESA) is used as a main tool in this thesis, to answer three research questions. Current environmental pressure of eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry in Thailand The first research question is to determine the current environmental pressure of eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry in Thailand. To this end, the first and second step of the environmental systems analysis were performed. These include problem definition and system definition. A clear definition of the system is given by defining the system inputs, outputs and internal relations. The analysis reveals which inputs, outputs and processes have to be taken into account and which can be omitted. We distinguish between two subsystems within the Kraft pulp industry: eucalyptus forestry and Kraft pulp production. Environmental indicators and a partial life cycle analysis are the tools used for this analysis. The results indicate that the environmental pressure of the Kraft pulp production exceeds that of eucalyptus forestry. In terms of activities causing environmental problems, the chemical recovery unit was found to be the most important source of global warming and acidification, because it is responsible for more than 50 % of the emissions of greenhouse gases and acidifying compounds. Biomass combustion contributes by about 80 % to the emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors and human toxicity substances. Almost three quarters of the eutrophying compounds are from wastewater treatment. In an analysis of options to reduce the environmental pressure of the eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp in Thailand not all emissions need to be taken into account. We identified the emissions that are responsible for at least 85 % of the environmental pressure for each environmental theme. These emissions are :    CH 4, N 2 O, NO x, CO, VOC and particulates from biomass combustion, CO 2 and SO 2 from bunker oil used in lime combustion, SO 2, NO x and VOC from lime combustion, AOX, COD and TRS from pulp production, P from wastewater treatment, and N 2 O and PO 4 3 - from fertilizer use in eucalyptus plantation. Modeling options to reduce the environmental pressure The second research question is to identify options to reduce the environmental pressure caused by the Kraft pulp industry in Thailand and to analyze their technical reduction potentials and associated costs. To answer this question, the third and fourth steps of environmental systems analysis were carried out. These include system synthesis (model building) and system analysis (model exploration). An integrated environmental assessment model was built, combining partial life cycle analysis, multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and cost effectiveness analysis. We developed a model to quantify emissions from the Kraft pulp industry in Thailand and their potential environmental impacts. The model includes those sources and emissions that importantly contribute the potential environmental impact, as identified in the first phase of this study. The potential environmental impact of the emissions was calculated from the total amount emitted per time unit (year) and classification factors of the compounds reflecting their relative importance for specific environmental problems. With respect to the reduction options, the model can be used to evaluate the effect of reduction options on the environmental impact and their associated costs. The model covers options for reducing the environmental impact and takes into account the side effect of reduction options on environmental problems. Thirty six reduction options are identified and categorized into 14 independent groups. The reduction options can affect the activity levels and/or emission factors. Reduction potentials are determined with reference to the situation in which none of the options are applied (reference situation). In addition, the model is capable of evaluating the 'overall' environmental impact using of multi-criteria analysis (MCA), in which an overall evaluation is performed on the basis of different criteria. The 'Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) ', which is an MCA tool that enables the user to establish weights for selected criteria by means of a series of pair wise comparisons, was used to generate valuation factors for each environmental problem. The model was explored in a number of ways. First, the results of the model were compared with Thailand-based studies, and it   was found that the model is adequate for analyzing the environmental impact of the Kraft pulp industry in Thailand. Next, the reference case, in which we assume that no options to reduce the environmental impact of Kraft pulp industry are applied, was analyzed. It was found that acidification and eutrophication are the largest environmental problems caused by the Kraft pulp industry in Thailand, contributing by about one-third each to the overall environmental impact. Lime kilns, recovery boilers and pulp bleaching units are the most important sub-units contributing to the overall environmental impact. Finally, the reduction options were analyzed with respect to their effectiveness and cost effectiveness in reducing environmental problems. We found that the most effective options are associated with reducing the emissions of eutrophying and acidifying compounds. These options include options in group wastewater treatment, wastewater minimization, alternative digesting techniques, alternative bleaching techniques, sulfur dioxide control and odor control. The most cost-effective options are typically associated with structural changes, such as improving the pulp washing, increasing the dry solid content of black liquor and spillage control, which are more cost-effective than typical end-of-pipe technologies such as activated sludge and scrubbers. Some options were found to be paying options, which means that the annual saving from reducing activity levels and/or emissions is larger than the annual costs. These options include applying optimum doses of fertilizer, <b>extended</b> <b>delignification,</b> enzyme delignification, improve pulp washing, solar heating and O 2 enrichment kilns. The results of the analysis of the reference case may help decision makers in prioritizing environmental management, while the analyses of the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of individual reduction options may help in choosing reduction options that are in line with their preferred environmental strategies. Different environmental strategies will lead to different combinations of options. The model can be used to analyze the environmental consequences and the associated costs of such combinations. As such the model is highly relevant for decision makers. Scenario analysis The last research question is to investigate possible future trends in the environmental pressure caused by the eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry in Thailand. Possible changes in the environmental performance of the eucalyptus-based Kraft industry in Thailand are analyzed for a 20 year period (2000 - 2020) through scenario analysis. Seven scenarios were developed and analyzed, including a No Option scenario (NOP), a Business-As-Usual scenario (BAU) and five different Environment Policy scenarios (ENP), reflecting different strategies to reduce the environmental impact. These scenarios were analyzed with respect to their effectiveness in reducing the environmental pressure, and the associated costs. For each scenario, the overall environmental impact was calculated, and emissions were quantified for compounds that contribute to six environmental problems: global warming, acidification, eutrophication, smog, human toxicity and the production of waste. The results indicate that without currently applied reduction options the environmental impact would be twice as high as it currently is. For the BAU scenario, in which no additional pollution reduction options are assumed to be implemented, the overall environmental impact was calculated to increase between 2000 and 2020 by a factor of two. The five Environmental Policy scenarios (ENP) reflect different strategies to reduce the environmental impact. The results indicate that, in the case of the ENP-M (theoretical maximum potential) scenario, it is theoretically possible to reduce the overall environmental impact by almost 50 % relative to the BAU 2020 levels. This, however, may not be feasible because of the high costs involved. In the ENP-I (intermediate) scenario, for which cost-effectiveness is given a high priority, a 26 % reduction in the overall environmental impact was calculated relative to the BAU scenario at almost 25 % lower costs. This makes the ENP-I scenario the cheapest of the scenarios studied here. The other ENP scenarios reflect different policy preferences for solving environmental problems at the global (ENP-G), regional (ENP-R), and local (ENP-L) scale. The results for these scenarios indicate that 24 - 37 % reduction of the overall impact relative to the BAU scenario can be achieved. This reflects that reduction of the overall environmental impact by about one-third relative to BAU scenario can be achieved through strategies which have a different focus. However, it is important to note that the costs of options implemented in these scenarios are different (cost of ENP-L> ENP-R> ENP-G). Environmental systems analysis procedure Environmental systems analysis (ESA) was found to be a useful procedure to analyze the environmental pressure, identify options to reduce these pressures and evaluate their cost-effectiveness for the eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry in Thailand. It was applied in six steps: 1) problem definition; 2) system definition; 3) system synthesis; 4) system analysis; 5) scenario analysis; and 6) presentation of results and implications for decision making. We have learned that this step-wise approach is not necessarily linear. Iterations were found to be needed to meet the objectives of the study. Environmental indicators, life cycle assessment (LCA), multi-criteria analysis (MCA), cost-effectiveness analysis and scenario analysis, have been proved to be essential tools for the analysis in this thesis. First, environmental indicators and LCA were combined to define the system boundary and quantify the environmental pressure of eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry. Next, the model, used to quantify the potential environmental impact and evaluate the reduction option, was developed based on LCA, MCA and cost effectiveness approaches. Finally, scenario analysis appeared a powerful tool to analyze the possible future consequences of different strategies to reduce the potential environmental impact of the eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp industry in Thailand. Novel aspects of this study not only include a better understanding of eucalyptus-based Kraft pulp production in Thailand, but also an improved insight in the usefulness of systems analysis tools for evaluating environmental policies in Thailand. The application of environmental systems analysis is based on a unique combination of tools applied to a case in Thailand. This contributes to the further development of environmental systems analysis and increase the understanding to the applicability of environmental systems analysis tools...|$|E
