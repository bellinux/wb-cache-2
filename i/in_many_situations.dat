5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> to preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *-tu {{appears to have been}} remade into *-tī already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī (likewise first singular personal pronoun *ʔana became *ʔanī).|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its Yucca Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the Yucca Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E

In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow. Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used.|$|E

25|$|Approximately normal {{distributions}} occur <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations,</b> {{as explained}} by the central limit theorem.

25|$|Gladwell often {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of holism to unconscious intelligence, meaning that it considers the situation as a whole.

However, only when a situation is overwhelmingly determined by one or a few interacting factors is holism consistent with simple underlying signatures. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations,</b> holism and simple underlying signatures pull in different directions.|$|E

25|$|Umlaut or {{mutation}} is an assimilatory process {{acting on}} vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel {{of a different}} vowel backness. In the case of i-umlaut and ʀ-umlaut, this entails a fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of u-umlaut, this entails labialization of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> grammatically significant as {{a side effect of}} losing the Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes whose vowels created the umlaut allophones.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more recent}} paper, the {{appendix}} {{was found to have}} evolved at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six times. This suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations</b> and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} charge {{carriers}} are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron.

A cheaper method would be to use a stratified sample with urban and rural strata. The rural sample could be under-represented in the sample, but weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate.|$|E
25|$|A sound {{reinforcement}} {{system is}} the combination of microphones, signal processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers in enclosures all controlled by a mixing console that makes live or pre-recorded sounds louder and may also distribute those sounds to a larger or more distant audience. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>situations,</b> a sound reinforcement system {{is also used to}} enhance or alter the sound of the sources on the stage, typically by using electronic effects, such as reverb, as opposed to simply amplifying the sources unaltered.|$|E

Common light particles are often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d for deuteron, α representing an alpha particle or helium-4, β for beta particle or electron, γ for gamma photon, etc. The reaction above would be written as Li-6(d,α)α.|$|E
