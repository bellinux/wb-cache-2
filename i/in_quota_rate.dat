40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the presence of}} gender quotas effect public perceptions of female legislators in regards to their competence and qualifications needed to enter public office. This paper suggests that gender quotas can promote negative public perceptions due to pre-established gender norms and meritocracy violations similarly to sentiments in Affirmative Action programs. Analyzing the survey data taken from participants in Argentina, the results suggests that perceptions of female legislators are impacted by the individual’s knowledge of what a gender quota is {{as well as the}} specifics of how Argentine gender quotas are executed. Of the total percentage of participants who took the survey, only a fraction was well versed in the details of gender <b>quotas</b> <b>in</b> their own country. Female participants whom were more versed <b>in</b> gender <b>quotas</b> <b>rated</b> female legislators more favorably within the scenario without gender quotas than with gender quotas. One unexpected result was that difference in average perceptions by sex, with only slight differences of male participants between the scenario with gender quotas and without, compared to a large difference of female participants between the two scenarios. Overall, the results of this paper demonstrate that gender quotas can have negative impacts on the public perceptions of female legislators...|$|R

This study addresses several important negotiations, using {{the agricultural sector}} model CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact Analysis), to analyze liberalization scenarios between the European Union and the Mercosur countries focusing particularly on their impacts in Brazil. Four possible agreements between Europe and Mercosur are simulated, including a broader multilateral agreement proposed in the G 20. The results suggest that a bilateral scenario involving larger tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quota</b> increase, as called for by Mercosur, generates larger gains than accepting the European Union proposal of 2004 or further multilateral trade liberalization based on the G 20 proposal. However, much larger increases <b>in</b> tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas</b> for all products are not necessarily justified in all cases. Moreover, Brazil's production and export potential is limited by factors other than trade restrictions. Copyright (c) 2009 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} the current Doha Round of the WTO {{negotiations}} on agriculture will require substantial reform {{in each of the}} three areas of market access, export subsidies and domestic support. Substantial improvement in market access for agricultural products will be an essential requirement for achieving a successful outcome.

Simulated scenarios include linear reductions in applied tariffs and expansions <b>in</b> tariff <b>rate</b> <b>quotas,</b> which are contrasted with a scenario representing market access proposals of the Cairns Group of countries in the current WTO agricultural negotiations. The effects of these two trade liberalisation scenarios on world prices and trade are analysed and discussed.

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of supply management in Canada during the 1970 s, milk production quota {{has been used to}} regulate output and participation in the dairy industry. In recent years, milk quota values have increased dramatically, almost tripling in value since the mid- 1980 s. This led to the Dairy Farmers of Ontario intervening on the milk production quota exchange on two occasions: first, in November 2006 with a progressive transfer assessment and then in July 2009, replacing the former policy with a firm price ceiling – fixing the unit price of quota at $ 25, 000. These policies represent a significant redistribution of economic benefits within the Ontario dairy community from milk producers approaching retirement and selling their quota to those remaining in the industry. The objective {{of this study is to}} first explore the reasons for the increase <b>in</b> production <b>quota</b> values; and second, to assess the welfare and distributional effects of each of the two quota policy schemes. Our results suggest that the increase <b>in</b> <b>quota</b> values were driven by basic economic factors expected to influence asset values and that the efficiency losses from intervention <b>in</b> the <b>quota</b> exchange are non-trivial.

40|$|Research PaperThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to model and measure shadow prices for quota that are not only vessel-specific but also conditioned upon the fisher's own quota holdings and individual circumstances regarding fishing effort. Shadow prices reflect the scarcity value of quota to each particular fisher and can be used to determine the maximum amount that each fisher {{would be willing to pay}} in order to purchase a one unit increase <b>in</b> <b>quota.</b> The fishery of interest is the Canadian Scotia-Fundy mobile gear fishery. Individual transferable vessel quotas were introduced for the 1991 fishing season for the three main species: cod, haddock and pollock. Using individual vessel data a restricted normalized quadratic profit function is used in estimation. The quadratic form is used here because of the ease of imposing regularity conditions. The model is specified imposing no restrictions on economies of scale but using an instrumental variable technique to account for possible correlation of fixed output levels with the residuals prior to 1991. Vessels are assumed to minimise the cost of harvesting quota regulated species and maximise profits over unregulated landings. The shadow value is measured as the value to the vessel of an increase <b>in</b> <b>quota</b> holdings. This includes a change in non-quota restricted profit caused by an increase in marginal cost from a one unit increase <b>in</b> <b>quota</b> landings, and a change in restricted profit due to the substitute/complementary relationship between non-quota and quota landings. The shadow value to the vessel is the price of quota fish minus the change in restricted profit. Changing regulatory polices will impact the value that fishers place on quota and knowledge of this value will allow regulators to identify types of transactions that might take place. Because shadow values are conditioned upon other quota holdings, fishery managers can influence the value fishers place on <b>quota</b> by changes <b>in</b> other <b>quota</b> holdings...|$|R
