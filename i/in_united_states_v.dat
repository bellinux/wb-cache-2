5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, the Court {{held that the}} offense of counterfeiting was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment. And, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Rosenburgh (1868) and United States v. Avery (1871), the Court {{held that a}} motion to quash an indictment could not be so certified, even if the motion called into question {{the jurisdiction of the}} circuit court.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E

5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except {{insofar as it}} required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction. More held that Congress's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power under the Exceptions Clause, eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted.|$|E

5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In Grady v.

5|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{taxability}} of compensation for personal services, whether called wages, salary, {{or some other}} term, may be either constitutional arguments as <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Connor (see below) or statutory arguments as in Cheek v.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> More (1805), the Court {{held that}} the {{ordinary}} means of appeal, the writ of error, could not be utilized in criminal cases from the circuit courts. This contributed {{to the importance of}} the certificate of division in criminal cases. The Marshall Court (18011835) heard thirty-one criminal cases arising from certificates of division; the Taney Court (1836–1864), fifteen; the Chase Court (1864–1873), seventeen; the Waite Court (18741888), thirty-eight; and the Fuller Court (18881910), fourteen.|$|E

The 1866, 1874, 1898, 1909, 1933, 1935, and 1940 re-enactments of the assimilative crimes offense explicitly incorporated this interpretation of Paul.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Shackleford (1855), the Court {{held that}} the section 30's {{allocation}} of peremptory challenges controlled, rather than an 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no peremptory challenges in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Simms (1803), the Court heard a writ of error, {{brought by}} the United States, on the merits from a {{criminal}} case in the D.C. circuit court.

25|$|The Boomers planned excursions, {{which they}} called raids, {{into the area}} and {{surveyed}} townsites, built homes, and planted crops.

Finally, <b>in</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>vs.</b> Payne <b>in</b> 1884, the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> District Court at Topeka, Kansas ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was not a criminal offense.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{compared}} the associations of individual mental health disorders, self-rated mental health, disability, and perceived need for care {{with the use}} of outpatient mental health services <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and the Canadian province of Ontario. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed. Data came from the 1990 US National Comorbidity Survey and the 1990 Mental Health Supplement to the Ontario Health Survey. RESULTS: The odds of receiving any medical or psychiatric specialty services were as follows: for persons with any affective disorder, 3. 1 <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>vs</b> 11. 0 <b>in</b> Ontario; for persons with fair or poor self-rated mental health, 2. 7 <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>vs</b> 5. 0 <b>in</b> Ontario; for persons with mental health-related disability. 3. 0 <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>vs</b> 1. 5 <b>in</b> Ontario. When perceived need was controlled for, most of the between country differences in use disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The higher use of mental health services <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> than <b>in</b> Ontario is mostly explained by the combination of a higher prevalence of mental morbidity and a higher prevalence of perceived need for care among persons with low mental morbidity <b>in</b> the <b>United</b> <b>States...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> 1979 the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Federal Government {{went after}} Sonny Barger and several members and {{associates}} of the Oakland charter of the Hells Angels using RICO. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>vs.</b> Barger, the prosecution team attempted {{to demonstrate a}} pattern of behavior to convict Barger {{and other members of}} the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a hung jury on the predicate acts: [...] "There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns." ...|$|R
5|$|Section 32 {{provided}} for the following statutes of limitations: no statute of limitations for wilfull murder or forgery; no statute of limitations for fugitives from justice; three (3) years for capital offenses (other than wilfull murder and forgery); two (2) years for non-capital offenses. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Cook (1872), the Court held that indictments need not plead facts establishing that these limitations periods have not run.|$|E
5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. <b>In</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>v.</b> Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.|$|E
