During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the Ministry of Defence in 1982 during the Falklands War, and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the Royal Marines.

On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E

Unfortunately, <b>direct</b> care <b>staff</b> performance is often underwhelming, particularly as it pertains to engaging in pleasant interactions with residents. <b>Direct</b> care <b>staff</b> performance is particularly concerning when considering that one of the strongest protective factors for youth facing adversity is a strong attachment to adults.

Additionally, social validity measures were collected from <b>direct</b> care <b>staff</b> and teachers in classrooms, which indicated acceptability of the intervention.

40|$|Background and aim To explain <b>direct</b> care <b>staff's</b> attitudes (responsive or rejecting) towards {{aggression}} {{of clients}} with intellectual disability (ID), {{data were collected}} about client characteristics {{as well as individual}} and team characteristics of 475 <b>direct</b> care <b>staff</b> members, working in 71 teams. Method and results Multilevel analyses revealed that a positive team climate was positively associated with both a rejecting and responsive attitude towards aggression. Senior staff members and females showed a less responsive attitude towards aggression, whereas a relatively high percentage of females in a team and a positive attitude towards external professionals were associated with a more responsive attitude towards aggression. Unexpectedly, staff who experienced less verbal and/or physical aggressive incidents of their clients with ID showed a more rejecting attitude towards aggression. Finally, characteristics of the clients with ID accounted for the largest part {{of the variance in the}} attitude towards aggression of <b>direct</b> care <b>staff,</b> in particular psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions and implications Further research is necessary in order to understand how team processes affect the attitude towards aggression of <b>direct</b> care <b>staff.</b> Further it is recommended to provide <b>direct</b> care <b>staff</b> with knowledge about mental disorders in clients with ID...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{specific}} role of burnout {{as a mediator}} {{in the relationship between}} psychological capital and psychological well-being (PWB) in <b>direct</b> support <b>staff</b> of specialist autism services. A time lagged design with three data-collection points was conducted to survey 56 professionals (<b>direct</b> support <b>staff)</b> who work at a Spanish center specialized in autism. Participants completed measures of psychological capital, burnout and PWB. The hypothesized model was tested using structural equation modeling. Our findings show that psychological capital has a significant main effect on PWB. The results also show that psychological capital in the work environment should result in lower burnout which in turn, should lead to higher degrees of PWB in the <b>direct</b> support <b>staff</b> of autism services. Our results support that psychological capital is a key variable in the working life of the <b>direct</b> support <b>staff</b> of autism services. The findings suggest the need of implementing programmes which strengthen each individual's psychological capital in order to prevent burnout and achieve a greater PWB...|$|R
