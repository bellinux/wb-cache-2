The birefringence of a solution sandwiched between two concentric cylinders is measured {{as a function of}} the difference in rotational speed between the inner and outer cylinders. The flow tends to orient an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particle</b> (typically, a protein, virus, etc.) in one direction, whereas rotational diffusion (tumbling) causes the molecule to become disoriented. The equilibrium between these two processes {{as a function of the}} flow provides a measure of the axial ratio of the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|E

Uniform of direction is attained only by applying a field, or by choosing as a specimen, a body which is itself of microscopic dimensions (a fine particle). The size range for which a ferromagnet become single-domain is generally quite narrow and a first quantitative result in this direction is due to William Fuller Brown, Jr. who, in his fundamental paper, rigorously proved (in the framework of Micromagnetics), though in the special case of a homogeneous sphere of radius , what nowadays is known as Brown’s fundamental theorem of the theory of fine ferromagnetic particles. This theorem states the existence of a critical radius [...] such that the state of lowest free energy is one of uniform magnetization if [...] (i.e. the existence of a critical size under which spherical ferromagnetic particles stay uniformly magnetized in zero applied field). A lower bound for [...] can then be computed. In 1988, Amikam A. Aharoni, by using the same mathematical reasoning as Brown, was able to extend the Fundamental Theorem to the case of a prolate spheroid. Recently, Brown’s fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles has been rigorously extended to the case of a general ellipsoid, and an estimate for the critical diameter (under which the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particle</b> become single domain) has been given in terms of the demagnetizing factors of the general ellipsoid.

The preponderance of preview work has focused on the microstructural model by the random packing of spherical or two-dimensional elliptical particles, and little is known about three-dimensional <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles.</b> In the present work, a new random packing model of three-dimensional <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> was developed to simulate microstructure of cement-based materials.

40|$|Micron-sized {{anisotropic}} particles with homogeneous {{surface properties}} at a fluid interface can deform the interface {{due to their}} shape. The particles thereby create excess interfacial area and interact {{in order to minimize}} this area, which lowers the total interfacial energy. We present a systematic investigation of the interface deformations around single <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> and cuboidal particles with rounded edges in the near field for various contact angles and particle aspect ratios. The correlation of these deformations with capillary bond energies—the interaction energies of two particles at contact—quantifies the relation between the interactions and the near-field deformations. We characterize the interactions using effective power laws and investigate how anisotropic particles self-assemble by capillary forces. Interface deformations and particle interactions for cuboidal particles are weaker compared with those for <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> with the same aspect ratios. For both particle shapes, the bound state in side-by-side orientation is most stable, while the interaction in tip-to-side orientation is repulsive. Furthermore, we find capillary attraction between spherical and <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles.</b> Our calculations therefore suggest cluster formation of spherical and <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles,</b> which elucidates the role of spherical particles as stoppers for the growth of worm-like chains of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles.</b> The interaction between spherical and <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> might also explain the suppression of the “coffee-ring effect” that has been observed for evaporating droplets with mixtures of spherical and <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles.</b> In general, our calculations of the near-field interactions complement previous calculations in the far field and help to predict colloidal assembly and rheological properties of particle-laden interfaces...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of static packings of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> in 2 D and 3 D over {{a range of}} aspect ratio and compression Δϕ. While amorphous packings of spherical particles at jamming onset (Δϕ= 0) are isostatic and possess the minimum contact number z_ iso required {{for them to be}} collectively jammed, amorphous packings of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> generally possess fewer contacts than expected for collective jamming (z < z_ iso) from naive counting arguments, which assume that all contacts give rise to linearly independent constraints on interparticle separations. To understand this behavior, we decompose the dynamical matrix M=H-S for static packings of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> into two important components: the stiffness H and stress S matrices. We find that the stiffness matrix possesses N(z_ iso - z) eigenmodes ê_ 0 with zero eigenvalues even at finite compression, where N is the number of particles. In addition, these modes ê_ 0 are nearly eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix with eigenvalues that scale as Δϕ, and thus finite compression stabilizes packings of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles.</b> At jamming onset, the harmonic response of static packings of <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> vanishes, and the total potential energy scales as δ^ 4 for perturbations by amplitude δ along these `quartic' modes, ê_ 0.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of turbulence modulation effects by Taylor-scale size {{particles in the}} dilute regime. Experiments are performed on a turbulence tank able to provide Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence at Reλ ≈ 270. A novel experimental technique capable of simultaneously measuring rotational rates of arbitrarily shaped particles and fluid velocity using standard Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (Stereo-PIV) and Index-of-Refracion matching is presented here. Particles of the same IoR of water with embedded tracers allowed the measurement of the velocity of the portion of particles in the measurement plane. A novel algorithm {{based on the assumption}} of solid body rotation, is then used to extract particle rotation rates. We compare the results from two particle shapes to the single phase measurements: spherical and <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> with aspect ratio 2. It is found that spherical particles provide a 15 % turbulence reduction, about five times more than what is provided by <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>particles</b> at the same volume fraction (φv ≈ 0. 1 %), and with less particle surface area available.
