25|$|About 10 {{million years}} ago the region began to be uplifted. It has been lifted about 7000 feet (2100 m) and is {{continuing}} at about 2 millimetres per year, which {{is greater than the}} rate of <b>denudation.</b> The cause of the uplift is unknown, but geologists theorize that it is caused by a hot spot in the earth's crust. The occurrence of earthquake swarms {{near the center of the}} massif at Blue Mountain Lake may be evidence of this. Some of the earthquakes have exceeded 5 on the Richter magnitude scale.|$|E
25|$|About 1833, through meeting Adam Sedgwick at Barmouth {{and joining}} him in several excursions, Hopkins became {{intensely}} interested in geology. From then on, in papers {{published by the}} Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Geological Society of London, he defined the discipline of physical geology, making mathematical investigations dealing with the effects that an elevatory force, acting from below, would produce on {{a portion of the}} Earth's crust, in fissures and faults. In this way he discussed the elevation and <b>denudation</b> of the Lake District, the Wealden area, and the Bas Boulonnais.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} types of rock that are {{formed by the}} {{deposition}} and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water. Sedimentation is the collective name for processes that cause mineral or organic particles (detritus) to settle in place. The particles that form a sedimentary rock by accumulating are called sediment. Before being deposited, the sediment was formed by weathering and erosion from the source area, and then transported {{to the place of}} deposition by water, wind, ice, mass movement or glaciers, which are called agents of <b>denudation.</b> Sedimentation may also occur as minerals precipitate from water solution or shells of aquatic creatures settle out of suspension.|$|E
25|$|In the Mesozoic era {{the whole}} of the worn-down plateau was under sea. In this {{expansive}} shallow sea, which covered most of Assam (India) and Bhutan, chalk deposits formed from seawater tides oscillating between land and sea levels. During subsequent periods, tertiary rocks were laid down. The Paro metamorphic belt may be found overlying Chasilakha-Soraya gneiss in some places. Silurian metamorphics in other places suggest long <b>denudation</b> of the surface. This was the time of Alpine mountain formation, and much of the movement in the palaeozoic region was probably connected with it. The Chomolhari tourmaline granites of Bhutan, stretching westwards from the Paro chu and ats much depth below the present surface, were formed during this period of uplift, fracture and subsidence.|$|E
25|$|Subsection 3 {{reveals an}} {{abandonment}} of the cleared areas, the decline of Olea, {{and the spread of}} Pistacia, Pinus brutia and Quercus coccifera (instead of deciduous oak) on formerly cleared land and in the maquis. As {{this is the time of}} the rise of Ionia, the palynological scenario suggests a movement of population from the land to the newly settled or expanded big cities of the Ionian League. Subsection 4 and Baf S6 go on to catalogue the return of the fruit trees, re-clearing the land for pasture, planting of rye and other cereals, ultimate destabilization of the soil through over-use, <b>denudation</b> and acceleration of sedimentation. After the sealing off of the bay to form the lake, population and land use declined to their current low levels around Latmus, but the river valley is cultivated.|$|E
25|$|The Buxa {{range of}} Indo-Bhutan {{is also a}} part of the ancient rocks of the Himalayas. The ancient folds, running mainly along an east-west axis, were worn down during a long period of <b>denudation</b> lasting into {{cretaceous}} times, possibly over a hundred million years. During this time the carboniferous and permian rocks disappeared from the surface, except in its north near Hatisar in Bhutan and in the long trench extending from Jaldhaka River to Torsa River, where limestone and coal deposits are preserved in discontinuous basins. Limestone deposits also appear in Bhutan on the southern flanks of the Lower Himalayas. The rocks of the highlands are mainly sandstones of the Devonian age, with limestones and shales of the same period in places. The core of the mountain is exposed across the center, where Paleozoic rocks, mainly Cambrian and Silurian slates and Takhstasang gneiss outcrops are visible in the northwest and northeast, the latter extending to western Arunachal Pradesh in India.|$|E
500|$|A {{desert is}} a barren area of {{landscape}} where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for {{plant and animal}} life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of <b>denudation.</b> About {{one third of the}} land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or [...] "cold deserts". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.|$|E
2500|$|The Lesser Kuril Ridge (...) [...] This {{sector is}} two very small islands ("Shards" [...] and [...] "Demin"). It is {{characterized}} by the presence of small areas and the height of the islands with signs of considerable <b>denudation,</b> which are a continuation of the peninsula geomorphological Nemuro (a. Hokkaido).|$|E
2500|$|During the PETM, sediments are enriched with {{kaolinite}} from a detrital source due to [...] <b>denudation</b> (initial {{processes such as}} volcanoes, earthquakes, and plate tectonics). This suggests increased precipitation, {{and enhanced}} erosion of older kaolinite-rich soils and sediments. Increased weathering from the enhanced runoff formed thick paleosoil enriched with carbonate nodules (Microcodium like), and this suggests a semi-arid climate.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{more recent}} date (probably Tertiary) are some igneous rocks, rich in alkalis, {{occurring}} in certain localities in southern Ethiopia. Of still more recent date are the basalts and ashes west of Massawa and around Annesley Bay and {{known as the}} Aden Volcanic Series. With regard to the older igneous rocks, the enormous amount they have suffered from <b>denudation</b> is a prominent feature.

2500|$|On 20 November, Darwin told Lyell of his {{revisions}} {{for a third}} {{edition of}} the Origin, including removing his estimate {{of the time it}} took for the Weald to erode: [...] "The confounded Wealden calculation, to be struck out. & a note to be inserted to effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from Review in Saturday R. & from Phillips, as I see in Table of Contents that he attacks it." [...] He later told Lyell that [...] "Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you", and advised caution: [...] "for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant." [...] The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated [...] "The computation of time required for the <b>denudation</b> of the Weald omitted. I have been convinced of its inaccuracy in several respects by an excellent article in the 'Saturday Review,' Dec. 24, 1859." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Menelaion is {{a shrine}} {{associated}} with Menelaus, located east of Sparta, {{by the river}} Eurotas, on the hill Profitis Ilias (Coordinates: [...] ). Built early 8th century BC it was believed by Spartans to be the home of Menelaus. In 1970 the British School in Athens started excavations {{in an attempt to}} locate Mycenaean remains in the area around Menelaion. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to Helen and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire, and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of Menelaus himself. Excavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around Menelaion {{in the southern part of}} the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia. The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north. Its area was approximately equal to that of the [...] "newer" [...] Sparta, but <b>denudation</b> has wreaked havoc with its buildings and nothing is left save ruined foundations and broken potsherds.|$|E
2500|$|The four-million-year-old Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a north-south {{trending}} zone of volcanoes and {{volcanic rock}} in the southern Coast Mountains of southwestern British Columbia, can be grouped into at least three enechelon segments, {{referred to as the}} northern, central, and southern segments. The northern segment overlaps the older Pemberton Volcanic Belt at a low angle near Mount Meager where Garibaldi Belt lavas rest on uplifted and deeply eroded remnants of Pemberton Belt subvolcanic intrusions and combines to form a single belt. A few isolated volcanoes northwest of Mount Meager, such as Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano, are also grouped as part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. However, their tectonic origins are largely unexplained and are a matter of going research. When the Farallon Plate ruptured to create the Nootka Fault between five and seven million years ago, there were some apparent changes along the Cascadia subduction zone. At issue is the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but based on rock composition is for Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano to be subduction related. The roughly circular, [...] wide, deeply dissected Silverthrone Caldera in the northern segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, was formed one million years ago during the Early Pleistocene period. The bulk of the volcano was erupted 0.4million years ago, but younger phases, consisting of lava flows and subsidiary volcanoes with compositions of andesite and basaltic andesite are also present. Mount Silverthrone, an eroded lava dome on the northeast edge of Silverthrone Caldera, was episodically active during both Pemberton and Garibaldi stages of volcanism. The eroded Franklin Glacier Volcano just to the southeast consists of dacite and andesite rocks that range in age from 3.9to 2.2million years old. Southeast of Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Bridge River Cones comprise remnants of both andesitic and alkali basalt cones and lava flows. These range in age from about one million years old to 0.5million years old and commonly display ice-contact features related to subglacial eruptions. Mount Meager, the most persistent volcano in the northern portion of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, is a complex of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes made of dacite and rhyodacite that become progressively younger from south to north, ranging in age from two million to 2,490years old. The central segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is defined by a group of eight volcanoes on a ridge of highland east of the Squamish River, and by remnants of basaltic lava flows preserved in the adjacent Squamish valley. Mount Cayley, the largest and most persistent volcano, is a deeply eroded stratovolcano comprising a lava dome complex made of dacite and minor rhyodacite ranging in age from 3.8to 0.31million years old. Mount Fee, a narrow volcanic plug made of rhyodacite about [...] long and [...] wide, rises [...] above the highland ridge. Complete <b>denudation</b> of the central spine as well as the absence of till under lava flows from Mount Fee suggest a preglacial age. The other volcanoes of the central Garibaldi Belt, including Ember Ridge, Pali Dome, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Brew and Crucible Dome, were formed during subglacial eruptions to develop tuya-like forms with over-steepened, ice-contact margins. The primary volcanoes in the southern segment are Mount Garibaldi, Mount Price, and The Black Tusk. The oldest volcano, The Black Tusk, is the remnants of an extinct andesitic stratovolcano that formed during two distant stages of volcanic activity, the first between 1.1 and 1.3 million years ago and the second between 0.17 and 0.21 million years ago. Mount Garibaldi, a fairly dissected stratovolcano [...] north of Vancouver, was built by PelÃ©an eruptions between 0.26and 0.22million years ago during the waning stages of the last glacial, or [...] "Wisconsinian", period. Mount Price, a less significant stratovolcano just north of Mount Garibaldi, formed during three distinct periods of volcanic activity beginning at 1.2million years ago and culminating with the eruption of Clinker Peak on its western flank 0.3million years ago. In addition to the large, central andesite-dacite volcanoes, the southern portion of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt includes remnants of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. These include valley -filling lava flows interbedded with till containing wood about 34,000years old.|$|E

6000|$|... [98] Dr. Croll and Sir Archibald Geikie {{have shown}} that marine <b>denudation</b> is very small in amount as {{compared}} with sub-aÃ«rial, since it acts only locally {{on the edge of}} the land, whereas the latter acts over every foot of the surface. Mr. W. T. Blanford argues that the difference is still greater in tropical than in temperate latitudes, and arrives at the conclusion that--"If over British India the effects of marine to those of fresh-water <b>denudation</b> in removing the rocks of the country be estimated at 1 to 100, I believe that the result of marine action will be greatly overstated" [...] (Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia, p. 158, note). Now, as our estimate of the rate of sub-aÃ«rial <b>denudation</b> cannot pretend to any precise accuracy, we are justified in neglecting marine <b>denudation</b> altogether, especially as we have no method of estimating it for the whole earth with any approach to correctness.|$|E

6000|$|... [88] These {{figures are}} merely {{used to give}} {{an idea of the}} rate at which <b>denudation</b> is {{actually}} going on now; but if no elevatory forces were at work, the rate of <b>denudation</b> would certainly diminish as the mountains were lowered and the slope of the ground everywhere rendered flatter. This would follow not only from the diminished power of rain and rivers, but because the climate would become more uniform, the rainfall probably less, and no rocky peaks would be left to be fractured and broken up by the action of frosts. It is certain, however, that no continent has ever remained long subject to the influences of <b>denudation</b> alone, for, as we have seen in our sixth chapter, elevation and depression have always been going on in one part or other of the surface.|$|E
60|$|Effects of <b>Denudation</b> in Destroying the Evidence of Remote Glacial Epochs.--It may be supposed, that if earlier glacial epochs {{than the}} last did really occur, we ought to meet with some {{evidence}} of the fact corresponding to that which has satisfied us of the extensive recent glaciation of the northern hemisphere; but Dr. Croll and other writers have ably argued that no such evidence {{is likely to be}} found. It is now generally admitted that sub-aÃ«rial <b>denudation</b> is a much more powerful agent in lowering and modifying the surface of a country than was formerly supposed. It has in fact been proved to be so powerful that the difficulty now felt is, not to account for the <b>denudation</b> which can be proved to have occurred, but to explain the apparent persistence of superficial features which ought long ago to have been destroyed.|$|E

60|$|Geological Changes as Aiding Migration.--It {{will be well}} also {{to notice}} here, that there is another aid to {{dispersion}} dependent upon the changes effected by <b>denudation</b> during the long periods included in {{the duration of the}} species and genera of plants. A considerable number of {520} the plants of the Miocene period of Europe were so much like existing species that although they have generally received fresh names they may well have been identical; and {{a large proportion of the}} vegetation during the whole Tertiary period consisted of genera which are still living.[141] But from what is now known of the rate of sub-aÃ«rial <b>denudation,</b> we are sure, that during each division of this period many mountain chains must have been considerably lowered, while we know that some of the existing ranges have been greatly elevated. Ancient volcanoes, too, have been destroyed by <b>denudation,</b> and new ones have been built up, so that we may be quite sure that ample means for the transmission of temperate plants across the tropics, may have existed in countries where they are now no longer to be found. The great mountain masses of Guiana and Brazil, for example, must have been far more lofty before the sedimentary covering was denuded from their granitic bosses and metamorphic peaks, and may have aided the southern migration of plants before the final elevation of the Andes. And if Africa presents us with an example of a continent of vast antiquity, we may be sure that its great central plateaux once bore far loftier mountain ranges before they were reduced to their present condition by long ages of <b>denudation.</b>|$|E
60|$|To {{what extent}} <b>denudation</b> has thus lowered the peaks we dare {{scarcely}} form a conjecture; but considering {{the number and}} variety of the beds which in some places overlie the gneiss and granite, we may reasonably conclude that many thousand feet have been removed.|$|E
60|$|Here {{we see an}} intelligible {{relation}} between {{the character of the}} river basin and the amount of <b>denudation.</b> The Mississippi has a large portion of its basin in an arid country, and its sources are either in forest-clad plateaux or in mountains free from glaciers and with a scanty rainfall. The Danube flows through Eastern Europe where the rainfall is considerably less than in the west, while comparatively few of its tributaries rise among the loftiest Alps. The proportionate amounts of <b>denudation</b> being then what we might expect, and as all are probably under rather than over the truth, we may safely take the average of them all as representing an amount of <b>denudation</b> which, if not true for the whole land surface of the globe, will certainly be so for a very considerable proportion of it. This average is almost exactly one foot in three thousand years.[34] The mean altitude of the several {105} continents has been recently estimated by Mr. John Murray,[35] to be as follows: Europe 939 feet, Asia 3,189 feet, Africa 2020 feet, North America 1,888 feet, and South America 2,078 feet. At the rate of <b>denudation</b> above given, it results that, were no other forces at work, Europe would be planed down to the sea-level in about two million eight hundred thousand years; while if we take a somewhat slower rate for North America, that continent might last about four or five million years.[36] This also implies that the mean height of these continents would have been about double what it is now three million and five million years ago respectively: and as {{we have no reason to}} suppose this to have been the case, we are led to infer the constant action of that upheaving force which the presence of sedimentary formations even on the highest mountains also demonstrates.|$|E
6000|$|... [97] In {{his reply}} to Sir W. Thomson, Professor Huxley assumed {{one foot in}} a {{thousand}} years as a not improbable rate of deposition. The above estimate indicates a far higher rate; and this follows from the well-ascertained fact, that the area of deposition is many times smaller than the area of <b>denudation.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Now a {{coast line}} of 100,000 miles with a width of 30 gives {{an area of}} 3,000,000 square miles, on which the denuded matter of the whole land-area of 57,000,000 square {112} miles is deposited. As these two areas are as 1 to 19, it follows that deposition, as {{measured}} by maximum thickness, goes on at least nineteen {{times as fast as}} denudation--probably very much faster. But the mean rate of <b>denudation</b> over the whole earth is about one foot in three thousand years; therefore the rate of maximum deposition will be at least 19 feet in the same time; and as the total maximum thickness of all the stratified rocks of the globe is, according to Professor Haughton, 177,200 feet, the time required to produce this thickness of rock, at the present rate of <b>denudation</b> and deposition, is only 28,000,000 years.[43] ...|$|E

60|$|This view is self-evident, and has occurred, I believe, {{to almost}} every observer, at {{whatever}} {{part of the}} base of the Himalaya he may have studied this deposit. Its position, above the sandstones of the Sewalik range in the north-west Himalaya, and those of Sikkim, which appear to be modern fossiliferous rocks, indicates its being geologically of recent formation; but it still remains a subject of the utmost importance to discover the extent and nature of the ocean to whose agency it is referred. I have elsewhere remarked that the alluvium of the Gangetic valley may to a great degree be the measure of the <b>denudation</b> which the Himalaya has suffered along its Indian watershed. It was, no doubt, during the gradual rise of that chain from the ocean, that the gravel and alluvium were deposited; and in the terraces and alternation of these, there is evidence that there have been many subsidences and elevations of the coast-line, during which the gravel has suffered greatly from <b>denudation.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [86] It has {{usually been}} the {{practice}} {{to take the}} amount of <b>denudation</b> in the Mississippi valley, or one foot in six thousand years, {{as a measure of}} the rate of <b>denudation</b> in Europe, from an idea apparently of being on the [...] "safe side," [...] and of not over-estimating the rate of change. But this appears to me a most unphilosophical mode of proceeding and unworthy of scientific inquiry. What should we think of astronomers if they always took the lowest estimates of planetary or stellar distances, instead of the mean results of observation, [...] "in order {{to be on the safe}} side!"? As if error in one direction were any worse than error in another. Yet this is what geologists do systematically. Whenever any calculations are made involving the antiquity of man, it is those that give the lowest results that are always taken, for no reason apparently except that there was, for so long a time, a prejudice, both popular and scientific, against the great antiquity of man; and now that a means has been found of measuring the rate of <b>denudation,</b> they take the slowest rate instead of the mean rate, apparently only because there is now a scientific prejudice in favour of extremely slow geological change. I take the mean of the whole; and as this is almost exactly the same as the mean of the three great European rivers--the Rhone, Danube, and Po--I cannot believe that this will not be nearer the truth for Europe than taking one North American river as the standard.|$|E
60|$|But {{the amount}} of <b>denudation</b> which the strata have in many places suffered, {{independently}} of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. I remember having been much struck with the evidence of <b>denudation,</b> when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs {{of one or two}} thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is still more plainly told by faults,--those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{during the}} Tertiary period, {{another layer of}} London clay and other soft {{deposits}} was spread {{over the top of}} the chalk, certainly on the strip between the South Downs and the sea, and probably over the whole district between the Channel and the Thames valley: though in this case, later <b>denudation</b> has proceeded so far that very few traces of the Tertiary formations are preserved anywhere except in the greater hollows.|$|E
