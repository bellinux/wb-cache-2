40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the behaviour of an independent metering circuit architectures equipped with electro-hydraulic controlled multi-spools valves. The analysis is performed with reference to the hydraulic circuit and operating conditions usual of the auxiliary utilities of a mid-size power tractors. The increasing interest to reduce pollutant emissions drives the research to alternative solutions for the hydraulic circuit aimed to decrease power dissipation. From this point of view the independent metering architecture is a potentially energy saving system if compared with the traditional single spool valve architecture. This general feeling has however to be proved in the single application field because the amount of energy saved strongly depends on the kind of duty cycle involved in the analysis. For this work, a typical duty cycle for auxiliary utilities has been used, previously obtained through experimental measurement on a tractor equipped with a front loader. The duty cycle adopted involves two linear actuators, working togetherwith different loads and requiring different flows; this general condition cannot be considered favourable from the point of view of the energy saving potential of the new system but it highlights the fact that if there is an amount of energy saved in this condition, the investment need in time and costs is worth. The modelling is based on a lumped parameter approach and the independent metering valves are created developing a <b>distributor</b> <b>block</b> where any single metering element is modelled on the basis of the commercial EHPV Husco. Different control algorithms have been developed in C++ language to test different control strategy,evidencing the amount of energy saved with respect to the traditional architecture...|$|E

[...] for People Organized Working for Economic Rebirth. The initiative {{called for a}} joint enterprise of businesses and organizations, owned or run by black people, to produce and distribute a line of cosmetics and toiletries sold under the Clean & Fresh (now defunct) label. Major haircare companies, including Johnson Products Company, {{backed out of the}} initiative fearing it could lead to accusations of anti-Semitism. Johnson Products owner George E. Johnson, Sr. maintained that his company's distributors told him that any dealings with Farrakhan's P.O.W.E.R. project would lead to having his own products boycotted. [...] "We knew we could not offend our distribution channels," [...] a Johnson spokesman Dorothy McConner said. [...] "When I saw that," [...] Farrakhan said, [...] "I recognized that the Blackman will never be free until we address the relationship between Blacks and Jews." ...|$|R

At the age of 17, she had her novel published, l'Homme facile (Easy Man). The French government banned it for readers under 18 years old. A film {{based on the novel}} was made shortly after the publication of the book, but the producer went bankrupt and the <b>distributor</b> Artedis <b>blocked</b> any commercial release of the film for twenty years although it had been given an R rating.|$|R

Keene, in which a California State Senator wanted to distribute three films from Canada about acid rain and nuclear war, but felt his reputation would be harmed if he distributed films that had been classified officially as [...] "political propaganda". The Court backed up an earlier lower court ruling in favor {{of one of the}} film's <b>distributors</b> in <b>Block</b> v. Meese. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA), 2 U.S.C. § 1601, removed from the Act certain agents engaged in lobbying activities who register under that Act, which is administered by Congress.|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{that even}} the poorest picture would find an outlet, the studios could operate at full capacity. In the process, the majors shifted the risks of {{production}} financing to the independent exhibitor. The long-term effects of the policy also stifled competition by foreclosing the market to independent producers and <b>distributors.</b> In short, <b>block</b> booking allowed the majors to wrest {{the greatest amount of}} profits from the marketplace.Along with the blocks of features, exhibitors were required to take the major's shorts as well—a practice known as full-line forcing. The smaller Hollywood studios—known collectively as Poverty Row—didn't have the big pictures with A-list stars that would have allowed them to compel theater owners to directly block book. Instead, they mostly sold exclusive regional distribution rights to so-called states' rights firms. These distributors in turn marketed blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (given that the films' source was Poverty Row, a relatively minor star). In July 1938, the Justice Department's antitrust division filed a suit, United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. et al., charging the eight major Hollywood studios with violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, an Ethan Allen factory scaled-back {{operations}} and eventually closed. The building was vacant until being bought and rented out to various tenants: a trucking company, a vintage cars restorer, a children's toy <b>blocks</b> <b>distributor.</b> Also in the mid-80s, a long-standing factory building (the Melville Footwear facility) and its landmark tall brick smokestack were demolished {{and on the}} site a distribution center for the Marshalls company was built. The new facility and also expansion at the poultry-processing plant led to increased truck-traffic on Main Street and also to a built-up [...] "industrial" [...] feel to the town's northern end. A riveted iron water tower loomed over the downtown block; the silver-painted structure for decades bore a graffiti tag reading Big Al. A civil defense siren {{the size of a}} small car was attached to a leg of the tower; it was tested occasionally and also served (until the late '80s when pagers and then cell phones made it obsolete) as the volunteer firefighters' call to action. (The water tower was dismantled in the late 2000s.) In the late 1980s, the town's oldest houses (log structures including the historic tollgate-keeper's building) were demolished to build a gas station and a Hardee's. Later, more historic structures were bulldozed—including a Federal Period brick house felled to build a video store. Traffic load increased, and Bridgewater went from a one-stoplight town to having five.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Galanty {{assembled}} {{a committee of}} the VCA to locate a compromise design and material. Loffelstein, or Loffel Block, was identified by a VCA committee member Andy Shores as possibly meeting those goals. It allowed plants to grow inside the material, could be placed on a slope to allow birds and wildlife {{to climb out of}} the canals, was safe for small children as it allowed them {{to hold on to the}} sides, and or climb out of the Canals, was lower cost project over the Armorflex design, and was aesthetically pleasing to the property owners. Mark Galanty recruited canal resident architects to create a design board with the Loffel Block material, and Galanty publicly presented the Loffel design Plan at a public meeting with Councilwoman Galanter in attendance. Galanter stated she would be open to the Venice Canals Association design material. Mark Galanty got the Loffel <b>Block</b> <b>distributor</b> in Orange County to install a test site across from the Armorflex test site at the distributors cost. The test was successful with plants growing in the blocks, wildlife and ducks able to climb up the material, and the majority of the property owners supporting this design. Galanter agreed to have city engineers design an official city plan using the Loffel Block. Luis Ganajas revised the plans to include the material Loffel Block at 55 degree slop. VCA members Robert Trask and Mark Galanty took the city design, an actual Loffel Block, and the community support poll showing overwhelming support to different Venice groups, city government agencies, state agencies, environmental groups, historical groups, and each property owner on the canals getting support for what was termed [...] "The Compromise Plan". Eventually, letters of support for the Loffel plan were presented to the city from the Sierra Club, Heal the Bay, the local state senator and state assemblyman, both U.S. senators, and the local county supervisor. Based on the support of the Loffel Block design over the Armorflex design, Councilwoman Galanter had Public Works drop the Armorflex plan and focusd on the Loffel Block plan.|$|R
