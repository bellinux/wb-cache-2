50|$|Malmö FF {{qualified}} for the 2014 Svenska Supercupen by winning the 2014 Allsvenskan on 5 October 2014. The match was played at home at Malmö Stadion on 9 November 2014 and the club's opponents were the 2013-14 Svenska Cupen winners IF Elfsborg. This was the second successive and third time in total that the club competed in Svenska Supercupen. Malmö FF won their second successive title after winning 5-4 on penalties after the match had ended 2-2 after extra time. Isaac Kiese Thelin scored Malmö FF's first goal in the 89th minute of ordinary time, equalizing Elfsborg's 1-0 lead.

However Rory McArdle headed in a cross {{to make sure the}} Bantams got a point from the match. The Bantams first home game was a 4-0 win against Carlisle United, Bradford raced into a 3-0 lead after half an hour with Mark Yeates scoring a spectacular goal followed by goals from Nahki Wells and James Hanson before Gary Jones added a second half goal. Bradford's first loss of the season came against Port Vale as the Bantams went down 2-1, their only goal coming from in form striker Nahki Wells. Bradford bounced back from this defeat with an outstanding 2-0 win over Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United with Wells scoring both of the Bantams goals. Bradford's last game of September was a 1-1 draw with Stevenage, the Bantams trailed earlier on due to a penalty but just after halftime Kyel Reid scored to <b>equalize</b> <b>to</b> ensure Bradford came away with a point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the blind multichannel dereverberation {{problem for a}} single source. We have shown before [5] that the single-input multi-output (SIMO) reverberation filter can be equalized blindly by applying MIMO Linear Prediction (LP) to its output (after SISO input pre-whitening). In this paper, we investigate the LP-based dereverberation in a noisy environment, and/or under acoustic channel length underestimation. Consid-ering ambient noise and late reverberation as additive noises, we propose to introduce a postfilter that transforms the MIMO prediction filter into a somewhat longer equalizer. The postfilter allows to <b>equalize</b> <b>to</b> non-zero delay. Both MMSE-ZF and MMSE design criteria are considered here for the postfilter. We also focus here on computationally efficient (FFT based) block Toeplitz covariance matrix enhancement that enforces the SIMO filtered source plus white noise structure before applying MIMO LP. A second suggested refinement is an iterative refinement between SISO and MIMO LP. Simulations show that the proposed scheme is robust in noisy environments, and performs better compared to the classic Delay-&-Predict equalizer and the Delay-&-Sum beamformer. I...|$|E

40|$|Background: The cuff of the {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) is preferred to be partially inflated before insertion in pediatric cases. However, {{it is not}} known how much inflation is appropriate. In addition, intra-cuff pressure is not routinely monitored in many institutions despite the fact that a neglected high cuff pressure could cause several complications. This study was conducted to determine whether the cuff inflated with its resting volume before insertion could have a clinically tolerable intra-cuff pressure after insertion. Methods: One hundred fifty unpremedicated children aged 0 to 9 yrs were enrolled. The pilot balloon valve was connected to a piston-free syringe to keep the valve open to the atmosphere and allowing the pressure within the cuff of to LMA to <b>equalize</b> <b>to</b> atmospheric pressure. Anesthesia was induced with 6 vol % of sevoflurane in oxygen. After insertion and final positioning of the LMA, the intra-cuff pressure was measured using a cuff pressure manometer. Results: The mean intra-cuff pressure was 50 ± 12. 9 cmH 2 O; intra-cuff pressures were 39. 1 ± 9. 3, 51. 6 ± 11. 2, and 64. 6 ± 12. 5 cmH 2 O for LMAs of sizes 1. 5, 2, and 2. 5, respectively. Intra-cuff pressure of more than 60 cmH 2 O was measured in 26 patients, and the median value was 70 cmH 2 O. There was weak statistical correlation among age, height, and weight with intra-cuff pressure. Conclusions: The cuff inflated by the resting volume before insertion may be a simple method for guaranteeing tolerable cuff pressure after insertion.

40|$|Geopressured {{reservoirs}} contain {{three types}} of energy: thermal, hydraulic, and methane gas. The thermal energy generally {{is a function of}} depth of burial. It can be converted to electricity using the binary or flash power plant cycle, the flash technology being commercial only if the fluid temperature exceeds about 340 F. The hydraulic energy can be converted to electrical power using a hydraulic turbine. The dissolved gas can be separated and either used to produce electricity using a gas turbine or sold commercially. These reservoirs occur in many states in the USA, including California. An overburden pressure is caused by the combined weight of the formation rock and the fluids (water/gas/oil) present in the pore spaces overlying the formation of interest. The overburden pressure, in general, increases relatively uniformly with depth, whereas the hydrostatic gradient is mainly a function of two variables: the dissolved solids concentration and the temperature gradient. The hydrostatic pressure gradient for fresh water is 0. 433 psi/ft. Geopressured reservoirs are overpressured; that is, the fluid pressure in the reservoir exceeds the pressure corresponding to the local hydrostatic pressure gradient. (Fig. 3) Confining bed or cap rock is necessary in order for a formation to be geopressured. Otherwise, the pressure would <b>equalize</b> <b>to</b> hydrostatic through upward flow. The pressures in a geopressured reservoir may approach the overburden pressure of about 1 psi/ft. Gulf Coast geopressured reservoirs typically exist between 12, 000 to 20, 000 feet below the surface. Flow rates of between 10, 000 to 40, 000 barrels per day, temperatures from 270 to 500 F, bottom hole pressures from 12, 000 to 18, 500 pounds psi, salinities of 20, 000 to 200, 000 milligrams per liter, and gas contents of 23 to 100 standard cubic feet per barrel, have been reported from geopressured wells...|$|E
