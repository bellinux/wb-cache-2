BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to Midlands Today at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances. One of the earliest stories he covered for them was the murder of Carl Bridgewater, the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} year of World War I, Göring served with his {{infantry}} regiment in the area of Mülhausen, a garrison town less than 2km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with rheumatism, a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the Luftstreitkräfte ("air combat force") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in Feldflieger Abteilung 25 (FFA 25)– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince's Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the Iron Cross, first class.|$|E
5|$|In 1148, a Council of Reims {{was called}} by Pope Eugene III to {{consider}} a number of regulations, or canons, for the Church, {{as well as to}} debate some other issues. Originally the summons for the council went out in October 1147 and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held in Trier, which is now in Germany, but conditions in Trier were such that it was moved to Reims, in France, for February 1148. A number of the summoned bishops and other church officials did not attend and Eugene suspended many of the non-attendees, excepting the Italian ecclesiastics, who were excused. The council lasted 11 days, and convened on 21 March 1148. From 400 to 1100 ecclesiastics are considered to have attended, although this number does not include the various servants and officials of the attendees, who would have swelled the numbers.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, in {{coordination}} with the Third Italian War of Independence and Garibaldi's campaign against the Austrians in the Trentino, Türr was assigned to prepare an uprising in Hungary involving György Klapka and other Hungarian exiles. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> launched from Serbian territory, {{but because of the}} fast ending of the Prussian-Austrian War including its Italian part, it never came to implementation, and the next year's developments rendered all such plans moot.|$|E

He used questionable statistics to describe accomplishments made by his administration in tourism and unemployment. After the speech the opposition stated that {{it is even more}} determined to take to the streets on the planned 30 June uprising against the president.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} at the Valley of the Kings was significant to the New Kingdom {{because it is}} where the pharaohs {{of the time and}} some other important people to the king were buried. The idea behind burying them there was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hidden location in a remote area since tomb robbing was a constant problem during Ancient Egyptian times. Unfortunately the location was not as secret as it was hoped to be, and most of the tombs were broken into and either robbed or damaged. Tutankhamun's tomb did suffer from some tomb robbing, but overall much of it was left intact and some areas including the burial chamber appeared to be left unscathed.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Japan invaded Indochina in 1940, {{keeping the}} Vichy French colonial {{administration}} {{in place as}} a puppet. In 1941 Nguyễn Ái Quốc, now known as Hồ Chí Minh, arrived in northern Vietnam to form the Việt Minh Front, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an umbrella group for all parties fighting for Vietnam's independence, but was dominated by the Communist Party. The Việt Minh had a modest armed force and during the war worked with the American Office of Strategic Services to collect intelligence on the Japanese. A famine broke out in 1944–45. Japan's defeat by World War II Allies created a power vacuum for Vietnamese nationalists of all parties to seize power in August 1945, forcing Emperor Bảo Đại to abdicate and ending the Nguyễn dynasty. Their initial success in staging uprisings and in seizing control {{of most of the}} country by September 1945 was partially undone, however, by the return of the French a few months later.|$|E

25|$|The four {{remaining}} British battlecruisers {{were still}} ahead of Evan-Thomas' 5th BS when first contact {{was made with}} the HSF. Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling error occurred with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by Lion and seen by Barham as it steamed past the now retreating Lion in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which was {{the point at which}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to 'turn in succession'. This means each ship turns as it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, Malaya, seeing the firefight ahead turned early.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, a {{non-profit}} art center {{situated in the}} 798 art district of Beijing, held a retrospective exhibition {{in honor of the}} late curator and scholar, Hans Van Dijk. Ai, a good friend of Hans and a fellow co-founder of the China Art Archives and Warehouse (CAAW), participated in the exhibition with three artworks. On the day of the opening, Ai realized his name was omitted from both Chinese and English versions of the exhibition's press release. Ai's assistants went to the art center and removed his works. It is Ai's belief that, in omitting his name, the museum altered the historical record of van Dijk's work with him. Ai started his own research about what actually happened, and between 23 and 25 May he interviewed the UCCA's director, Philip Tinari, the guest curator of the exhibition, Marianne Brouwer, and the UCCA chief, Xue Mei. He published the transcripts of the interviews on Instagram. In one of the interviews, the CEO of the UCCA, Xue Mei, admitted that, due to the sensitive time of the exhibition, Ai's name was taken out of the press releases {{on the day of the}} opening and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restored afterwards.
