5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} went ahead, with Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under the pretense of a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause. Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until the November election, but added that the Council elected in November would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must {{submit to the}} IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. The IOC members gathered in the Session <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC, officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E

25|$|Professors {{seem to be}} able {{to punish}} {{students}} with relative impunity and can hand out detention, even for unsatisfactory grades. Enforcement of rules outside of class mainly falls to the caretaker, with the assistance of the prefects. A student's Head of House usually has the final say in disciplinary matters. However, during Umbridge's tenure at Hogwarts, she quickly obtains the power to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say in disciplinary actions, due to an Educational Decree (one of many) passed by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge.|$|E
25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards of decency, why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) be the ones to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say over its interpretation? Is not the legislative branch which is elected, thereby more likely {{to be in touch with}} the current standards of decency, and therefore better placed to make such judgments? If originalism is wrong, then Marbury v. Madison—which holding underpins judicial review of constitutionality, that is, the meaning of the constitution—was wrongly decided, and two centuries of jurisprudence relying on it is thereby on shaky ground.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|In the February and March Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka {{hosted the}} 2011 World Cup. In England's first match they {{successfully}} chased a high total by Netherlands, with Bell contributing 33runs. Next England played India, {{put up a}} challenging total of 338. Bell and his captain Strauss set about consolidating England's position, while Bell survived a lbw decision off the bowling of left-arm spinner Yuvraj Singh. Opposition captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni asked for a review. TV replays and Hawk-Eye showed that Bell was indeed plumb. However, since there was a rule wherein the on-field umpire (Billy Bowden here) can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> decision if the batsman was 2.5 metres forward from the stumps, the umpire stood by his 'not out' decision. Bell went on to make 69 runs and almost helped England win comfortably. This match eventually ended in a tie.|$|E
25|$|The President, however, {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say over certain decisions, as Parliament may {{override}} his veto with a resolution supported by {{not less than}} two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments or withholds assent to bills {{that are likely to}} draw on the nation's past reserves. A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism is that the President must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers. The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy untrammelled power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the mixing}} {{engineers}} {{were aware of}} Timbaland and Furtado's rock influences, the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of [...] "the fancy mixer at the end".

According to Hecht, McMahon did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> say, but given his stature and RAW's importance to Spike TV at the time, the network wanted McMahon to [...] "be on board" [...] with the program lineup.

Despite noting that the sting was not realistic, he further enjoyed that Michael, Dwight, and Jim were allowed to react to the {{situation}} rather than becoming part of it. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review and praised the use of Meredith, calling her [...] "hilarious and so spot-on". Furthermore, he, like McNutt, enjoyed that Michael was portrayed as competent in the end. Hughes also enjoyed the B-story and wrote that [...] "it was a sweet moment when Darryl told Andy he didn't have to pay him any more to jam with them".|$|E
500|$|Green was {{considered}} for roles in The Constant Gardener (a role {{that went to}} Rachel Weisz) and The Black Dahlia. She was cast {{at the last minute}} for the role of Vesper Lynd in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006). Green was approached in mid-2005 but turned it down. Principal photography was already underway, and director Martin Campbell said casting the role was difficult because [...] "we didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> script and a Bond girl always had the connotation of tits 'n' ass." [...] Campbell saw Green's performance in the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, and approached Green again. She read the script, and found the character of Vesper far deeper than most Bond girls. Green's performance was well received: Entertainment Weekly called her the fourth-best Bond girl of all time; IGN named her the best femme fatale, stating, [...] "This is the girl that broke – and therefore made – James Bond"; and she won a BAFTA and an Empire award for her performance. Both awards were voted for by the British public.|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} was tardy in giving the final {{order for the}} statue to Bartlett, so late {{that it was impossible}} to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> bronze piece ready in time; a one-third model was only completed in May. [...] According to Q.David Bowers, [...] "the French are at home in such problems." [...] The {{commission was}} able to have a full-sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces [...] and distributing them to various workshops, that made enlargements in plaster. Brought together, the plaster pieces fitted perfectly. [...] This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du Carrousel on July 4, 1900. [...] Afterwards, Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design, and changed them. [...] His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin. [...] Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette's three-cornered hat, and the position of the raised arm and sword. The statue stood there for almost eighty years, but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre. [...] It now stands on Cours-la-Reine in Paris, along the River Seine.|$|E
