40|$|AbstractFibre Metal Laminates (FML) {{consisting}} of alternating stacked layers of polymer matrix composites and metallic foils are considered for structures with high fracture toughness and good impact resistance in aeronautic applications. The properties of thermoplastic Fibre Metal Laminates composed of titanium and carbon fibre reinforced polyetheretherketone (Ti/CF-PEEK laminates) are under investigation at DLR. The adhesion between the polyetheretherketone (PEEK) matrix and titanium degrades by {{the influence of}} humidity. Physical, chemo-physical and chemical surface pre-treatments of the titanium layers were tested to improve the long-term behaviour of the interface. To compare the different surface treatments, lap shear specimens were prepared and partly exposed to hot water (80 °C). Lap shear tests were conducted to determine the degradation of the initial strength by the influence of water. Concerning the physical pre-treatment, the laser pre-treatment offers the highest magnitude of <b>humidity</b> <b>resistance</b> because of the magnitude and kind of surface roughness. Concerning the chemo-physical pre-treatment, the anodization offers reduced initial bonding strength and reduced <b>humidity</b> <b>resistance</b> caused by the created oxide layer.

40|$|Soft rot {{is one of}} the {{destructive}} diseases of vegetables and occurs worldwide wherever fleshy storage tissues of vegetables and ornamentals are found. It causes a greater total loss of produce than any other bacterial disease. The disease can be found on crops in the field, in transit, in storage and during marketing; resulting in great economic losses. It is primarily caused by Erwinia carotovora sub-sp. carotovora and sometimes by Erwinia carotovora sub-sp. atroseptica. The soft rot disease has a very wide host range infecting vegetable species belonging to all families. Name of the disease aroused from the characteristic soft decay of fleshy tissue which terminates into watery or slimy mass. The bacteria enters the host tissue through injuries. The decay is aggravated when high humidity is coupled with high temperature which results in fast rate of multiplication of the pathogen. For this reason much of the loss due to this disease occurs during middle of the summer. Increased amounts of pecteolytic enzymes released by the pathogen results in maceration of tissue and are of great significance to the pathogenesis of the disease.
