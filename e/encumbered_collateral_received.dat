40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} the time to washout of radiographic contrast medium trapped distal to an occluded <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> vessel is inversely related to collateral flow, and that this provides an accurate method for characterising coronary collaterals.  METHODS—An intracoronary pressure derived collateral flow index was determined in 54  patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA). The study group was subdivided according to whether the collateral vessels were sufficient (n =  17) or insufficient (n =  37) to prevent ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia during PTCA. Washout collaterometry—an angiographic washout method—was carried out simultaneously; after injection of radiographic contrast medium into the <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> vessel followed immediately by vascular occlusion, the number of heart beats was counted until approximately half the length of the epicardial vessel was cleared of contrast.  RESULTS—The collateral flow index was higher (0. 28  (0. 09) v 0. 12  (0. 07); p <  0. 0001) and the contrast washout time shorter (8. 0  (2. 9) v 17. 5  (6. 7) heart beats; p <  0. 0001) in patients with sufficient versus insufficient collaterals. There was an inverse correlation between contrast washout time and collateral flow index (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 0001). Washout of contrast distal to the occluded vessel within 11  heart beats correctly determined sufficient and insufficient collaterals with 88 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity.  CONCLUSIONS—Washout collaterometry is a new radiographic contrast washout method based on the inverse relation between collateral flow and the time to clearance of radiographic dye injected into the ipsilateral vessel during PTCA. It appears to be an accurate method of characterising coronary collateral vessels.    Keywords: coronary artery disease; collateral circulation; coronary angiograph...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} {{consequences}} of frictions in financial intermediation. I theoretically analyse two financial contracts commonly found in the modern shadow banking system-rehypothecation and securitisation. Rehypothecation is the direct repledging of the <b>collateral</b> <b>received</b> in a debt contract by the intermediate lender, while securitisation {{is the use of}} the debt contract itself as collateral. I show that rehypothecation enables more efficient reuse of the collateral by the intermediate lender. I emphasise the role of the limited pledgeability of the intermediary in differentiating between the two contracts. In what has significant implications for monetary policy, I also show that open market operations undertaken with the intention of increasing liquidity and investment will take away collateral from the rehypothecation chain and be counterproductive to investment down the chain. I also examine the possibility of distortions created by large global financial institutions on emerging financial markets.

During balloon occlusion, echo contrast was injected into both main coronary arteries simultaneously. Echocardiography of the <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> myocardial area was performed. The time course of myocardial contrast enhancement in images acquired at end diastole was quantified by measuring pixel intensities (256  grey units) within a region of interest.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} in patients with poorly and well developed coronary collaterals {{was to assess the}} influence of collateral and collateral adjacent vascular resistances and, in part, a stenotic lesion of the collateral supplying vessel on the hemodynamic collateral responses to adenosine. BACKGROUNDIn humans, {{little is known about the}} functional behavior of the coronary collateral circulation. METHODSIn 50 patients with one- and two-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), collateral flow index (CFI, no unit) changes and vascular resistance index (R, cm/mm Hg) changes of the collateral (Rcoll) and the distal <b>collateral</b> <b>receiving</b> (R 4) vessel in response to adenosine (140 μg/min/kg IV) were measured by intracoronary (i. c.) Doppler and pressure guidewires. The variables were determined at baseline and during adenosine in patients with poor (angiographic collateral degree before PTCA < 2 of 0 to 3) and good coronary collaterals. RESULTSPressure-derived CFI (CFIp) decreased under adenosine in patients with poor collaterals, and it increased in the group with good collaterals. There were inverse correlations between the adenosine-induced change in CFIpand the change in Rcoll(r = 0. 61, p = 0. 0001). In the group with good, but not with poor collaterals, there was also a significant correlation between CFIpincrease and the decrease in R 4, between the severity of the contralateral stenosis and CFIpaugmentation and among the left versus right coronary artery as ipsilateral vessel and CFIpchange. CONCLUSIONSOverall, patients with well, versus poorly developed coronary collaterals do better regarding the capacity to increase collateral flow in response to adenosine. In patients with good, but not poor, collaterals, an adenosine-induced collateral flow increase depends on the ipsilateral distal vascular resistance decrease, but is also directly influenced by the severity of a contralateral stenosis and probably by the size of the collateralized vascular bed...|$|R
40|$|The striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) {{network is}} sparsely {{connected}} with fairly weak GABAergic <b>collaterals</b> <b>receiving</b> an excitatory glutamatergic cortical projection. Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) of MSN population response investigated in various experimental studies display strong firing rate modulations distributed throughout behavioral task epochs. In previous work {{we have shown}} by numerical simulation that sparse random networks of inhibitory spiking neurons with characteristics appropriate for UP state MSNs form cell assemblies which fire together coherently in sequences on long behaviorally relevant timescales when the network receives a fixed pattern of constant input excitation. Here we first extend that model to the case where cortical excitation is composed of many independent noisy Poisson processes and demonstrate that cell assembly dynamics is still observed when the input is sufficiently weak. However if cortical excitation strength is increased more regularly firing and completely quiescent cells are found, which depend on the cortical stimulation. Subsequently we further extend previous work to consider {{what happens when the}} excitatory input varies as it would when the animal is engaged in behavior. We investigate how sudden switches in excitation interact with network generated patterned activity. We show that sequences of cell assembly activations can be locked to the excitatory input sequence and outline the range of parameters where this behavior is shown. Model cell population PSTH display both stimulus and temporal specificity, with large population firing rate modulations locked to elapsed time from task events. Thus the random network can generate a large diversity of temporally evolving stimulus dependent responses even though the input is fixed between switches. We suggest the MSN network is well suited to the generation of such slow coherent task dependent response which could be utilized by the animal in behavior...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In adult living donor liver {{transplantation}} (LDLT), {{maintenance of}} adequate portal inflow {{is essential for}} the graft regeneration. Portal inflow steal (PFS) may occur due to presence of huge spontaneous porto-systemic collaterals. A surgical procedure to increase the portal inflow is rarely necessary in adult LDLT. Presentation: A 52 years male patient with end-stage liver disease due to chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Preoperative portography showed marked attenuated portal vein and its two main branches, patent tortuous splenic vein, multiple splenic hilar collaterals, and large lieno-renal <b>collateral.</b> He <b>received</b> a right hemi-liver graft from his nephew. Exploration revealed markedly cirrhotic liver, moderate splenomegaly with multiple collaterals and large lieno-renal collateral. Upon dissection of the hepato-duodenal ligament, a well-developed portal vein could be identified with a small mural thrombus. The recipient portal vein stump was anastomosed, in end to end fashion, to the graft portal vein. Doppler US showed reduced portal vein flow, so ligation of the huge lieno-renal collateral that allows steal of the portal inflow. After ligation of the lieno-renal collateral, improvement of the portal vein flow was observed in Doppler US. Discussion: There is no accepted algorithm for managing spontaneous lieno-renal shunts before, during, or after liver transplantation, and evidence for efficacy of treatments remains limited. We report a case of surgical interruption of spontaneous huge porto-systemic collateral to prevent PFS during adult LDLT. Conclusion: Complete interruption of large collateral vessels might be needed as a part of adult LDLT procedure to avoid devastating postoperative PFS...|$|R

This study uses a framing conceptual framework to analyse the British media's coverage of the Kosovo Conflict, and tries to identify hegemonic influences on that media coverage; the analysis therefore works on a cultural and political level. The study uses framing as it has been used in previous social-political studies, as a tool for analysing whether Nato's framing of their campaign dominated the media discourse, in line with the hegemonic model. The objectives of the study are to analyse whether the media were sufficiently independent from the Nato perspective to provide the public with a balanced and informed view of Nato's Kosovo campaign; whether the humanitarian aspect of the Nato campaign brought a change in the traditional reporting of Britain at war in the UK media; whether the reorganisation of the Nato media operation brought an improved coverage for Nato {{in the second half of}} their campaign, and whether a newspaper being editorially anti-war affected the rest of its content to any noticeable degree.

40|$|Glycinergic {{inhibition}} plays {{a central}} role in the auditory brainstem circuitries involved in sound localization and in the encoding of temporal action potential firing patterns. Modulation of this inhibition has the potential to fine-tune information processing in these networks. Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) signalling in the auditory brainstem (where activity-dependent generation of NO is documented) modulates the strength of inhibition by changing the chloride equilibrium potential. Recent evidence demonstrates that large inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in neurons of the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN) are enhanced by a very low intracellular chloride concentration, generated by the neuronal potassium chloride co-transporter (KCC 2) expressed in the postsynaptic neurons. Our data show that modulation by NO caused a 15 mV depolarizing shift of the IPSC reversal potential, reducing the strength of inhibition in SPN neurons, without changing the threshold for action potential firing. Regulating inhibitory strength, through cGMP-dependent changes in the efficacy of KCC 2 in the target neuron provides a postsynaptic mechanism for rapidly controlling the inhibitory drive, without altering the timing or pattern of the afferent spike train. Therefore, this NO-mediated suppression of KCC 2 can modulate inhibition in one target nucleus (SPN), without influencing inhibitory strength of other target nuclei (MSO, LSO) even though they are each <b>receiving</b> <b>collaterals</b> from the same afferent nucleus (a projection from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, MNTB) ...|$|R

Normal ventricles and hearts with slowly progressive narrowing {{of both the}} left circumflex coronary artery and the right coronary artery were studied. In spite of chronic occlusion of 2 coronary arteries myocardial infarction did not occur {{in the majority of}} animals because of collateral development. Coronary reserve was determined by producing graded to maximal coronary vasodilation. In normal hearts flow increased homogeneously over the entire left ventricle. In hearts with chronic coronary occlusion coronary vasodilation produced non-homogeneous increases in flow: <b>collateral</b> dependent myocardium <b>received</b> less blood flow than myocardium supplied by normal coronary arteries. Early after coronary occlusion the total coronary reserve was less than normal and the dilatory reserve of collateral dependent vessels was markedly diminished. Late (6 months) after coronary occlusion the total coronary reserve was still below normal but the dilatory reserve of collateral dependent vessels had improved. A new quantitative index of collateral function is defined as the level of coronary flow (delivered through normal coronary arteries) at which collateral flow deviates from homogeneous perfusion. Collateral function, when so defined, increases by a factor of almost 6 times between 4 weeks (early after coronary occlusion) and 6 months (late after occlusion) after the implantation of occluding devices. status: publishe...|$|R
