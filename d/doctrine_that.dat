5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E

5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> the Eucharist is a {{sacrifice}} of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|The Fleet Law of 1900 {{authorized}} the French Navy to build six new battleships, {{along with a}} host of other warship types; the law signaled an end to the Jeune École <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> emphasized commerce raiding and torpedo boats instead of a battle fleet of capital ships. The first two battleships ordered, the , formed the design basis for the subsequent four of the Liberté class. The naval engineer Émile Bertin designed both the République and Liberté classes.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} courts can, do, and often should {{implement}} constitutional guarantees indirectly, by crafting <b>doctrines</b> <b>that</b> raise {{the costs to}} government decision-makers of enacting constitutionally problematic policies. This strategy for implementing the Constitution contrasts with a more familiar approach, in which courts attempt to designate certain government actions, or categories of government actions, as permissible or impermissible. The article first explains, as a theoretical matter, how, why, and under what conditions judicial <b>doctrines</b> <b>that</b> manipulate legislative enactment costs {{may be a more}} effective tool for courts to implement the Constitution than <b>doctrines</b> <b>that</b> require direct judicial assessment of the relative strength of the competing interests at stake in any given case. The article then argues that the federal judiciary already has the capacity to fashion <b>doctrines</b> <b>that</b> function in this way, and current doctrine influences legislative enactment costs more than has generally been appreciated. Understanding both the theory of enactment cost manipulation {{and the ways in which}} existing doctrinal approaches may influence legislative enactment costs may be useful in evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of these doctrines, as well as suggesting different ways of thinking about doctrinal strategies for implementing the Constitution. By thinking more systematically about these issues, one may be able to craft <b>doctrines</b> <b>that</b> more effectively leverage the advantages associated with an enactment cost strategy while minimizing the inevitable shortcomings of such an approach...|$|R

Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the incorporation <b>doctrine)</b> <b>that</b> the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases.

5|$|Vermigli {{developed}} a strong doctrine of double predestination independently of John Calvin. His interpretation was that God's will determines both damnation {{as well as}} salvation. Vermigli's belief is similar but not identical to Calvin's. Vermigli's political theology was important in the Elizabethan religious settlement; he provided theological justification for Royal Supremacy, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> the king of a territory, rather than any ecclesiastical authority, rules the church.|$|E
5|$|With {{their victory}} in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese became {{concerned}} {{about the potential for}} conflict with the US. The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles, the first early in a war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon <b>Doctrine</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. {{would avoid}} direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> was {{far removed from the}} daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the danger was the requirement of the Japanese carrier <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E

The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E

The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of Continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing to fight in similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights. Though the men who were court martialed were pardoned, a campaign for a formal exoneration was launched.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>that</b> believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
