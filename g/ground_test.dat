5|$|Thirty-two astronauts were {{assigned}} to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earthâ€™s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on its surface, though none of them returned to the Moon after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32, Gus Grissom, Edward H.

5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the <b>ground</b> <b>test</b> model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E

25|$|The third Type 173 {{was first}} hovered on 9 November 1956 but further flights were stopped when engine {{overheating}} and transmission failures were experienced during ground rig trials. Although these problems were not severe {{they were used}} by the Admiralty {{as part of the}} case to cancel the British naval order and place an alternate order for the Westland-built variant of the US Sikorsky S-58s. Soon afterwards Canada cancelled the Type 193 in an economy drive. The company concentrated on the Gazelle-engined Type 192 for the Royal Air Force and the first two of the cancelled Type 191s were used as Gazelle <b>ground</b> <b>test</b> rigs, the third being used as a control fatigue rig. The original Royal Air Force order for 22 was increased to 26, and the first Type 192 (later named the Belvedere) flew on 5 July 1958.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} {{was to have}} been a more {{powerful}} and reusable solid fuel rocket derived from the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Compared with the Solid Rocket Booster, which had four segments, the most notable difference was the addition of a fifth segment. This fifth segment would have enabled the Ares I to produce more thrust. Other changes made to the Solid Rocket Booster were to have been the removal of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) attachment points and the replacement of the Solid Rocket Booster nosecone with a new forward adapter that would have interfaced with the liquid-fueled second stage. The adapter {{was to have been}} equipped with solid-fueled separation motors to facilitate the disconnection of the stages during ascent. The grain design was also changed, and so were the insulation and liner. By the Ares I first stage <b>ground</b> <b>test,</b> the case, grain design, number of segments, insulation, liner, throat diameter, thermal protection systems and nozzle had all changed.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, two Captive Firing Tests were {{conducted}} on the rocket which was to launch HTV-1. The first test, which consisted of firing the first stage for ten seconds, was originally scheduled to occur at 02:30 UTC on 27 March 2009, however it was cancelled after the launch pad's coolant system failed to activate. This was later discovered to {{have been due to}} a manual supply valve not being open. The test was rescheduled for 1 April, but then postponed again due to a leak in a pipe associated with the launch facility's fire suppression system. The test was rescheduled for 2 April, when it was successfully conducted at 05:00 UTC. Following this, the second test, which involved a 150-second burn of the first stage, was scheduled for 20 April. This was successfully conducted at 04:00 UTC on 22 April, following a two-day delay due to unfavourable weather conditions. A <b>ground</b> <b>test,</b> using a battleship mockup of the rocket was subsequently conducted on 11 July.|$|E

As part of their training, astronauts inside the capsule were dropped into the Gulf of Mexico by a crane from an aircraft carrier to simulate the force of splashdown. Apollo crews also trained for extended recovery by remaining at sea for several {{days at a time}} in the Command Module. This prepared astronauts for the possibility of a splashdown far from the planned recovery site. In 1971, CM 007 was transported to Eglin Air Force Base, where it was exposed to cold water and cold air during testing through 1973 for the forthcoming Skylab program. It was displayed at several open houses during this period at the base. The Command Module survived the tests only to end up in an equipment lot of the Houston Department of Public Works, where it remained for 12 years. In 1988, CM 007 was restored for the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, where it is now preserved, by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center.|$|E

500|$|The {{development}} of special fuel {{was attributed to}} the work of [...] "Rod" [...] Banks, an engineer who specialised in fuels and engine development. After using neat benzole for early <b>ground</b> <b>test</b> runs; a mixture of 11% aviation petrol and 89% benzole, plus 5cubic centimetres (cc) of tetra-ethyl lead per Imperial gallon (4.5L) was tried. This blend of fuel was used to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, and continued to be used until June 1931. It was discovered that adding 10% methanol to this mixture resulted in a 20hp (15kW) increase, with the further advantage of reduced fuel weightâ€“ particularly important for aircraft useâ€“ due to its lowered specific gravity. For the 1931 airspeed record attempt acetone was added to prevent intermittent misfiring, the composition of this final blend was 30% benzole, 60% methanol, and 10% acetone, plus 4.2cc of tetra-ethyl lead per gallon.|$|E
