40|$|This {{study is}} to carry out {{investigation}} on increasing fault gas in oil insulation in three similar <b>excitation</b> <b>transformers</b> in XX: Transformer A, Transformer B, and Transformer C. The research covers the transformer oil sample collection, and the experiment of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) in laboratory. Then, the DGA results as raw data are evaluated using two methods which are Duval Triangle and Rogers Ratio in order to interpret and estimate the possible internal fault that may present in all transformers. The research is also included with three mitigation procedures and one verification test on selected transformer respectively. First procedure study is replacing Transformer A with spare. Second method is oil insulation degasification from Transformer B. Third procedure is continued with high frequency of DGA monitoring of Transformer C. The results from all case studies are again interpreted and checked with Duval Triangle and Roger’s Ratio for before and after outcome comparison. In addition to, the investigation is widened with electrical diagnostics tests which are carried out on Transformer A in order to verify {{the root cause of}} internal fault. The decision of serviceability of all <b>excitation</b> <b>transformers</b> are successfully made by having a Transformer Health Index (THI) using the condition factors as mentioned above.

40|$|Being {{driven by}} natural commutating inverter, {{induction}} motor frequently self-excites due to peculiar circuit formation of inverter. Then {{in this paper}} we proposed the checking method of self-excitation of induction motor by controlling the DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer,</b> and proved its availability. It is shown in chapter 3 that self-excitation of induction motor is expressed as functions of circuit constants of inverter and degree of DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer.</b> From these facts we set up the relation between the bounds of induction motor and DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer,</b> and proved that self-excitation of induction motor could be checked by controlling the DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer.</b> In chapter 4, we calculated this theoretical results using the constants of 6 KW inverter, compered this calculated values with experimental ones, and verified the theoretical results. Control method discussed here has special merits that self-excitation of induction motor is checked perfectly without changing the circuit constants of inverter and also its control procedure is very easy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{aspects of}} the approximation theory application on the certain subsets of the measured samples of the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current and the sinusoidal magnetic flux. The presented analysis is performed for single-phase transformer case, Epstein frame case and toroidal core case. In the paper the theorem of direct mapping the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current in the stationary regime is proposed. The excitation current is mapped to the dynamic hysteresis loop branch (in further text DHLB) by an appropriate cosine transformation. This theorem provides the necessary and satisfactory conditions for above described mapping. The theorem highlights that the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current under the sinusoidal magnetic flux has qualitatively equivalent information about magnetic core properties as the DHLB. Furthermore, the theorem establishes direct relationship {{between the number of}} the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current harmonics and their coefficients with the degree of the DHLB interpolation polynomial and its coefficients. The DHLB interpolation polynomial is calculated over the measured subsets of samples representing Chebyshev nodes of the first and the second kind. These nonequidistant Chebyshev nodes provides uniform convergence of the interpolation polynomial to the experimentally obtained DHLB with an excellent approximation accuracy and are applicable on the approximation of the static hysteresis loops and the DC magnetization curves as well...|$|R

This location method requires the installation of a grounding resistance in the secondary winding of the <b>excitation</b> <b>transformer.</b> First, the third-harmonic reference voltage is obtained by the voltage measurements in the excitation system. Then, the third-harmonic voltage at the grounding resistor is compared to the reference voltage. The ground fault is detected when the phase angle between those voltages is under the trip setting value.

40|$|Modeling of unified {{power flow}} control (UPFC) into multi-machine power systems by Wang, {{published}} by IET, has been widely quoted by many researchers. However, the correctness of the derivation of its equations has not been strictly scrutinized. The model cannot properly represent power system networks {{in its current form}} and need to be corrected. In this paper, the model proposed by Wang is revisited and the equations re-derived obtaining different results. The corrected model was developed and tested on three-machine and New England power systems installed with a UPFC. The DC link capacitor voltage is controlled in UPFC by modulating the phase angle of the <b>excitation</b> <b>transformer</b> voltage. The effect of the controller in damping of the low-frequency oscillations is demonstrated by using the proposed correct model and the results are compared with model presented by Wang...|$|E
40|$|Because natural commutating {{inverter}} builts up AC {{output voltage}} following to circuit condition and valve action of inverter, AC output voltage and leading angle of inverter vary widely with change of load and disturbance. In order to operate this inverter stably, AC output voltage and leading angle of inverter must be controlled at constant value even if load changes. Then several steps {{have been taken}} for these purposes. But these {{can be done by}} controlling of DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer.</b> Constant control of AC output voltage by this method has been reported, so we discuss the constant control of leading angle by adjusting DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer</b> in this paper. It is proved theoretically in chapter 2 that the leading angle is controlled by DC <b>excitation</b> of inverter <b>transformer.</b> And this fact is proved experimentally by 6 KW inverter in chapter 4. In chapter 4 we expressed the leading angle control system of invetter with block diagram also, and obitained the transient response of the system to reference input, load resistance and capacitance changes. From these steady state and transient responses, it has been pointed out that： (1) controllable domain of leading angle is determined by construction of inverter circuit, (2) the response speed of leading angle is determined by the time constant of DC source circuit of inverter, and (3) construction of the control system discussed here is easier than others...|$|R

However, push-pull more commonly refers to a two-switch topology with a split primary winding.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel excitation-system {{ground-fault}} location {{method is}} described and {{tested in a}} 106 MVA synchronous machine. In this unit, numerous rotor ground-fault trips took place always about {{an hour after the}} synchronization to the network. However, when the field winding insulation was checked after the trips, there was no failure. The data indicated that the faults in the rotor were caused by centrifugal forces and temperature. Unexpectedly, by applying this new method, the failure was located in a cable between the <b>excitation</b> <b>transformer</b> and the automatic voltage regulator. In addition, several intentional ground faults were performed along the field winding with different fault resistance values, in order to test the accuracy of this method to locate defects in rotor windings of large generators. Therefore, this new on-line rotor ground-fault detection algorithm is tested in high-power synchronous generators with satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|The article {{explains}} {{the operation of}} power systems {{from the point of}} view of physics. Physicists imagine things, rather than in terms of impedances and circuits, in terms of fields and energy conversions. The account is concrete and simple. The use of alternating current entails the issue of reactive power. Reactive power consists of energy that oscillates between electrical and magnetic fields, it flows on top of the active power which carries the useful energy. The control of active and reactive power is essential for the power system’s reliable operation. The frequency of a power system is the same everywhere. The stability of the frequency indicates that generation and demand of active power are equal, a decline in frequency indicates a lack of generation relative to the demand. Adapting the electrical power injected into the system is the way of frequency control. Because of the parasitic inductances and capacitances of overhead lines, cables, and transformers, the voltage at different locations of the power system depends on the load. The voltage is regulated by the combined action of generator <b>excitation,</b> <b>transformer</b> tap changers and series compensation in order to provide consumers with a stable voltage supply. The integration of solar cells and wind turbines into the power system poses some challenges. But the power system is able to accommodate large amounts of fluctuating renewable power generation if the right complementary measures are taken...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a low DC voltage in a power grid produces an excitation asymmetry for the distribution transformers, resulting in unwanted half-cycle saturation that may impair transformer safety, reliability and efficiency, especially in increasing the reactive power, stray losses and iron losses. This paper highlights a diagnostic method based on the phase value of the particular even harmonics of a <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current as the basic marker of an excitation asymmetry.

40|$|To {{verify that}} the inner design and its {{performance}} are satisfactory {{and that there are}} no failures in the winding insulation system and core displacement during long-trip transport, we need to do several tests such as SFRA test or single-phase excitation test.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig.  7 that, before {{excitation}} impedance being injected to the system, the instantaneous value of short-circuit current goes extremely high as the peak value is several times bigger of its rated peak value before 0.2  s. After 0.21  s, the secondary side of the series transformer BT is switched to an open-circuit condition, fault current decreases enormously due to the influence of <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> impedance, to about 1 / 4 of its original short-circuit current peak value. It {{can be seen}} in Table  2 that the fault current suppression can reach of 62.0 % to 76.4 %, much more effective than the effect of below 10 % of PSA control in our previous researches [20]. Because the series transformer’s secondary side is switched to an open-circuit status by EIS control, the TCPST can act as a new type of short-circuit current limiter.|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} {{of this paper}} is as follows. The varying equivalent impedance of TCPST is derived in Section  2, according to the working mode of the power electronic switches. The phase shifting angle (PSA) control for fault current limiting, is briefly analyzed in Section  3. Since it has been proven to have not very good suppression effect on the short-circuit fault current in our previous work [20], a novel short-circuit fault current suppression method named as <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> impedance switching (EIS) control is proposed, based on the varying impedance characteristics of TCPST. Simulation results have shown that the novel EIS control method has a more remarkable current suppressing performance. Then, Section  4 evaluates the potential interruption time sequence for power circuit breakers and the mechanical support issues that might be induced by the EIS control scheme. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section  5.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Magnetic core {{saturation}} of transformers and rotating machines generate harmonics. Harmonics are integer multiples of {{the fundamental}} frequency. Harmonics is caused by nonlinear devices in the power system. Due to the non-linear loads, power frequency harmonics exist mainly in distribution systems. The current harmonics cause voltage harmonics, hence resulting in nonsinusoidal supply voltage in the system. Harmonic voltage distortion may cause additional losses and heating in laminated transformer cores due to the distorted flux waveform. Meaning of saturation means that further increase in magnetic field force (mmf) do not result in proportional increase in magnetic field flux. This paper includes the effect of saturation on hysteresis and excitation current of 100 kVA Distribution transformer. This paper presents a hysteresis based transformer simulink model to estimate transformer saturation. The basic idea of the method is to evaluate the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current and hysteresis with and without core saturation effect.

30|$|Short-circuit {{fault current}} {{suppression}} {{is a very}} important issue in modern large-interconnected power networks. Conventional short-circuit current limiters, such as superconducting fault current limiters, have to increase additional equipment investments. Fast power electronics controlled flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices have opened a new way for suppressing the fault current levels, while maintaining their normal functionalities for steady-state and transient power system operation and control. Thyristor controlled phase shifting transformer (TCPST) is a beneficial FACTS device in modern power systems, which is capable of regulating regional power flow. The mathematical model for TCPST under different operation modes is firstly investigated in this study. Intuitively, the phase shifting angle control can adjust the equivalent impedance of TCPST, but the effect has been demonstrated to be weak. Therefore, a novel <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> impedance switching (EIS) control method, is proposed for fault current suppressing, according to the impedance characteristics of TCPST. Simulation results on IEEE 14 -bus system have shown considerable current limiting characteristic of the EIS control under various fault types. Also, analysis of the timing requirement during fault interruption, overvoltage phenomenon, and ancillary mechanical support issues during EIS control is discussed, so as to implement the proposed EIS control properly for fast fault current suppression.|$|R
40|$|The {{transformers}} are {{an integral}} part of the power system. Due to the non-linear loads, the transformers are much affected by the distorted currents and supply voltages which largely reduce its efficiency due to overheating. Thus analyzing this problem and reducing the losses of transformer has become a major area of research in today’s scenario. This report includes the effects of non-sinusoidal supply voltage on the <b>transformer</b> <b>excitation</b> current and the core losses which includes eddy current and hysteresis losses. The time domain waveform of excitation current and flux are observed. The equivalent circuit model of the transformer under no load was taken to observe the waveforms. The fast Fourier transform of the excitation current is performed to analyse the harmonics and the total harmonic distortion is shown for various harmonic components.

The modelling of the transformer is performed for linear core i. e without saturation and also for non-linear core i. e with saturation effects.

5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a <b>transformer,</b> <b>excitation</b> voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|R
40|$|Nepal has huge {{hydropower}} {{potential of}} 83, 000 MW, of which 42, 000 MW is technically and economically feasible. According {{to the annual}} report of Nepal Electricity Authority, the total installed capacity of hydropower in Nepal is only 733. 57 MW. Although bestowed with tremendous hydropower resources, only about 40 % of Nepal s population has access to electricity and remaining 60 % faces severe load shedding. In this scenario, the cross border transmission links between Nepal and India serves two purposes. First, since Nepal still is short of electric power, these transmission links {{can be used to}} import power from India. Second, in future when there is surplus electric power in Nepal, {{it can be used to}} transfer power to India. In the thesis, a model of integrated power system of Nepal is made in the Matlab Simulink. All the major power plants with capacity above 30 MW has been considered. The plants are connected to major loads with the transmission lines. In the start of the thesis, it was planned to find the real parameters of generators, governors, <b>excitation</b> systems, power <b>transformers,</b> transmission lines and loads. But later because of difficulty in finding the real parameters, the standard values were used. The grid on the Indian side is represented by three phase voltage source. The best place for transmission link with India is in the central region between Butwal and Dhalkebar. Among different options for putting cross border transmission line, Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur link is considered for the thesis. Different possible configuration were made using HVAC and HVDC in the cross border link. The HVAC link is considered first and then HVDC is kept in parallel. The power through the HVDC transmission line is regulated by setting the parameter values in the controller of the HVDC model. The simulation result shows that the system is unstable when there is HVAC in the cross border link. With HVDC only, the system is stable and also the control of the power flow through cross border is possible. Different condition of power transfer has been obtained and presented. Even though the values of generators parameters were taken as standard parameters, the excitation and governor parameters were same for all power plants. Either real value of the parameters should be used or standard values should be used according to the size and location of the power plant. The location of hydropower plants and load center are exact. The rated capacity of Upper Tamakoshi hydro plant is taken as 100 MVA, although its actual capacity is 540 MVA. It was because for its rated capacity above 100 MVA, the system becomes unstable. During the simulation, the control of power flow through HVAC was not possible. The model involving HVAC was not stable also. Stable condition were found using HVDC only...|$|R
