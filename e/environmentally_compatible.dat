Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be reformed efficiently through catalyst aided partial oxidation over noble metals such as rhodium and the hydrocarbons can also be converted into basic chemical substances.

40|$|AbstractThe Arctic {{remains of}} great {{interest}} for extractive industry development, despite fluctuating mineral and hydrocarbon prices, and the technological and political challenges of accessing these resources. The articles in this special section explore the realities of living close to extractive industries in the Arctic; the expectations surrounding extractive projects; the nature of local and distributed benefits; {{and the extent to}} which local knowledge is incorporated into public debates. In this introduction, we consider how an ‘extractivist’ logic can stifle other ways for local communities to imagine the future, contrasting this with local perspectives based on sustainability and co-existence with nature. Where industrial activity takes place, local involvement in shaping an industry’s ‘social licence to operate’ offers a counterbalance to an ‘extractivist’ imperative, by focusing more on equitable benefit sharing and protection of local livelihoods and the environment. We conclude that rights holders and others directly affected by industry operations can use their own knowledge to ensure that decisions are sensitive to longer-term sustainability risks, and that alternative development options are adequately considered. An empowered local civil society also has an important role in ensuring extractive industry operations are <b>environmentally</b> sound and <b>compatible</b> with existing local livelihoods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Environmental {{issues and}} the {{depletion}} of worldwide crude oil sources have developed the requirement for an alternative fuel to power internal combustion engines. Vegetable oil, waste cooking oil and biodiesel are all renewable, <b>environmentally</b> sustainable and <b>compatible</b> with current Compression Ignition (CI) engines with little to no engine modification necessary. These fuels however have a higher viscosity than conventional petro-diesel and may {{be referred to as}} Higher Viscous Fuels (HVF). HVF have reduced in-cylinder combustion efficiency when compared with petro-diesel which reduces the engine performance in terms of output power, torque and fuel efficiency. A possible solution to the reduced efficiency is {{through the use of a}} Guide Vane Swirl and Tumble Device (GVSTD). This device when installed in front of the air intake manifold may produce improved air flow characteristics. This improves the efficiency of the evaporation processes and air-fuel mixing and therefore improves overall combustion efficiency. The effect of GVSTDs on in-cylinder air flow was studied using 3 D Internal Combustion (IC) engine simulation under motored engine conditions. This was done using ANSYS-CFX. The base model engine was adapted from the Hino W 04 D model CI engine. The model throughout all simulations was run at a constant speed of 1500 rpm.

40|$|Large scale {{energy storage}} system with low cost, high power, and long cycle life is crucial for {{addressing}} the energy problem when connected with renewable energy production. To realize grid-scale applications of the energy storage devices, there remain several key issues including the development of low-cost, high-performance materials that are <b>environmentally</b> friendly and <b>compatible</b> with low-temperature and large-scale processing. In this report, we demonstrate that solution-exfoliated graphene nanosheets (∼ 5 nm thickness) can be conformably coated from solution on three-dimensional, porous textiles support structures for high loading of active electrode materials and to facilitate the access of electrolytes to those materials. With further controlled electrodeposition of pseudocapacitive MnO 2 nanomaterials, the hybrid graphene/MnO 2 -based textile yields high-capacitance performance with specific capacitance up to 315 F/g achieved. Moreover, we have successfully fabricated asymmetric electrochemical capacitors with graphene/MnO 2 -textile as the positive electrode and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) -textile as the negative electrode in an aqueous Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte solution. These devices exhibit promising characteristics with a maximum power density of 110 kW/kg, an energy density of 12. 5 Wh/kg, and excellent cycling performance of ∼ 95 % capacitance retention over 5000 cycles. Such low-cost, high-performance energy textiles based on solution-processed graphene/MnO 2 hierarchical nanostructures offer great promise in large-scale energy storage device applications. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|As feature sizes in {{semiconductor}} devices become smaller and newer materials are incorporated, current methods for photoresist and post plasma etch residue removal face several challenges. A cleaning process should be <b>environmentally</b> benign, <b>compatible</b> with dielectric materials and copper, and provide residue removal from narrow and high aspect ratio features. In this work, sub-critical CO 2 based mixtures {{have been developed}} to remove the etch residues; these mixtures satisfy the above requirements and can potentially replace the two step residue removal process currently used in the integrated circuit (IC) industry. Based on the chemical nature of the residue being removed, additives or co-solvents to CO 2 have been identified that can remove the residues without damaging the dielectric layers. Using the phase behavior of these additives as a guide, the composition of the co-solvent was altered to achieve a single liquid phase at moderate pressures without compromising cleaning ability. The extent of residue removal has been analyzed primarily by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Various techniques such as attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS), and interferometry were used to probe the interaction of cleaning fluids with residues. Model films of photoresists and plasma deposited residues were used to assist in understanding the mechanism of residue removal. From these studies, it was concluded that residue removal takes place primarily by attack of the interface between the residue and the substrate; a solvent rinse then lifts these residues from the wafer. It has been shown that transport of the additives to the interface is enhanced in the presence of CO 2. From positronium annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) studies on a porous dielectric film, {{it has been shown that}} these high pressure fluids do not cause significant changes to the pore sizes or the bonding structure of the film. Hence, this method can be used to remove post etch residues from low-k dielectric films. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Dennis W. Hess; Committee Member: Dr. Amyn S.

40|$|The PhD thesis {{highlights}} {{the consequences of}} a fast, mainly uncontrolled and often reckless tourism development exemplary for the Turkish coast in the surrounding area of Kemer. This tourism development has taken place {{to the detriment of the}} existing natural, cultural and social potential of this coastal area. After the “Tourism Promotion Law” was passed in 1982 these effects are especially due to the increasing pressure from foreign mass tourism. In the long term this kind of development endangers the very existence of tourism in the region itself, because tourism has become very important in the intervening years. Both as an economical factor and a feature of an attractive recreation area tourism particularly depends on an intact landscape and socio-cultural balance of the population. The appropriate alternative to the previous development should be a sustainable, <b>environmentally</b> and socially <b>compatible</b> tourism concept, which takes into account the specific features of the surrounding area of Kemer to a large extent and also protects its attraction as a recreation area. For this the bases of the previous tourism planning (Part I) and their legal foundation (Part II) were summarised and analyzed, and the South-Antalya-Tourism Development Area and selected tourism facilities were also analyzed and assessed in situation(Part III). Based on this suggestions for effective, regional- and landscape compatible planning and structuring concepts were developed (Part IV). The inter-dependence of the individual levels of a analysis, i. e. legal-, macro- and object-level became obvious after the basic evaluation. It required, inter alia, an inter-disciplinary view, -of, for example the mechanism of relevant planning methods-, the importance of the landscape architecture in connection with tourism planning and their influence on the development of enviromentally and socially compatible tourism concepts in sensitive coastal areas and so on. Adequate structuring concepts for future tourism facilities on the other hand required a more sophisticated view in comparison to the law- and macro-level of tourism planning. The often doubtful and thoughtless structuring solutions in the surrounding area of Kemer (often in conflict with the genius loci) could be countered only with regional- and landscape compatible structuring concepts, which have led to significant intensification on the object-level. Also the competence of the architect and the efficiency of this design are more clearly recognizable here than on the other mentioned levels of tourism planning. In this context solution approaches are presented as examples for meeting, the requirements for regional- and landscape-compatibility and resident-friendliness of a structuring concept...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the success}} of PANTIL {{sub-project}} integrated dairy production systems in Njombe District villages an idea of piloting the Promising Agricultural Production Methods evolved among the University of Life Sciences (UMB) and SUA experts {{by the end of}} the programme in 2010. The idea was shared with the Private Companies namely YARA (International Fertilizer Company) and SYANGETA (an international Company dealing with agricultural inputs). In October 2010 a Public –Private Partnership (PPP) team composed of SUA, UMB, YARA and SANGETA researchers conducted a reconnaissance survey in Manyara, Morogoro and Iringa regions with an aim of establishing demonstration farms for piloting promising agricultural methods that are environmentally friendly and climate compatible. In order to establish a baseline data of soil physical and chemical properties of the farms and recommend the use of fertilizers accordingly before crop planting, soil samples were collected from 8 farms in Nov 2010; 1 in Manyara region (Malbadaw wheat farm), 4 in Morogoro region (Gairo and Mgeta maize farms and Dihombo and Lungo rice farms), and 3 from Iringa region (Ibumila, Lunyannywi, Kichiwa maize farms). At each farm, historical background was recorded before soil sampling. Then a free survey was done to know the boundary and size of the farm. Important feature of the farm such as landform, soil colour, soil texture were observed so as to draw sampling units. At each sampling unit 10 to 15 points were selected in zigzag fashion and at each point a pit of 60 x 60 cm was made and two soil samples were collected one each in two sampling depth 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm. Soils were air dried, sieved through 2 mm sieve, packed and sent to the soil laboratory for analysis. The farms in Iringa region were planted with maize in mid Dec. 2010 while those in Morogoro were planted with rice in Feb 2011. A baseline survey involving 5 villages (i. e. 3 in Njombe district- Iringa and 2 in Mvomero district- Morogoro) where the demonstration farms were established was conducted in March 2011. Twenty farming households (HH) were involved (i. e. 4 HH per village; 2 in and 2 out of demonstration farms). The aim of the HH baseline survey was to collect information on HH characteristics, current land-use and agricultural practices, use of inputs such as seeds, pest and weed control, and the timing and nature of agricultural activities related to maize and rice cultivation. The crops were harvested in June and July 2011 in Morogoro and Iringa, respectively. Historically, it was noted that, except for the large wheat farm in Manyara region, most HH did not apply enough fertilizer to their farms. Use of nitrogen fertilizer ranged from 1. 5 to 1. 8 bags of urea per ha. Fertilizers use regardless of type ranged from 67 to 87 %. Use of pesticides was greatly pronounced in Njombe (90 % of the HH) as compared to Mvomero (50 %of the HH). In both districts, 64 % of the HH just recycle the seeds they produce from their own farms. Except for the Malbadaw and Gairo farms which had high ph value (> 7) all other farms had pH values ranging from very low (< 4. 3) to low (4. 4 – 5. 0). Soil Phosphorus, Potassium, Magnesium, Sulphur, Copper and Zinc values were very low in Iringa farms and low to medium for the Morogoro and Manyara region farms. Intervention with correct fertilizer application, weed management and pest management increased the yield of rice in Dihombo from 1438 kg/ha to 5400 kg/ha and maize yield in Kichiwa-Njombe increased from 2625 kg/ha to 4375 kg/ha. The increase in crop yield improved HH farming profitability substantially. Preliminarily it can be concluded that Public –Private Partnership collaboration can improve substantially the <b>environmentally</b> climate <b>compatible</b> agricultural growth. However, enough time is required in testing the model meanwhile its real economic and social impacts being assessed. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION - CLIMATE CHANGECCIA...|$|R

The South Pacific Appropriate Technology Foundation (SPATF) is a community based, non-profit development organization, established in 1977, as a special project of the Papua New Guinea former Office of Village Development, and was incorporated as a company limited under guarantee. SPATF's aim is to explore and promote technological alternatives and to assist people to select and use the best technical solution to meet their basic development needs. The majority of the rural population in Papua New Guinea live at subsistence level. The lack of education, skills and capital resources mean that they must use simple and inexpensive technologies to generate goods and services to meet their needs, because high level capital intensive technologies are beyond their reach. SPATF promotes technology which is low-cost, locally available, and simple to maintain. It must be <b>environmentally</b> and socially <b>compatible,</b> affordable, manageable, and controllable by poor people, and use tools and techniques which take advantage of local resources of knowledge, skills and materials to satisfy people's basic needs. To do this, SPATF works through its operational divisions, known as the Community Enterprise Support Unit (CESU). Each CESU promotes the technology and services appropriate for creating employment' because in Papua New Guinea only 10 % of each year's school leavers find jobs. There is a CESU in Port Moresby known as Small Industries Centre, and in Lae, called Village Equipment Suppliers. The islands will soon have their own at Mount Hagen and in Rabal.
