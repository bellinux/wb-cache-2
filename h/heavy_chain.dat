5|$|Each <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} types of {{mammalian}} Ig <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> denoted by the Greek letters: α, δ, ε, γ, and μ. The type of <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> present defines {{the class of}} antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively. Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, whereas μ and ε have approximately 550 amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.

40|$|AbstractUnassembled Ig <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> are {{retained}} in the ER via the binding of BiP to the CH 1 domain, which remains unoxidized. Interestingly, this domain folds rapidly, albeit nonproductively, when <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> are released from BiP in vitro with ATP. The in vivo cycling of BiP from <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> was monitored using BiP ATPase mutants as kinetic traps. Our data suggest that BiP does not cycle from the CH 1 domain of free <b>heavy</b> <b>chains.</b> However, <b>heavy</b> and light <b>chain</b> assembly occurs rapidly and requires the ATP-dependent release of BiP. We propose that BiP's ATPase cycle is stalled or nonproductive when it is bound to free <b>heavy</b> <b>chains.</b> The binding of light chains to the complex reactivates the cycle and releases BiP...|$|R

5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin <b>heavy</b> <b>chain.</b> Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosomal}} region that encodes an antibody {{is large and}} contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> genes (IGH@) is found on chromosome 14, and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes (IGL@ and IGK@) are found on chromosomes 22 and 2 in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or complementarity determining regions (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes {{with an array of}} genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies {{with a high degree of}} variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E

5000|$|Myosin II {{contains}} two <b>heavy</b> <b>chains,</b> each about 2000 amino acids in length, which constitute {{the head and}} tail domains. Each of these <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> contains the N-terminal head domain, while the C-terminal tails take on a coiled-coil morphology, holding the two <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> together (imagine two snakes wrapped around each other, as in a caduceus). Thus, myosin II has two heads. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. In smooth muscle, a single gene (MYH11) codes for the <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> myosin II, but splice variants of this gene result in four distinct isoforms.|$|R
40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) early glycoprotein {{products of}} the US 11 and US 2 open reading frames cause increased turnover of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I <b>heavy</b> <b>chains.</b> Since US 2 is homologous to another HCMV gene (US 3), we hypothesized that the US 3 gene product also may affect MHC class I expression. In cells constitutively expressing the HCMV US 3 gene, MHC class I <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> formed a stable complex with beta 2 -microglobulin. However, maturation of the N-linked glycan of MHC class I <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> was impaired in US 3 + cells. The glycoprotein product of US 3 (gpUS 3) occurs mostly in a high-mannose form and coimmunoprecipitates with beta 2 -microglobulin associated class I <b>heavy</b> <b>chains.</b> Mature class I molecules were detected at steady state {{on the surface of}} US 3 + cells, as in control cells. Substantial perinuclear accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> was observed in US 3 + cells.

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
5|$|In early 1861 the {{critical}} border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the American Civil War. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky. The riverside town was situated on 180 foot high bluffs that commanded {{the river at}} that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines and a <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> that stretched a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce {{to the south and}} beyond.|$|E
5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of HLA class I <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> with ß 2 -microglobulin (ß 2 m) changes their antigenic profile.

5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of myosin <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E

40|$|Inter-alpha-inhibitor (IalphaI) is a 180 -kDa {{serum protein}} {{consisting}} of three polypeptides. Two of these, the <b>heavy</b> <b>chains</b> 1 and 2 (H 1 and H 2), are of 75 - 80 kDa and have similar amino acid sequences.

25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In follicular lymphoma, a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin <b>heavy</b> <b>chain</b> locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E
