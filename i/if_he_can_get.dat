500|$|Sean {{leaves to}} jog the [...] {{out of the}} forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep. He comes across some run down {{buildings}} where he finds a hunting paraphernalia, a bear trap, and dead animals. As he leaves, the bear appears. He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him {{on the roof of the}} shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a signal on his cell phone. It does not work and the Bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back.|$|E
500|$|The version {{used for}} the first test {{screening}} featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy which takes place after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon, but the test audiences disliked it. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and featured Cal (falsely) offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Just as {{they are about to}} escape him, Lovejoy notices Rose's hand slap the water as it slips off the table behind which she is hiding. In revenge for framing him for the [...] "theft" [...] of the necklace, Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a glass window, which explains the gash on Lovejoy's head that can be seen when he dies in the completed version of the film. In their reactions to the scene, test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.|$|E
2500|$|Sonny visits hard-hearted Danny in his posh {{office in}} {{downtown}} Los Angeles {{and tries to}} convince him to donate the theater for the roller disco, because it would bring the arts to the Fairfax district and drive up real estate values. [...] But Danny scoffs, {{even though he had}} plans to open the theater himself, once upon a time. As Sonny leaves, [...] "Kira" [...] arrives, jogging Danny's memories of an old love and dance partner of his, who looked suspiciously like [...] "Kira," [...] named Kitty("Whenever You're Away from Me"). Kitty tells Danny that although he had let his greed stop him from pursuing his dream to open the theater 35 years ago, {{he has a chance to}} redeem himself now by opening the roller disco with Sonny. [...] Danny finds Sonny and tells him that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the disco up and running in one day, he'll give him 25% of the take from the Disco ("Dancin'").

Ruth asks Smailey what's wrong with Mrs. Van Brugh, and Smailey announces that ruin will soon befall her, and he begins to tell Ruth [...] "what she has been". Ruth {{interrupts}} and points out that what Mrs. Van Brugh is now {{is more important than}} what she was, and that his past was hardly blameless. Ruth tells him to take what's his, but no more. As Smailey stands to benefit <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> Mrs. Van Brugh removed as beneficiary of her godfather's will, he plans to commence proceedings to get what's his. Ruth is furious and announces that if he does so, she'll reveal the evidence of his past fraud. Smailey tries to weasel out of it, saying that [...] "Mrs. Van Brugh would admit the justice of his claim", and he gets Ruth to agree that if Mrs. Van Brugh makes a statement of her own free will, Ruth will let it pass. As Ruth leaves, Smailey rants about the injustice of his past sin being held over his head, whilst planning to condemn Mrs. Van Brugh for her past.|$|E
2500|$|Pirate Guybrush Threepwood boasts to two pirates {{about the}} time he {{defeated}} LeChuck. He further tells them that he is looking for the treasure of [...] "Big Whoop", and for a ship to take him there. The pirates tell Guybrush that Largo LaGrande, LeChuck's former first mate, has placed an embargo on the island, and is not allowing any ships to enter or leave. Guybrush wanders into Woodtick, the only town on the island, and encounters Largo, who promptly robs him of all of his money and takes off. Wandering the island, Guybrush comes across the International House of Mojo, the Voodoo Lady's new shop. She offers to help him drive Largo off the island <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> her some ingredients for a voodoo doll. After retrieving the needed ingredients, Guybrush, with the voodoo doll that Voodoo Lady makes for him, defeats Largo. However, in trying to prove that {{he was the one who}} killed LeChuck, Guybrush makes the mistake of showing Largo LeChuck's beard, which he had kept as a trophy. Largo then steals the beard and uses it to resurrect his old boss, this time as a zombie. The Voodoo Lady reveals to Guybrush that Big Whoop, the mythical treasure for which he is searching, is also the key to another dimension which will allow him to escape from LeChuck forever. In addition, she gives him a library book about Big Whoop which reveals that a map, made by the original discoverers of the treasure, still exists in four fragments.|$|E
