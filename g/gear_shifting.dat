In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E

40|$|Currently, most hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) equipped with automated mechanical transmission (AMT) are implemented with the conventional two-parameter <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule based on engineering experience. However, this approach cannot {{take full advantage}} of hybrid drives. In other words, the powertrain of an HEV is not able to work at the best fuel-economy points during the whole driving profile. To solve this problem, an optimization method of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule for HEVs is proposed based on Dynamic Programming (DP) and a corresponding solving algorithm is also put forward. A <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule that can be employed in real-vehicle is extracted from the obtained optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> points by DP approach and is optimized based on analysis of the engineering experience in a typical Chinese urban driving cycle. Compared with the conventional two-parameter <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule in both simulation and real vehicle experiments, the extracted <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule is proved to clearly improve the fuel economy of the HEV...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} in passenger vehicles {{has become more}} important due to the significant increase of fuel cost and the {{awareness of the environmental}} impact. Thus finding optimal speed profiles and <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategies to cover a distance in order to decrease fuel consumption is an important issue. The optimization problem is presented and solved by means of dynamic programming and using a quasistatic vehicle model approach. Different models are presented in order to solve the problem with different assumptions. For one model the <b>gear</b> <b>shifts</b> are assumed to be instantaneous, and for another model used the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> maneuver requires a certain time. For the second model, the influence of taking into account a realistic way to compute the losses during a <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> maneuver is also developed and studied. Comparing the results provided by the two models, this method to compute the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> losses in the optimization problem has influence in the optimal speed profiles compared to the models that do not take into account losses during the <b>gear</b> <b>shift.</b> There are two engine models used in this project, a Willans approximatio...|$|R

25|$|Innovative hollow double-gear {{input shaft}} allows quick shifts. The DCT {{is made up}} of two dry clutches, each fitted with {{electric}} motor-driven clutch actuator to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project.|$|E
500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; the number on the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while the number on the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E

David Browne from Entertainment Weekly described the importance the song held for Carey's musical transition.

[...] He felt [...] "Honey" [...] sounded as [...] "anyone striking out {{on his or her}} own — caught between old and new habits and taking cautious baby steps into the future." [...] Browne also commented that Carey showed a commendable vocal restraint in the song, [...] "showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into the downy-soft beats of [...] "Honey." [...] Author Chris Nickson felt the single's importance was [...] "well beyond its chart placing" [...] and that the single {{was one of the most}} important songs in Carey's career, enabling her to transition into R and hip-hop. Nickson commented that before, Carey was seen as a pop singer with R tendencies, but [...] "Honey" [...] changed that idea, giving the singer [...] "hip-hop credibility", and forced naysayers to [...] "take another look." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant complimented the song, calling it [...] "awakening, both sensually and musically." [...] Juzwiak concluded the review writing [...] "Honey exemplifies the abrupt <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> that appreciating Mariah the artist requires. Its new pop brilliance doesn't always come easy, where detecting it depends on the audience's newfound ability to apply Carey's pop life to her pop music." [...] "Honey" [...] was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremony, for Best Female R Vocal Performance and Best R Song. The song did not win either nomination, a typical trend of Carey's nominations at the Grammys.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{designing}} optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> {{strategies for}} conventional passenger {{vehicles equipped with}} discrete ratio transmissions. In order to study quantitatively an optimal trade-off between the fuel economy and the driveability, the vehicle driveability is addressed in a fuel-optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> algorithm based on dynamic programming by three methods: method 1, weighted inverse of power reserve; method 2, constant power reserve; method 3, variable power reserve. Furthermore, another method based on stochastic dynamic programming is proposed to derive an optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategy {{over a number of}} driving cycles in an average sense, hence taking into account the vehicle driveability. In contrast with the dynamic-programming-based strategy, the obtained <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategy based on stochastic dynamic programming is real time implementable. A comparative analysis of all proposed <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> methods is given in terms of the improvements in the fuel economy and the driveability. The variable-power-reserve method achieves the highest fuel economy without sacrificing the driveability...|$|R

They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no <b>gear</b> <b>shifting,</b> they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a manual effort to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.|$|E

A number of factors are responsible for this: the relatively light weight of the C5 (a curb weight under Chevrolet {{went so far as}} to omit the spare tire as a weight-saving measure, relying upon run-flat tires instead); the C5's low drag coefficient; and the vehicle's tendency to upshift into the higher gears as soon as possible. The manual transmission's Computer-Aided <b>Gear</b> <b>Shifting</b> results in an obligatory shift from 1st gear directly into 4th gear under certain driving conditions; the system can be deactivated through the use of an aftermarket device.|$|E
