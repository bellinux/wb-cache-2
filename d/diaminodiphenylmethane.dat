50|$|The {{aromatic}} polyurethane and urea type crosslinker {{is one of}} {{the significant}} reasons why many cathodic electrocoats show high levels of protection against corrosion. Of course {{it is not the only}} reason, but if one compares electrocoating compositions with aromatic urethane crosslinkers to analogous systems containing aliphatic urethane crosslinkers, consistently systems with aromatic urethane crosslinkers perform significantly better. However, coatings containing aromatic urethane crosslinkers generally do not perform well in terms of UV light resistance. If the resulting coating contains aromatic urea crosslinks, the UV resistance will be considerably worse than if only urethane crosslinks can occur. A disadvantage of aromatic urethanes is that they can also cause yellowing of the coating itself as well as cause yellowing in subsequent topcoat layers. A significant undesired side reaction which occurs during the baking process produces aromatic polyamines. Urethane crosslinkers based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) can be expected to produce toluene diamine as a side reaction, whereas those based on Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate produce <b>diaminodiphenylmethane</b> and higher order aromatic polyamines. The undesired aromatic polyamines can inhibit the cure of subsequent acid catalysed topcoat layers, and can cause delamination of the subsequent topcoat layers after exposure to sunlight. Although the industry has never acknowledged this problem, many of these undesired aromatic polyamines are known or suspected carcinogens.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The kinetics and mechanism of curing of a multicomponent thermosetting system based on tetraglycidyl- 4, 4 ' <b>diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (TGDDM) and N,N'-bismaleimido- 4, 4 'diphenylmethane (BMI), cured {{in the presence of}} 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), has been investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It has been shown that two chemically distinct networks are formed upon curing, the one being due to the homopolymerization of BMI and the other to the addition reaction between TGDDM and DDS. Dynamic-mechanical measurements suggested that, despite the different growing rates of the two networks, they are highly interpenetrated and form a single phase, molecularly homogeneous system.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest of using microwave technology for curing resins. The heating of the epoxy resins greatly relies on various factors which includes the dielectric properties, kind of waveguide used and the frequency and power used. The majority of curing via microwaves were normally performed on epoxy resins like diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) with hardeners like 4, 4 ’ <b>diaminodiphenylmethane</b> (DDM). This paper investigates the experimental use of materials such as Casting Resin ADR 2512, High Temperature Resin ADR 2515 and Laminating Resin GPR 2516. Two high temperature hardeners were used together with the resins, mainly ADH 2403 and ADH 2409. Microwave curing resulted in a shorter curing time to reach the maximum percentage cure. Two moulding techniques were studied, mainly curing by placing the mould in the cavity or by preheating the resins prior to pouring the resin into the mould.

Epoxy systems modified with 4 %, 8 %, and 12 % (by wt) of polyethersulfone {{were made by}} using epoxy resin (DGEBA) and polyethersulfone with <b>diaminodiphenylmethane</b> as curing agent. The polyethersul-fone-toughened epoxy systems were further modified with 4 %, 8 %, and 12 % (by wt) of bismaleimides, namely 1, 3 -bismaleimiobenzene and 1, 10 -bis(4 -maleimidophenyl) cyclohexane. BMI-PES–Epoxy matrices were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and heat deflection temperature (HDT) analysis. The DSC thermograms of polyethersulfone-modified epoxy and BMI-modified epoxy during cure show unimodal reaction exotherms. The studies indicate that thermal stability and resistance to water absorption of epoxy resin has been enhanced {{by the introduction of}} polyethersulfone. The incorporation of bismaleimide into unmodified epoxy and PES–epoxy enhanced the thermal and mechanical properties according to its percentage content.

The isothermal curing kinetics measured by DSC were well represented with the generalized auto-catalytic reaction model. With the temperature sweep, the inverse rela-tionship between complex viscosity measured by RMS and ionic conductivity obtained from DEA was estab-lished indicating that the mobility of free ions represented by the ionic conductivity in DEA measurement and the chain segment motion as revealed by the complex viscosity measured from RMS are equivalent. From iso-thermal curing measurements at several different temperatures, the ionic conductivity contribution was shown to be dominant in the dielectric loss factor at the early stage of cure. The contribution of the dipole relaxation in dielectric loss factor became larger as the curing further proceeded.

The curing exotherm could be resolved from the decomposition exotherm qualitatively using DTA-TG analysis. The DMA has been carried out in both the dynamic and isothermal mode to follow the curing process of the systems DGFCH/DDM and TGVTCH/DDM. The storage modulus (G^'), loss modulus (G^'^'), complex viscosity (η) and creep factor (tan δ) were measured simultaneously. The crossover point of G^' and G^'^', taken as the gelation point in isothermal runs, was determined to obtain time to gelation at that temperature. The isothermal runs at different temperatures have been used to calculate activation energy of the curing process up to gelation. For the difunctional resin DGFTCH, the activation energy value was found to be 18. 7 kcal/mol. The thermomechanical analysis (TMA) has been used to find the glass transition (T_g 0), and melt transition (T_m) temperatures.

Among them, the water barrier property of LeTs makes them very promismg materials for the potential applications in electronics and coatings. Liquid crystalline monomer, 4, 4 '-diglycidyloxy-a-methylstilbene (DOMS), was synthesized and cured with different crosslinking agents, such as sulphanilamide, diaminodiphenylsulfone, <b>diaminodiphenylmethane,</b> and 2, 4 -Diaminotoluene. LeTs with different liquid crystalline structures were produced and their structural, dynamic mechanical and permeability properties are characterised. The conventional epoxy monomer, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (BADGE) is also involved in our study and resins formed by BADGE and curing agents are used as comparisons to the DOMS LeT systems. Polarized optical microscopic tests were used to form time-temperature-transition (TTT) diagrams for different systems, which provide important information about the curing process of Lf. Ts. Relationships between curing conditions, structure and properties are created by TTT diagrams and microscopic observations. Differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle X-ray scattering tests demonstrated the typical smectic features of LeTs systems. In the dynamic vapour sorption tests, the extraordinary water barrier property of smectic LeT is revealed. The water permeability of LeT was reduced by 74. 6 % at 65 'C and by 63. 7 % at 85 'C in comparison with the conventional thermoset. Smectic Le structure was proven useful in reducing the water permeation in epoxy thennosets. Dynamic mechanical analysis combined with computer modelling was employed to investigate the correlation between water permeation and inner structure of materials to clarify the mechanism of moisture diffusion and sorption in LCTs.
