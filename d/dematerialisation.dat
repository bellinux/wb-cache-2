25|$|The Master, {{played by}} Roger Delgado, makes his first {{appearance}} in Terror of the Autons (1971), where he allies with the Nestene Consciousness to help them invade Earth. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) convinces the Master to stop this plan at the last minute, and the Master subsequently escapes, albeit with his TARDIS, a space-time ship, left non-functioning after the Doctor confiscates the ship's <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{symbolic}} start-date for {{the collection}} is 1968, but it refers specifically to the socio-cultural events {{of the second half}} of the 1960s which, in addition to consecration of pop art, witnessed the launch of the bases of <b>dematerialisation</b> of art works, mingling of formal genres, the use of film, photography and text to underpin conceptual projects and blurring of the lines between art and life, accompanied by widespread agitation for new political and social ideas. In Portugal, the late 1960s paved the way to the experimentalism of the 1970s and the beginning of a dialogue that was more informed by international experiences and relationships between Portuguese artists and their foreign counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} stage show based on the comedy show Bottom written by Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, Richie is {{concerned}} about Eddie, whom he hasn't seen for weeks. [...] As it turns out, Eddie has been busy with his latest invention: a time travelling toilet which he names the Turdis. [...] The ship's <b>dematerialisation</b> noise consists of the original TARDIS sound effect with the noise of flatulence and flushing toilets mixed in, and {{it can only be}} recharged when someone masturbates inside it.|$|E
2500|$|The End of Time {{marked the}} last {{appearance}} of the Master until 2014, when the character was brought back as a woman with no explanation given {{at the time as}} to how he escaped Gallifrey or what prompted his regeneration. Four years later, Simm reprised the role for the show's first ever [...] "multi-Master" [...] story, [...] "World Enough and Time"/"The Doctor Falls" [...] (2017), which caught up with Simm's Master shortly before his regeneration. In the story, the Master is posing as a menial worker on the basement floor of a Mondasian colony ship, helping to bring the Cybermen into existence anew. When the Doctor appears aboard the ship with the Master's own future incarnation, he meets his successor, Missy (Michelle Gomez), who is struggling between her nature and a promise to reform her ways. In the second part, the two Masters pair off as friends, but Missy's loyalties remain divided between the Doctor and her old self. The Master explains to the Doctor that the Time Lords [...] "cured" [...] his condition from The End of Time and expelled him from Gallifrey; he set himself up as a ruler on the Mondasian colony ship after his TARDIS broke, before being overthrown and hatching a new Cyberman-related plan. He and Missy plan to abandon the Doctor on the ship using Missy's spare <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit to repair his TARDIS, but Missy decided, at the last, to stand alongside the Doctor. She stabs her past self, giving him enough time to reach his TARDIS before he will regenerate. In return, he shoots her with his laser screwdriver to prevent himself from ever siding with the Doctor, promising to have disabled her regenerative abilities. He leaves his future self to die, and returns to his TARDIS, where he will soon forget having met his future self.|$|E

"Science {{can make}} no {{use of the}} {{substance}} of intellectual revelations, but must be guided by observed facts and by the conclusions logically and mathematically uniting them"--a passage which is quoted with approval by Professor Reichel, and {{would seem to be}} endorsed by the silence concerning the religious side of the question which is observed by most of our great scientific supporters. It is a point of view which can well be understood, and yet, closely examined, it would appear to be a species of enlarged materialism. To admit, as these observers do, that spirits do return, that they give every proof of being the actual friends whom we have lost, and yet to turn a deaf ear to the messages which they send would seem to be pushing caution to the verge of unreason. To get so far, and yet not to go further, is impossible as a permanent position. If, for example, in Raymond's case we find so many allusions to the small details of his home upon earth, which prove to be surprisingly correct, is it reasonable to put a blue pencil through all he says of the home which he actually inhabits? Long before I had convinced my mind of the truth of things which appeared so grotesque and incredible, I had a long account sent by table tilting about the conditions of life beyond. The details seemed to me impossible and I set them aside, and yet they harmonise, as I now discover, with other revelations. So, too, with the automatic script of Mr. Hubert Wales, which has been described in my previous book. He had tossed it aside into a drawer as being unworthy of serious consideration, and yet it also proved to be in harmony. In neither of these cases was telepathy or the prepossession of the medium a possible explanation. On the whole, I am inclined to think that these doubtful or dissentient scientific men, having their own weighty studies to attend to, have confined their reading and thought to the more objective side of the question, and are not aware of the vast amount of concurrent evidence which appears to give us an exact picture of the life beyond. They despise documents which cannot be proved, and they do not, in my opinion, sufficiently realise that a general agreement of testimony, and the already established character of a witness, are themselves arguments for truth. Some complicate the question by predicating the existence of a fourth dimension in that world, but the term is an absurdity, as are all terms which find no corresponding impression in the human brain. We have mysteries enough to solve without gratuitously introducing fresh ones. When solid passes through solid, it is, surely, simpler to assume that it is done by a <b>dematerialisation,</b> and subsequent reassembly--a process which can, at least, be imagined by the human mind--than to invoke an explanation which itself needs to be explained.|$|E

The Doctor contacts the Master, offering to return his <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit {{in exchange for the}} missile. The Master agrees on condition he will come alone. But the Doctor uses Barnham to transport the Keller Machine to the airfield and turn the Mind Parasite loose on the Master. With the Master helpless, the Doctor is able to trigger the missile's self-destruct circuit and the Thunderbolt and the Keller Machine are destroyed. The Master uses the chaos to escape with his <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit, killing Barnham in the process. He contacts the Doctor by telephone to taunt him that he is now free while the Doctor remains trapped in his exile on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Berríos-Negrón's social {{pedestals}} take environmental form {{as their}} medium. In {{parallel to the}} works of contemporary artists such as Mark Leckey that take the <b>dematerialisation</b> of sculpture {{as part of the}} digitalisation of life, in the case of Berríos-Negrón’s work, his temporary works often contend with <b>dematerialisation</b> as part of the geopolitics of climate change or forced migration. These time-based works are conditioned by things that at first glance could be dispassionately thought of as ordinary things, such as ropes, tables, chairs, carpets, book shelves, archives, and so forth. Berríos-Negrón believes that these things only begin to work as social pedestals when activated by collective engagement. As part of his own culture and education, Berríos-Negrón points to Brazilian and Latin American Neo-concrete art and to “transculturation”, as well as to North American Interrogative Design and Second-Order Cybernetics.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the book}} Doctor Who: Companions by David J. Howe and Mark Stammers, the final episode of the serial was to have {{included}} a cameo appearance by William Russell and Jacqueline Hill reprising their roles as former companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. The scene had Ian and Barbara witnessing the <b>dematerialisation</b> of the TARDIS after Dodo enters. Although the scene was scheduled, it was not filmed.|$|E
50|$|Immobilisation {{entails the}} use of {{securities}} in paper form and {{the use of}} a Central Securities Depository or more than one, which is/are electronically linked to a settlement system. Securities (either constituted by paper instruments or represented by paper certificates) are immobilised {{in the sense that they}} are held by the depository at all times. In the historic transition from paper-based to electronic practice, immoblisation often serves as a transitional phase prior to <b>dematerialisation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although a true analog freak, Navarro {{promotes}} free downloading {{of music}} on the Internet, recycling Luciano Floridi's neologism of ’infosphere (Dan Simmons) inspired by the concept of noosphere (the web of human minds that spawns {{the surface of the}} Earth) as put forth by Teilhard de Chardin. In an interview with Alain Brunet of Montreal's La Presse, evoking the inevitable and necessary <b>dematerialisation</b> of musical supports, he states: the infosphere … will absorb the noosphere. It will become the depository of knowledge and creation. (cf. external links).|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{electronic}} settlement, and a move to <b>dematerialisation</b> of securities, standardised clearing systems were required, as well as standardised securities depositories, custodians and registrars. Until this point, many exchanges would act as their own clearing house, however the additional computer systems required to handle large volumes of trades, {{and the opening of}} new financial markets in the 1980s, such as the 1986 big bang in the UK, led to a number of exchanges separating or contracting the clearing and settlement functions to dedicated organisations.|$|E
50|$|The Master then {{breaks into}} UNIT HQ in person. As a {{bargaining}} counter, the Doctor reveals {{that he has}} possession of the Master's <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit, and threatens to destroy it: but he is foiled {{by the presence of}} Jo, who the Master takes as a hostage. The Master takes both Jo and the Doctor to the quarry near the radio telescope, to force the Brigadier to abort a planned RAF airstrike on the Autons sheltering there. But Farrel, struggling to break free of his hypnosis, unexpectedly causes a diversion, and while the Master is busy subduing him the Doctor and Jo escape.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963 {{they were}} {{approached}} by composer Ron Grainer {{to record a}} theme tune for the upcoming BBC television series Doctor Who. Presented {{with the task of}} [...] "realising" [...] Grainer's score, complete with its descriptions of [...] "sweeps", [...] "swoops", [...] "wind clouds" [...] and [...] "wind bubbles", Delia Derbyshire created a piece of electronic music which has become one of television's most recognisable themes. Over the next quarter-century the Workshop contributed greatly to the programme providing its vast range of unusual sound-effects, from the TARDIS <b>dematerialisation</b> to the Sonic screwdriver, as well as much of the programme's distinctive electronic incidental music, including every score from 1980 to 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Moore also {{endorsed}} the American materialization medium Joseph Jonson from Toledo, Ohio.

Jonson was later exposed as a fraud by James Hewat McKenzie who discovered that Jonson's daughter had dressed up as a spirit. In 1907, Hereward Carrington attended séances with Jonson at Lily Dale, New York and concluded [...] "on several occasions, the fraud was very apparent, and that I was enabled to follow the process of materialisation and <b>dematerialisation</b> with ease. Everything was the most obvious and simple trickery, and seen to be such." ...|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{process of}} law or Electronic lawsuit is an {{up-to-date}} phenomenon, concerning the use of computer programs in courts and public departments in sue activities. It is a theme of worldwide scope. In Portugal, it {{is known as the}} concept of processo eletrônico. In India, known as Electronic Judicial Resource Management. In France, it is called <b>Dématerialisation</b> du processus judiciaire. It is a polissemic expression related to interdisciplinarity between the information technologies and branches of law that govern the lawsuits that take place in departments of public administration; more specifically, the control, follow-up, searches and practices of juridical acts helped by computer systems. Its universal definition can be found in various sources.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and {{the troops}} of UNIT are {{handling}} the security {{arrangements for the}} first World Peace Conference. Captain Chin Lee of the Chinese delegation, whose delegate leader is dead, is behaving strangely and attempting to heighten tension in relations with the United States. It emerges that her actions are {{under the influence of}} the Master. She uses the transmitted power of the Keller Machine against the American delegate, Senator Alcott, who barely survives the attack. Captain Chin Lee is deconditioned by the Doctor, and tells him that Emile Keller is in truth the Master, whom the Doctor has previously trapped on Earth by stealing the <b>dematerialisation</b> circuit of his TARDIS.|$|E
50|$|Non-DvP {{settlement}} processes typically {{expose the}} parties to settlement risk. They are known {{by a variety of}} names, including free delivery, free of payment or FOP delivery, or in the United States, delivery versus free. FOP settlement involves delivery of the securities without a simultaneous transfer of funds - hence 'free of payment'. Funds may either be remitted by other, mutually agreed means, or payment may not be made at all. This is the case in the transfer of securities gifted or inherited, or, in a country retaining paper securities certificates, in the <b>dematerialisation</b> of such securities, by transfer FOP into the name of the electronic custodian, with beneficial ownership retained by the transferor.|$|E
50|$|The {{symbolic}} start-date for {{the collection}} is 1968, but it refers specifically to the socio-cultural events {{of the second half}} of the 1960s which, in addition to consecration of pop art, witnessed the launch of the bases of <b>dematerialisation</b> of art works, mingling of formal genres, the use of film, photography and text to underpin conceptual projects and blurring of the lines between art and life, accompanied by widespread agitation for new political and social ideas.

50|$|All {{applicants}} {{should carry}} original documents for verification by an authorized {{official of the}} depository participant, under his signature.Further, the investor has to sign {{an agreement with the}} DP in a depository prescribed standard format, which details rights and duties of investor and DP. DP should provide the investor with a copy of the agreement and schedule of charges for their future reference. The DP will open the account in the system and give an account number, which is also called BOID (Beneficiary Owner Identification number).The DP may revise the charges by giving 30 days notice in advance. SEBI has rationalised the cost structure for <b>dematerialisation</b> by removing account-opening charges, transaction charges for credit of securities, and custody charges vide circular dated January 28, 2005.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, {{the digital}} {{revolution}} currently transforming the entire book world - from {{the creation of}} texts through to their marketing - could have significant impacts in terms of bibliodiversity. The <b>dematerialisation</b> of the book, the possibility of virtual communications with a much larger group of contacts / readers / buyers (via e-marketing, for example) might suggest that independent publishers and publishers in emerging markets {{have the potential to}} raise their profile. On the other hand, the capturing of this emerging marketplace (as yet unproven in economic terms) by new players - online sales platforms, designers and manufacturers of IT equipment (readers in particular), etc. - suggests that the publication production system will reconfigure without promoting greater bibliodiversity at the same time.|$|E
