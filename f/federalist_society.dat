40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at a panel on Justice Thomas and Article II at the Yale <b>Federalist</b> <b>Society’s</b> conference, 2 ̆ 2 Celebrating Justice Thomas: 25 Years on the Supreme Court. 2 ̆ 2 It addresses the question: 2 ̆ 2 How does Justice Thomas determine the original meaning of Article II of the U. S. Constitution? 2 ̆ 2 In answering this question, I make three observations based on opinions authored or joined by Justice Thomas. First, Justice Thomas seems much more inclined to theorize about executive power than other aspects of constitutional law. Second, Justice Thomas routinely cites seven key sources of original meaning in his decisions on executive power. Third, in deciding questions under Article II, Justice Thomas adheres to his general approach of seeking the original objective meaning of the Constitution, rather than some other form of original meaning. The practical conclusions from my observations are twofold. First, a litigator who hopes to persuade Justice Thomas in an Article II case should attempt to find support {{in a variety of}} historical sources. Second, the same litigator also should consider making arguments based on theories of executive power [...] such as those concerning the competence and authority of the President compared to Congress and the Courts [...] even though Justice Thomas generally decides other kinds of constitutional questions with a focus more on the text of the Constitution than on abstract principles...|$|R

50|$|After the American Revolution, many <b>Federalists</b> {{hoped that}} <b>society</b> would remain largely {{as it had}} been during the colonial era, but Jefferson wanted to upend the social order.

In a world in which few believed in democracy or egalitarianism, Jefferson's belief in political equality for white men stood out from many of the other Founding Fathers of the United States, who continued to believe that the rich and powerful should lead society.|$|R

2500|$|Controversy has {{attended}} Dean Scarnecchia's {{tenure at the}} law school, culminating in an editorial [...] in the Albuquerque Journal by Christina Hoff Sommers in October, 2006.

Furthermore, the editorial alleges, students who do not share the law faculty's political complexion frequently find themselves isolated and marginalized by the law faculty—who, for example, explicitly discourage students from joining the <b>Federalist</b> <b>Society.</b> Dean Scarnecchia, the editorial implied, {{played an important role in}} a recent decision wherein the faculty dissolved the [...] "DA Law Clinic", which allowed students to work with the District Attorney's Office.
