40|$|Reliability {{has been}} defined as 2 ̆ 2 worthy of {{dependence}} 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 of proven consistency in producing satisfactory results. 2 ̆ 2 It is a common concept as well as a quality for which individuals search in their everyday transactions, such as purchasing a car or selecting an express delivery service. It similarly shapes the rules of evidence pertaining to hearsay. Beth common law and modem evidentiary codes ban the admission of extrajudicial statements offered to prove the truth of a matter asserted because they are not made under oath, {{in the presence of the}} trier of fact, and subject to cross-examination. Without these safeguards, the trier of fact cannot evaluate the witness 2 ̆ 7 perception, memory, or narration, and therefore not the statement 2 ̆ 7 s reliability. Furthermore, the use of hearsay denies those against whom the statement is offered the opportunity to both challenge the information itself and confront its declarant. There are, however, instances in which evidence that otherwise would qualify as hearsay possesses sufficient indicia of reliability to merit admission. Some kinds of hearsay provide the trier of fact with a more accurate source of facts than a witness 2 ̆ 7 first hand remembrance of information, and therefore, an exception is made to the rule excluding hearsay. In other cases, exceptions are made because the hearsay has circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that, although not equivalent to in-court testimony, at least provide sufficient reliability so that admission is preferable to the loss of relevant evidence. The hearsay exception for <b>declarations</b> <b>against</b> <b>interest</b> falls into the latter category...|$|R
40|$|In Lilly v. Virginia, the Supreme Court {{once again}} has the {{opportunity}} to grapple with the meaning of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendmel). t. The basic facts of Lilly are simple, for they present the ageold problem of accomplice confessions. Three men, Gary Barker and Ben and Mark Lilly, went on a crime spree, during which one of them shot to death a young man they had robbed and kidnaped. Ben Lilly was charged with being the triggerman, and Barker testified to that effect at Ben 2 ̆ 7 s trial. Mark did not testify. But Mark had made a statement to the police shortly after the trio was apprehended, and he also identified his brother Ben as the triggerman. Mark 2 ̆ 7 s statement was introduced over Ben 2 ̆ 7 s objection. Ben was convicted. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the conviction, treating Mark 2 ̆ 7 s statement as a <b>declaration</b> <b>against</b> penal <b>interest,</b> 499 S. E. 2 d 522 (1998), and the U. S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. The case was argued on March 29, 1999...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{one hundred}} and fifty years ago, the North Carolina Supreme Court {{acknowledged}} the apparent absurdity of convicting one for a crime to which another had confessed extra-judicially without permitting introduction of that confession as proof of the accused 2 ̆ 7 s innocence. The emotional appeal of the court 2 ̆ 7 s statement notwithstanding, a majority of states have barred such confessions through their courts 2 ̆ 7 refusal to recognize the <b>declaration</b> <b>against</b> penal <b>interest</b> exception to the hearsay rule. While sound evidentiary theory buttresses the majority 2 ̆ 7 s position, at least from an historical perspective, the erosion of the hearsay rule, among other factors, has led a growing minority of states to adopt the penal interest exception in some form. Using the opportunity afforded by State v. Haywood (hereinafter Haywood), Chief Justice Sharp announced that in the future North Carolina will adhere to the growing minority 2 ̆ 7 s position by allowing admission of such declarations upon the satisfaction of specified conditions. Since the court decided Haywood on other grounds, the announcement was dicta; however, without a wholesale change in attitude, undoubtedly the principle of Haywood will become law.
