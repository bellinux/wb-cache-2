She was considered too short and the role went to actress Nia Long. Jada and Will became friends, and began dating in 1995. On December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Regarding her marriage, Jada said that they are [...] "private people" [...] and told one interviewer, [...] "I will throw my career away before <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> break up our marriage. I made it clear to Will. I'd throw it away completely".|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} the meaning behind [...] "Ugly", Fantasia {{said that she}} wanted to help someone, and said, [...] "My grandmother taught me that your test will help someone along the way." [...] During an interview with People, she explained that she intended for the track to reach [...] "every young girl out there who’s gonna go through everything I went through, and more" [...] as well as older women. Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> free onstage." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning I intended in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

500|$|Tavevele Noa was {{the sole}} male {{athletic}} competitor to compete for Tuvalu at the London Olympics {{at the age of}} 20. He had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Noa qualified for the Games by using a wildcard after competing in an event on Tuvalu's main island and was selected {{to take part in the}} men's 100 metres dash. In an interview before the Games he said he was looking to competing in the Olympics and felt nervous but aimed to establish a new personal best time. Noa was drawn in the second heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing sixth out of seven runners, with a time of 11.55 seconds. He finished ahead of Timi Garstang of the Marshall Islands (12.81 seconds) but behind Palau's Rodman Teltull (11.06 seconds) in a heat led by Jurgen Themen from Suriname (10.55 seconds). Overall Noa finished 72nd out of 76 participants and did not advance to the later stages after being 0.75 slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who progressed. After his event he stated: [...] "My race was not good, my aim was to get 10 seconds. The start of my race was good but then when I reached 60 meters, <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> down." ...|$|E

2500|$|All-Star National Basketball Association player Tim Hardaway drew {{criticism}} {{after he}} said on the [...] "790 the Ticket" [...] radio show, [...] "Well, you know, I hate gay people. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known I don't like gay people.

2500|$|World War I {{brought a}} crisis in his development. Military service {{disrupted}} his life when {{at the age of}} 42 he was in the army. He was never able to work uninterrupted or over a period of time, and as a result he left many unfinished works and undeveloped [...] "beginnings". On one occasion, a superior officer demanded to know if he was [...] "this notorious Schoenberg, then"; Schoenberg replied: [...] "Beg to report, sir, yes. Nobody wanted to be, someone had to be, so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be me" [...] (according to Norman , this is a reference to Schoenberg's apparent [...] "destiny" [...] as the [...] "Emancipator of Dissonance").|$|E
