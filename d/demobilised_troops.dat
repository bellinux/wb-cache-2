2500|$|Invicta was {{refitted}} {{ready for}} service, {{but she was}} bareboat chartered by the Government on 26 December 1945 {{for use as a}} troopship, repatriating <b>demobilised</b> <b>troops</b> from Calais to Dover. On 27 December she collided with [...] in Dover.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry {{addressed}} {{the issues of}} prolonged strike action by workers, {{many of whom were}} <b>demobilised</b> <b>troops.</b> 2.4 million British workers were involved in strike action in 1919, in what the government perceived {{as a threat to the}} development of the economy.|$|E
50|$|The Scala was {{originally}} {{built as a}} cinema to the designs of H Courtney Constantine, but construction was interrupted by the First World War and it spent some time being used to manufacture aircraft parts, and as a labour exchange for <b>demobilised</b> <b>troops</b> before opening in 1920 as the King's Cross Cinema. The cinema changed hands and names several times through its life and also changed focus, ranging from mainstream to art-house to adult film over 70 years, as well as spending a short time as a primatarium.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{there were}} 4,600 New Zealand troops {{stationed}} at the camp and it became a repatriation centre. At that time there was unrest in other camps as a result of delays in <b>demobilising</b> <b>troops.</b> To try to maintain order the [...] "spit and polish" [...] regime was enforced and route marches ordered. The men requested a relaxation of discipline as the war was over and they were far from home, however this was refused and the troops rioted, stealing food from the mess and all of the alcohol from the officers' mess.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{integration}} of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, weapons and ammunition shortages remained acute. Serious logistical difficulties arose from the parallel employment of Western and Soviet weaponry, which were of different gauges and calibres, often within the same battalion. In August 1981, a sabotage action most likely carried out by South African Special Forces or disgruntled Rhodesian servicemen destroyed most of Zimbabwe's ammunition stocks. Plans for future procurement were put on hold as the National Army (ZNA) was still <b>demobilising</b> <b>troops</b> and remained uncertain of future manpower levels or the amount of funding available for a replacement inventory. Nevertheless, senior officers in the ZNA took this opportunity to lobby for the acquisition of more weapons from domestic suppliers.|$|R
5000|$|Zhuge Liang met Sun Quan in Chaisang and {{proposed}} two solutions to him, [...] "If {{you can use}} the forces of Wuyue to resist the central government, why not break ties (with Cao Cao) in advance? If you cannot oppose, why not <b>demobilise</b> the <b>troops,</b> discard your armour and surrender to the north?" [...] After Sun Quan's viceroy, Zhou Yu, analysed the situation and pointed out weaknesses in Cao Cao's army, Sun finally agreed to ally with Liu Bei in resisting Cao Cao. Zhuge Liang returned to Liu Bei's camp with Sun Quan's envoy, Lu Su, to make preparation for the upcoming war.|$|R
50|$|In November 1999, Kiani was {{promoted}} to Lieutenant-General and took over the X Corps {{under the command of}} Lieutenant General Mahmud Ahmed. In 2001, he was made the General Headquarters (GHQ)s adjutant general. After he completed his term in GHQ, he was again given the command of X Corps. The X Corps again saw the action against Indian Army when, in late 2001, Indian Army launches the Operation Parakram. LTG Kiani, having a long career as an intelligence officer, commanded the X Corps posted in Azad Kashmir. In October 2002, both Indian and Pakistani governments had begun to <b>demobilise</b> their <b>troops</b> along their border and, in 2003, a cease fire pact was signed.|$|R
50|$|On 12 March 1794, General Antoni Madaliński, the {{commander}} of 1st Greater Polish National Cavalry Brigade (1,500 men) decided to disobey the order to <b>demobilise,</b> advancing his <b>troops</b> from Ostrołęka to Kraków. This sparked an outbreak of riots against Russian forces throughout the country. The Russian garrison of Kraków was ordered {{to leave the city}} and confront Madalinski, which left Kraków completely undefended, but also foiled Kosciuszko's plan to seize their weapons.|$|R
2500|$|Overy {{wrote that}} blitzkrieg as a [...] "coherent {{military}} and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend {{in light of the}} evidence". Milward's theory was contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions. The Germans, aware of the errors of the First World War, rejected the concept of organising its economy to fight only a short war. Therefore, focus was given to the development of armament in depth for a long war, instead of armament in breadth for a short war. Hitler claimed that relying on surprise alone was [...] "criminal" [...] and that [...] "we have to prepare for a long war along with surprise attack". During the winter of 1939–40, Hitler <b>demobilised</b> many <b>troops</b> from the army to return as skilled workers to factories because the war would be decided by production, not a quick [...] "Panzer operation".|$|R
50|$|Evidence from arrested co-conspirators {{led to the}} incarceration of Hamid II on 5 April. By 19 April, Hamid II had {{confessed to}} his {{involvement}} in the botched Jakarta coup and to planning an abortive second attack on Parliament scheduled for 15 February. Due to the presence of RUSI troops, the attack was aborted. The role of the Pasundan government in the coup led to its dissolution by 10 February, further undermining the federal structure. By late March 1950, Hamid's West Kalimantan was one of the four remaining federal states in the United States of Indonesia.Hamid's role in the coup led to increased agitation in West Kalimantan for its integration into the Republic of Indonesia. Following a fact-finding mission by the Government Commission, the RUSI House of Representatives voted by fifty votes to one to merge West Kalimantan into the Republic of Indonesia. Following clashes with <b>demobilised</b> KNIL <b>troops</b> in Makassar and the attempted secession of an Ambonese Republic of South Moluccas, the federal United States of Indonesia was dissolved on 17 August 1950, turning Indonesia into a unitary state dominated by the central government in Jakarta.|$|R
