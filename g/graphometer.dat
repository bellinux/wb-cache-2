Much is known about Danfrie's life and activities. He is probably best known as designer of the surveying instrument known as the <b>graphometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|To measure an angle, say, EKG, {{place the}} {{diameter}} middle C at the angle apex K using the plummet at point C of the instrument. Align the diameter with leg KE of the angle using the sights {{at the ends}} of the diameter. Align the alidade with the leg KG using another pair of sights, and read the angle off the limb as marked by the alidade. Further uses of the <b>graphometer</b> are the same as those of the circumferentor.|$|E
50|$|An {{expedition}} to Vanikoro in 1999 dived on the wrecks of Boussole and Astrolabe, finding a <b>Graphometer</b> {{similar to one}} found at Numbo in 1885. This follows finds of a silver fork with the coat of arms of Fleuriot de Langle, a Louis d'or, Spanish and Russian coins, an alcohol thermometer, a ship's whistle, part of a bilge pump, an anchor, a cask of dragon, a crucifix, a human statue, ship's débris, a copper sieve, musket balls, an engraved domino, bottles, pitchers, goblets, trivial trade items and officers' medals and high collars.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the theodolite, {{instruments}} such as {{the geometric}} square and various graduated circles (see circumferentor) and semicircles (see <b>graphometer)</b> were used to obtain either vertical or horizontal angle measurements. It {{was only a matter}} of time before someone put two measuring devices into a single instrument that could measure both angles simultaneously. Gregorius Reisch showed such an instrument in the appendix of his book Margarita Philosophica, which he published in Strasburg in 1512. It was described in the appendix by Martin Waldseemüller, a German topographer and cartographer, who made the device in the same year. Waldseemüller called his instrument the polimetrum.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>graphometer,</b> {{semicircle}} or semicircumferentor is a {{surveying instrument}} used for angle measurements. It {{consists of a}} semicircular limb divided into 180 degrees and sometimes subdivided into minutes. The limb is subtended by the diameter with two sights at its ends. In {{the middle of the}} diameter a [...] "box and needle" [...] (compass) is fixed. On the same middle the alidade with two other sights is fitted. The device is mounted on a staff via a ball and socket joint. In effect the device is a half-circumferentor. For convenience, sometimes another half-circle from 180 to 360 degrees may be graduated in another line on the limb.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of studying the effects of technological parameters of milling upon surface roughness and microhardness of C 45 steel objects after laser cutting. The metallographic structure formed as an effect of cutting by laser was also analyzed. The milling was performed on a FV- 580 a vertical machining centre. Depth of cut and feed per tooth were changed within the following range: ap = 0. 09 – 0. 18 mm and fz = 0. 02 – 0. 17 mm/tooth. To measure the surface roughness a Surtronic 3 + profile <b>graphometer</b> was used, whereas microhardness was measured {{with the use of a}} Leco LM 700 AT microhardness tester. The surface roughness was significantly improved as a result of milling. The laser beam input and output zones were eliminated. Only a part of the layer hardened by laser cutting was removed while milling, in effect of which after milling the hardness of surface layer is much higher than hardness of the core...|$|E
40|$|Conjugate eye {{deviation}} (CED) is {{a striking}} symptom following hemispheric stroke. However, the term “eye deviation” describes {{only a part of}} the symptom: a sustained shift of the patient’s horizontal eye-in-head position towards the lesioned side. Observing carefully, one recognises that the patient’s head is also orientated towards the side of the brain lesion in most cases. Such a simultaneous deviation of eye and head positions is described more precisely by the term “Gaze deviation” (GD). Up to now, the pathophysiology of GD remains unclear. In this context, a relationship between GD and spatial neglect is object of controversial discussions. The aim {{of the present study was}} to clarify whether or not there is a systematic relation between both symptoms. We investigated an unselected sample of 33 consecutively admitted patients with unilateral first-ever stroke. The patient sample consisted of 16 patients with right hemispheric stroke (RBD) and 17 patients with left hemispheric stroke (LBD). In addition, 15 non-brain-damaged control subjects (CON) were investigated. Patients were examined with respect to (i) their spontaneous orientation of gaze and (ii) spatial neglect. Examinations were carried out in the early state of disease, i. e. in an interval of 0 - 3 days after stroke. To allow a reliable diagnosis of gaze deviation, we used a quantitative method for the assessment of horizontal eye-in-head and head-on-trunk positions. Eye-in-head positions were recorded by electrooculography while the head-on-trunk positions were measured by a <b>graphometer</b> circle. Spatial neglect was diagnosed in 24 % of patients. All of them suffered from a strong deviation of gaze. A gaze deviation of similar extent was not observed in any other group of patients. There was a substantial difference between the mean horizontal gaze position of neglect patients versus patients without neglect and healthy controls. The results of the present study indicate a close relation between gaze deviation and spatial neglect. This finding has clinical implications. So far, it was difficult to derive the diagnosis of spatial neglect in the early state of the stroke since patients are severely impaired and not able to perform standardised paper-and-pencil tests. In need of a first estimation it might be helpful for clinical neurologists to consider that right hemispheric stroke patients who suffer from a marked deviation of gaze (i. e. > 30 °) most probably also suffer from spatial neglect. Schlaganfälle der Großhirnhemisphären gehen mit verschiedenen Symptomen einher. Ein häufiges und auffälliges Symptom ist die konjungierte Blickdeviation (gaze deviation, GD). Patienten mit einer Blickdeviation zeigen eine spontane Wendung der Augen zur Seite der geschädigten Hemisphäre sowie eine Orientierung des Kopfes zur selben Seite. Die Pathophysiologie dieses Symptoms ist noch unklar. Umstritten ist insbesondere eine Beziehung der Blickdeviation zur Neglectsymptomatik. Ziel dieser Studie war es daher zu klären, ob es eine Beziehung zwischen diesen Symptomen gibt. Im Zeitraum von neun Monaten untersuchten wir alle Schlaganfallpatienten mit erstmaligem, unilateralen Schlaganfall. Bei 16 von diesen 33 Patienten betraf der Schlaganfall die rechte Hemisphäre (right brain damaged, RBD). 17 Patienten hatten eine Läsion der linken Hemisphäre (LBD). Wir untersuchten zusätzlich 15 Kontrollenpersonen ohne Hirnschädigung (controls, CON). Die Untersuchung fand 0 - 3 Tage nach Beginn der Symptomatik statt. Sie umfasste eine Messung der spontanen Augen- und Kopfposition sowie Tests zur Diagnose von Neglect. Die spontane Augenposition wurde mittels Elektrookulographie ermittelt, die Kopfposition wurde mit einem Winkelmesser bestimmt. Insgesamt 24 % der Patienten hatten einen Neglect. Gleichzeitig zeigte jeder dieser Patienten eine ausgeprägte Blickdeviation, die in dieser Stärke in keiner anderen Patientengruppe beobachtet werden konnte. Die mittlere Blickposition aller Neglectpatienten unterschied sich signifikant von der Blickposition der Patienten ohne Neglect und der Patienten ohne Hirnschädigung. Dieser Befund deutet auf eine enge Beziehung zwischen Blickdeviation und Neglect hin. Daraus ergeben sich Konsequenzen für die Diagnostik von Neglect. Sie war bisher im akuten Stadium des Schlaganfalls nur schwer möglich, da die Patienten zu stark beeinträchtigt sind, um konventionelle Papier-und-Bleistift Verfahren zu bearbeiten. Für eine frühzeitige klinische Einschätzung der Neglectsymptomatik kann es daher hilfreich sein zu wissen, dass rechshemisphärisch geschädigte Patienten mit einer starken Blickdeviation (größer als 30 °) mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Neglectsymptomatik aufweisen...|$|E
