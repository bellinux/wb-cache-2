50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>control</b> is the {{management}} of the rotational speed of an electric fan. In computers, various types of computer fans are used to provide adequate cooling, and different <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms balance their cooling capacities and noise they generate.|$|E
50|$|Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> however is {{the easiest}} and most {{efficient}} option for modern motherboards which have PWM fan headers. PWM <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> rapidly cycles between feeding the fan full voltage and no voltage to control rotational speed. Typically the motherboard chipset provides temperature data from sensors on the CPU itself to control speed.|$|E
50|$|To {{change the}} <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> policy, updates to the {{embedded}} controller's firmware are usually necessary. In some systems, <b>fan</b> <b>control</b> is not {{provided by the}} embedded controller, but is instead done by a higher-level component such as an ACPI controller. In this case, changing the behaviour of the fan system {{can be done by}} the system administrator through ACPI configuration without changing any firmware.|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} is energy savings and reduced wear. VAV <b>fan</b> <b>control,</b> especially with modern electronic variable-speed drives, reduces the energy consumed by fans, {{which can be}} a substantial part of the total cooling energy requirements of a building. Modulating control of the compressor also reduces wear and delivers further energy savings.|$|E

50|$|Resistors are the {{simplest}} method of reducing fan noise, but they {{add to the}} heat generated inside the computer case. Since the voltage drop {{is proportional to the}} current, the fan may not start. They need to be of the appropriate power rating. For variable <b>fan</b> <b>control,</b> potentiometers could be used along with a transistor such as a MOSFET whose output voltage is controlled by the potentiometer. It is possible to use a rheostat instead.|$|E
50|$|In {{this style}} of <b>fan</b> <b>control,</b> the fan is either on or off. Temperature inside the chassis is checked, and if an outside-of-range {{temperature}} is detected, fans are set to their maximum speed. When the temperature drops below a threshold again, the fans are turned back off. This control method reduces noise issues and power requirements during periods of low usage, but when the system is operating at capacity, the fan noise can become a problem again.|$|E

40|$|Drilling {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} large {{petroleum}} reserve in the Liushagang Formation of the Fushan Depression, South China Sea from reservoirs of the sublacustrine fans. To reduce the risk associated with exploration, the sedimentary characteristics of the sublacustrine fans should be identified and described. Analysis of the drilling cores, well data and 3 D seismic data was conducted to identify and interpret the sublacustrine fans which formed in a lacustrine succession as the low-stand fan of the 2 nd member of Liushagang Formation (SQEls 2). The reservoirs were commonly associated with pebbly conglomerates, mudstone shivers, muddy debris, various deformation structures including micro-faults, liquified deformation structure, ball and pillow structure, slump and stress-release deformation. Further contrastive analysis of sedimentary characteristics and palaeogeomorphology between the western and eastern sublacustrine fans indicates that they belong to two different types of sublacustrine system in continental basins. More specifically, the western <b>fan,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the multi-level step-fault belt, is a typical gravel-rich sublacustrine system which is characterised by structurally controlled, high gradient (2. 8 - 3. 3 °), admixtures of muddy debris and pebbly conglomerates and poor reservoir quality, while the eastern <b>fan,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the flexure slope-break belt, is a sand-rich sublacustrine system dominated by relatively low gradient (2. 0 - 2. 5 °), general fining-upwards trend with good reservoir quality. Therefore, the development of future exploration should be conducted at different levels in the Fushan Depression...|$|R
