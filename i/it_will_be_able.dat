To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property but the question remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people {{have chosen not to}} report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to escape. This hope {{is not part of the}} present.

During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC, which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running.

500|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire plays {{similarly}} to traditional pinball games, using a similar engine to its predecessor, Pokémon Pinball. It features two boards, each themed on either Pokémon Ruby or Sapphire. They have similar layouts, though they feature some differences, the Sapphire table being noted as slightly more annoying {{due to its}} setup. The player launches a ball onto the board, at which point it descends towards the bottom of said board. The objective {{is to ensure that}} the ball does not reach the pit at the bottom. Players must utilize a pair of flippers located right above the bottom to hit the ball upward, keeping it from falling for as long as possible. There are two spots located on either end of the board where the ball may fall, rendering players helpless. A Pikachu sits at either side of the board, and if players have filled its meter, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to shoot the ball out of this spot. Under certain conditions, a Pichu will appear, allowing both spots to be blocked. This only occurs when the player has activated the four circles that sit in both the side slots and flipper paths, shown here. Consequently, a gravity field appears in the central hole that starts a [...] "Start Slot" [...] minigame that resembles a slot machine. In the blue field the player is able to utilise a Zigzagoon (shown here {{on the right side of}} the board) so that it can pounce on the selected tile and obtain the result.|$|E
