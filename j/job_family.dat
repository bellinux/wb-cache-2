5000|$|The model builds {{from the}} vision, values and {{strategic}} business {{priorities of the}} organization and includes the following competency layers: Core Competencies - The Core competencies includes very general/generic competencies that all employees must possess to enable the organization to achieve its mandate and vision (e.g., Teamwork). These competencies describe in behavioral terms the key values of the organization and represent those competencies that are core to the organization’s principal mandate <b>Job</b> <b>Family</b> Competencies - <b>Job</b> <b>Family</b> competencies are those competencies that are common {{to a group of}} jobs. They often include General Job competencies that tend to be required in a number of Job Families (e.g., Partnering), as well as Job Specific competencies that apply to certain job families more than others (e.g., Project Management). These tend to be related more to knowledge or skill required for certain types of jobs (e.g., Accounting for jobs involving financial administration) [...] Technical / Professional Competencies - The technical/professional competencies tend to be specific to roles or jobs within the <b>Job</b> <b>Family,</b> and include the specific skills and knowledge (know-how) to perform effectively (e.g. ability to use particular software; knowledge in particular professional areas such as finance, biochemistry; etc.). These competencies could be generic to a <b>Job</b> <b>Family</b> as a whole, or be specific to roles, levels or jobs within the family. [...] Leadership Competencies - These are the key competencies for roles in an organization that involve managing, supervising or influencing the work of others in some way. Some organizations view [...] "leadership" [...] {{to be a part of}} every job of the organization in that employees are expected to contribute and offer new or better ways of working regardless of their level or role in the organization. Leadership is required in teams, project management, as well as at the managerial, executive and board levels. Consistent with the requirement for ease of use, organizations typically define a limit on the number of key / important competencies that are included in the profile for any job / role within the organization. As a rule of thumb, best practice organizations establish a limit on the total number of competencies included in any one profile in the range of 12 to 15.|$|E

It was predicted that the relationships between age and accident frequency and severity would differ depending upon job context. The study also examined the extent to which progressive selection was a factor. 7, 131 accidents that occurred over a five year span in a large Southwestern petrochemical facility were analyzed. In addition, information about age and employment history was obtained for the 3, 015 employees at this plant. There were no differences in the proportions of employees in different age groups across <b>job</b> <b>families</b> indicating progressive selection was not a factor in this workforce. Younger workers had higher overall accident rates than older employees; but there were few differences between them in the proportion of severe accidents incurred.

50|$|The {{guidelines}} {{break the}} sentencing down even further based on mitigating and aggravating circumstances. There {{is a set}} sentence, or presumptive sentence, that is the standard {{for a person to}} be sentenced, but they could receive more or less based on different factors. These factors are mitigating and aggravating. Mitigating factors could be anything from time at a <b>job,</b> <b>family</b> situation, or different actions that were taken after committing the crime that will look good and act in their favor, such as anger management classes or substance abuse classes. These different situations will be used in court to make a persons situation more desirable, and the judge can then use these circumstances to move the person into the mitigating category of punishments. The over side of that is the aggravating factors. These could include if the person has not followed through with court recommendations, or if the defendant does not have a job or any sort of history of stability in their life. The different factors are the main area that a judge can adjust a sentence, although for the most part people will receive the presumptive sentence.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{scheduling}} of lots (jobs) of different product types (job families) on parallel machines, where not all machines are able (i. e. are qualified) to process all job families (non-identical machines). This {{is known in}} the literature as scheduling with machine eligibility restrictions. A special time constraint, associated with each <b>job</b> <b>family,</b> should be satisfied for a machine to remain qualified for processing a <b>job</b> <b>family.</b> This constraint imposes {{that there must be}} at most a given time interval (threshold) between processing two jobs of the same <b>job</b> <b>family,</b> on a qualified machine. A machine is considered to be qualified to process a certain job if and only if, at a given time instant t, the time threshold corresponding to the <b>job</b> <b>family</b> of the job is not violated. This problem comes from semiconductor manufacturing, when Advanced Process Control constraints are considered in scheduling problems, as for example in the photolithography area. To solve this problem, a Time Indexed Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was proposed and solved in a previous paper. A new adapted model will be provided in this paper. A bicriteria objective function, that includes scheduling and qualification criteria, is considered. Dedicated heuristics are proposed.
