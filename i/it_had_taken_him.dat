His dismembered body {{would later be}} found in a lake located near the entrance to the Herrenhausen Gardens. Haarmann would confess that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> four separate trips to carry de Vries's dismembered remains—carried in the bag which had belonged to Friedrich Koch—to the location he had disposed of them.|$|E
25|$|In January 1941, he was {{appointed}} a flight commander of No. 41 Squadron RAF. With the squadron he flew fighter sweeps and bomber escort sorties over Nazi occupied France. On 14 August 1941, he was flying over France escorting bombers whose target was the St Omer railyards near Lille. One of the Blenheim bombers was attacked by two Messerschmitt 109 fighters. He went to its aid, shooting {{down one of the}} Messerschmitts. However, in the dogfight with the remaining Nazi fighter, his spitfire sustained damage and burst into flames. He was forced to bale out at a low altitude from his out of control aircraft. He landed safely and a French farmer immediately ushered him to a cornfield where he hid until nightfall. The farmer' son, Felix Caron, then arrived to bring him to the safety of their farm in Saint-Folquin. On 25 August 1941, his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to war substantive flying officer with seniority in that rank from 15 August 1941. After two weeks in a French Resistance safe house, the French speaking Winskill was moved down the Pat Line. He travelled to the Pyrenees and then, via Andorra, Barcelona and Madrid, to British Gibraltar. He arrived back in England in December 1941; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> three months to arrive back in England after being shot down.|$|E
500|$|After {{development}} of the original [...] was finished, the writer and director Shu Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Development of the game began immediately when Takumi returned to work from his vacation: the producer, Atsushi Inaba, called him in to a meeting, and told Takumi that he wanted him to write the script for five episodes before the game went into full production, with a deadline of {{three and a half}} months. Takumi thought that this was [...] "completely insane", as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> an average of more than a month to write each of the four episodes for the first Ace Attorney; additionally, he felt {{that he did not have}} any [...] "tricks" [...] left to use for mysteries or any story threads to work off of. He wanted to protest, but still ended up having to do it. As soon as he returned to his desk, he drafted a work schedule: he scheduled two and a half month to write the dialogue, with half a month per episode, leaving him with a month to create the first prototype and figure out the [...] "tricks" [...] to be used in the mysteries. He doubted that he would be able to do it in time, but managed to write the whole script by the deadline. However, due to issues with memory on the game's cartridge, one episode ended up having to be cut from the game; it was later used as the third episode of the third game.|$|E

The dirt road {{represents}} working hard in life in contrast to walking on the a paved road which is considered [...] "easy street." ...|$|R

40|$|Stephen King’s The Dark Tower {{series was}} {{finished}} {{with the publication of}} the seventh volume in 2004. Counting almost four thousand pages in total, this series is Stephen King’s magnum opus and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> thirty years to complete it. When he first started out writing the story, his intention was nothing more than to write a story that was “[ [...] . ] the largest popular novel in history” (King 2003 a, XIV) ...|$|R
500|$|... 15 August was a Sunday, {{and thus}} a rest day. Play resumed on Monday, the second morning, and Morris {{registered}} his third century of the Test series and his sixth in ten Ashes matches. Overall, it was his seventh century in 14 Tests. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> 208 minutes and he had hit four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller came in and tried to attack, but made only five before overbalancing and stumbling forward out of his crease, allowing Evans to stump him from the bowling of Hollies. Harvey, the youngest player in the Australian squad at the age of 19, came to the crease at 243/4 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another boundary, but the attacking strokeplay did not last. Harvey succumbed to Hollies, hitting him to Young. The young batsman was having trouble against the turning ball, so he decided to use his feet and step towards the pitch of the ball. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Hollies' success against the middle-order prompted Yardley to opt to continue with the older ball even when a replacement was available, a move that was rarely made throughout the series as the pacemen dominated the bowling. Hollies did not spin the ball significantly but relied on variations in flight to defeat his opponents.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Mattis {{ordered the}} 3:00a.m. {{bombing of a}} {{suspected}} enemy safe house near the Syrian border, which later {{came to be known}} as the Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre, and which resulted in the deaths of 42 civilians. Mattis stated that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> 30 seconds to deliberate on whether or not to bomb the location. Describing the wedding as implausible, he said, [...] "How many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles (130km) from the nearest civilization? These were more than two dozen military-age males. Let's not be naive." [...] The Associated Press obtained video footage appearing to show a wedding party, although the occurrence of a wedding was disputed by military officials.|$|E
2500|$|With Chappell again available, Hughes {{returned}} to the vice-captaincy for the 1981–82 Tests. Australia played Pakistan first in an ill-tempered three Test series; won by the Australians two Tests to one. Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered {{the best team in}} the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. [...] Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling. In an interview later he said [...] "that to hang around and defend was going to be a waste of time...So I thought what I could do was try to play as many shots as possible." [...] When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes' remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn't give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes' innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said [...] "He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don't find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion. That was just his day." [...] The Wisden 100, a ranking of the Top 100 Test Innings of all time, ranked that innings as number nine.|$|E
50|$|From then {{until now}} he has worked hard, mainly in Mexico, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> 10 years {{to get back to}} Paris to exhibit his artwork. In December 2010 Sergio was invited to by the Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts to join the {{international}} art show 'Salon 2009 Carrousel du Louvre'. It was a dream come true for him when he showed his symbolist abstract bronze sculpture 'Semiotica' down the crystal pyramid of the Louvre Museum.|$|R

5000|$|February 17, 1847: Woodworth's launch {{arrives at}} Sutters Fort; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> 11 days, {{fighting}} against {{the wind and the}} strong current of the swollen Sacramento River. He leaves the same day for Johnson's Ranch, the staging point of the rescue effort. Patrick Breen's diary: [...] "Froze hard last night with heavy clouds running from the N.W. & light showers of hail at times. To day same kind of Weather. Wind N.W. Very cold & Cloudy. No sign of much thaw." ...|$|R
6000|$|All this {{he took in}} at a {{comprehensive}} glance that consumed no more time than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to say good-morning. To that good-morning Pantaloon replied in a bellow: ...|$|E
60|$|He broke off, for, to {{the accompaniment}} of a shout of {{approval}} from the two spectators, Arthur had swung his right fist, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> smartly {{on the side of the}} head.|$|E
60|$|And {{then he went}} on, {{and told}} us how <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> {{half an hour to}} land it, and how it had broken his rod. He said he had weighed it {{carefully}} when he reached home, and it had turned the scale at thirty-four pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not again! I am {{speaking}} seriously now. Mr. Penrose {{looked at}} me with a strange kind of interest--I can't describe <b>it.</b> <b>Have</b> you <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> into our confidence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bolton {{must have}} {{reminded}} him of his oversight, for after being gone so long as <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to walk to her parlour and back, he returned, and said simply, [...] "I forgot Idella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he did," [...] Francis said; [...] "but {{he would}} have been a hundred miles further north by daybreak, and <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> a couple of days to get back to where we were lying." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> but a {{very short}} time to make himself at home in the regiment. The men {{sometimes}} looked at him with surprise, he was so different from themselves. They bore their hardships well, but it was with stern faces and grim determination; while this young soldier made a joke of them.|$|E
60|$|I tipped {{him several}} more, {{and he was}} in great spirits. We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> a good many years to bring the {{property}} up to its present pitch of perfection.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile Deronda relaxed {{his hold}} on his mathematics, and Hans, {{reflecting}} on this, at length said: [...] "Old fellow, while you are hoisting me you are risking yourself. With your mathematical cram one may be like Moses or Mahomet or somebody of that sort who had to cram, and forgot in one day what <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> forty to learn." ...|$|E
5000|$|James Berardinelli {{writing for}} ReelViews, called Rescue Dawn, [...] "a solid effort from Herzog that {{fans of the}} genre should {{actively}} seek out" [...] and noted that [...] "Herzog understood when he made Little Dieter Needs to Fly that the ex-pilot's story would make an excellent feature. <b>It's</b> surprising <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> so long to make that movie." [...] Berardinelli also commented that [...] "Christian Bale continues to amaze with his ability and range. He {{may be the most}} versatile under-40 performer today. No role seems to be beyond him, and he has worked with some of the best directors of his era".|$|R
60|$|Well, shall I {{continue}} the tail? If Mr. Dawkins {{had been the}} least bit wiser, <b>it</b> would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> six months befoar he lost his money; as it was, {{he was such a}} confunded ninny, that it <b>took</b> <b>him</b> a very short time to part with it.|$|R
60|$|He was {{swimming}} energetically but unskilfully. He {{appeared to be}} one of those men who can look after themselves in the water only when they are in bathing costume.

60|$|Arthur was {{not doing}} badly. He was at least keeping them straight. And in the {{circumstances}} straightness was to be preferred to distance. Soon after leaving Little Hadley he had become ambitious and had used his brassey with disastrous results, slicing his fifty-third into the rough {{on the right of}} the road. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> ten with the niblick to get back on to the car tracks, and this had taught him prudence.|$|E
60|$|With what pride {{he showed}} us over his ship, the sailors gaping at the fine young lady. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> just a day to {{institute}} his navy discipline. And Dolly went about exclaiming, and asking an hundred questions, and merrily catechising me upon {{the run of the}} ropes. All was order and readiness for dropping down the stream when he led us into his cabin, where he had a bottle of wine and some refreshments laid out against my coming.|$|E
60|$|Mark slept {{but little}} that night. He had {{believed}} {{all along that}} he should be finally successful, but the discovery had come so suddenly that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> completely by surprise. It might not be the man, and he tried hard to persuade himself that the chances were against his being so, so that he should not feel disappointed should it turn out that it was some other criminal, for that the man was a criminal he had not a shadow of doubt.|$|E
60|$|That <b>it</b> should <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> three strokes to hole {{out from}} this {{promising}} position was unfortunate, but not fatal, for Gossett, who seemed suddenly {{to have fallen}} off his game, only reached the green in seven. A moment later a murmur of approval signified the fact that Archibald had won his first hole.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> R. Jones {{just six}} hours to {{discover}} Joan Valentine's address. That <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> longer is a {{proof of his}} energy and of the excellence of his system of obtaining information; but R.

60|$|In {{his study}} he consoled himself for this {{diminution}} of his intention. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> five years, he reflected, {{to get to}} his present real sense of God's presence and to his personal subordination to God's purpose. It had been a little absurd, he perceived, to expect these girls to leap at once to a complete understanding of the halting hints, the allusive indications of the thoughts that now possessed his soul. He tried like some maiden speaker to recall exactly what it was he had said and what it was he had forgotten to say.... This was merely a beginning, merely a beginning.|$|E
60|$|The hamper was {{so heavy}} and large, and Jean-Marie himself so little and so weary, that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> a great while to bundle it {{upstairs to the}} Desprez' private room; and he had just set {{it down on the}} floor in front of Anastasie, when the Doctor arrived, and was closely {{followed}} by the man of business. Boy and hamper were both in a most sorry plight; for the one had passed four months underground in a certain cave on the way to Acheres, and the other had run about five miles as hard as his legs would carry him, half that distance under a staggering weight.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not set}} me down till we were at {{the front}} door. We were both wet through, cold, and spent, and it was past nine, so long as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to labour on in the tempest. Eustace came out grumbling in his petulant way at our absence from dinner. I don't think either of us could bear it just then: Harold went up to his room without a word; I stayed to tell that he had seen me home from church, and say a little about the fearful weather, and then ran up myself, to give orders, as Mr. Yolland had advised me, that some strong hot coffee should be taken at once to Harold's room.|$|E

Oliver becomes territorial over Carmella and he grows jealous of Marco. Rosenfeld said [...] "Marco is withholding a secret that could bring into question his motives for dating Carmella."

50|$|On {{his first}} day in the Army Dodo is sent to non {{commissioned}} officer school but after a brief time he returns to inform the officers that as he proficiently demonstrated his knowledge of military regulations {{he was ordered to}} sew on First Sergeant chevrons and return to his unit. This infuriates the now outranked Ames as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> twenty years to make buck sergeant. Sgt Ames sees his chance for revenge when he insists Dodo is put in charge of the worst and most chaotic company on the camp: Company F. The soldiers try to make things hard for Dodo, by following his orders to the letter. When Dodo orders his company to report for training in overcoats, rifles and full packs, the men fall out only wearing these items with no other clothing. As soon as Sergeant Ames hears this he reports it to Major Greer, hoping it will shorten Dodo's career as a non commissioned officer.|$|R
