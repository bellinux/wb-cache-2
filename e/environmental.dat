5|$|<b>Environmental</b> {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of <b>environmental</b> problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in <b>environmental</b> sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which <b>environmental</b> problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable <b>environmental</b> sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern <b>environmental</b> sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. <b>Environmental</b> sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her books, Palmer has written or co-written over 30 articles in peer-reviewed journals and over 25 articles in scholarly collections, as well as various encyclopedia articles and book reviews. Editorial duties have included acting as an associate editor for Callicott and Robert Frodeman's two-volume encyclopedia <b>Environmental</b> Philosophy and Ethics and editing the journal Worldviews. Palmer {{has served on the}} editorial boards of two Springer series (first, the International Library of <b>Environmental,</b> Agricultural and Food Ethics, and, second, Ecology and Ethics) and one Sydney University Press series: Animal Publics. She has served on the editorial boards of various journals, including <b>Environmental</b> Humanities; Ethics, Policy and Environment; <b>Environmental</b> Ethics; <b>Environmental</b> Values; the Journal of Agricultural and <b>Environmental</b> Ethics; and the Journal for the Study of Religion, Culture and Nature.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol on <b>Environmental</b> Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also {{known as}} the <b>Environmental</b> Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main {{instrument}} concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on <b>environmental</b> and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for <b>Environmental</b> Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} coauthored by Australian <b>environmental</b> science {{researchers}} Haydn Washington and John Cook. Washington worked for over 30 {{years as an}} <b>environmental</b> scientist prior to writing the book. His previously published {{books on the subject}} of <b>environmental</b> science include: Ecosolutions (1991), A Sense of Wonder (2002), and The Wilderness Knot (2009). In 2015, Washington was a Visiting Fellow with the Institute of <b>Environmental</b> Studies at the University of New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and <b>environmental</b> organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National <b>Environmental</b> Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an <b>environmental</b> impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the <b>Environmental</b> Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s <b>environmental</b> movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, <b>environmental</b> management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and <b>environmental</b> degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in <b>environmental</b> legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized <b>environmental</b> movements after the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} and environments {{are necessary to}} the survival of humans and other organisms. Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering, <b>environmental</b> resources management and <b>environmental</b> protection. Information is gained from green chemistry, earth science, <b>environmental</b> science and conservation biology. Ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Environmental</b> Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer {{examines}} whether process philosophy, {{in particular}} the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in <b>environmental</b> ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined <b>environmental</b> ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to writing on process {{approaches to the}} environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian <b>environmental</b> ethics more broadly, urban <b>environmental</b> ethics, and scholarship on the environment {{in the work of}} English writers. Much of her work in <b>environmental</b> ethics has explored questions concerning animals, including the tension between protecting individuals and protecting species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, <b>environmental</b> policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, <b>environmental</b> pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several <b>environmental</b> protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current <b>environmental</b> issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

25|$|The Ministry of the Environment {{holds the}} <b>environmental</b> {{responsibilities}} in Brazil. One of its associated institutions is Ibama, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, {{which is in}} charge of executing the <b>environmental</b> policies dictated by the Ministry regarding <b>environmental</b> licensing; <b>environmental</b> quality control; authorization of the use of natural resources; and <b>environmental</b> monitoring and control among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Environmental</b> {{engineering}} is the contemporary term for sanitary engineering, though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included {{much of the}} hazardous waste management and <b>environmental</b> remediation work covered by <b>environmental</b> engineering.

25|$|Ecological {{resilience}} and the thresholds by which resilience is defined are closely interrelated {{in the way}} that they influence <b>environmental</b> policy-making, legislation and subsequently <b>environmental</b> management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of <b>environmental</b> impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem resilience, some levels of <b>environmental</b> impact associated with development are made permissible by <b>environmental</b> policy-making and ensuing legislation.|$|E
25|$|The National <b>Environmental</b> Education Act of 1990 {{requires}} EPA {{to provide}} national leadership to increase <b>environmental</b> literacy. EPA established the Office of <b>Environmental</b> Education to implement this program.|$|E
25|$|The New York State Department of <b>Environmental</b> Conservation Police (NYSDEC Police or NYSENCON Police), {{is the law}} {{enforcement}} agency of the New York State Department of <b>Environmental</b> Conservation.

25|$|In 1973, the Pureland Association {{was formed}} and Declaration of <b>Environmental</b> Standards were {{established}} and recorded in Gloucester County, New Jersey. Approximately 1,200 acres {{were placed in}} an <b>environmental</b> reserve in perpetuity and rigid <b>environmental</b> controls were established, prior {{to the establishment of}} the <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency or the New Jersey Department of <b>Environmental</b> Protection. These restrictive covenants protect property owners' value and are enforced by the Pureland Association which consist of property owners.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{joining the}} Bush Administration, Connaughton was {{a partner in}} the law firm Sidley Austin, in its <b>Environmental</b> Practice Group, dealing with {{corporate}} <b>environmental</b> compliance. From 1993 until 2001, Connaughton served as one of the lead U.S. negotiators of the ISO 14000 series of international <b>environmental</b> management and performance consensus standards, including standards on <b>environmental</b> labeling. Connaughton also worked with officials from U.S. EPA, California EPA, and the <b>Environmental</b> Law Institute to help form the Multi-State Work Group on <b>Environmental</b> Management Systems ("MSWG").|$|E

25|$|For {{her efforts}} <b>environmental</b> {{degradation}} and desertification, Jibrell {{has received a}} number of awards. In 2002, she was presented the Goldman <b>Environmental</b> Prize, the most prestigious grassroots <b>environmental</b> award. In 2008, she also won the National Geographic Society/Buffett Foundation Award for Leadership in Conservation. Additionally, Jibrell received the 2014 United Nations <b>Environmental</b> Programme (UNEP) Champions of the Earth award for her <b>environmental</b> conservation work.|$|E
25|$|To address <b>environmental</b> concerns, Hydro-Québec {{established}} an <b>environmental</b> protection committee in 1970 and an <b>Environmental</b> Management unit in September 1973. Its mandate is {{to study and}} measure the <b>environmental</b> effects of the company, prepare impact assessment, and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities, while conducting research projects in these areas, {{in cooperation with the}} scientific community.|$|E
25|$|The USGS collaborates with Canadian and Mexican {{government}} scientists, {{along with}} the Commission for <b>Environmental</b> Cooperation, to produce the North American <b>Environmental</b> Atlas, {{which is used to}} depict and track <b>environmental</b> issues for a continental perspective.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, public {{consciousness}} about <b>environmental</b> threats grew rapidly. Large scale <b>environmental</b> disasters {{such as the}} Chernobyl catastrophe focused attention {{on the need for}} higher levels of <b>environmental</b> protection. Issues such as the holes in the ozone layer over the poles and global warming prompted an acceleration in European <b>environmental</b> policy-making and institution-building.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{conducted}} by the <b>Environmental</b> Protection Administration under the Executive Yuan and the TCG Department of <b>Environmental</b> Protection have shown that noise levels are within regulations. To mitigate <b>environmental</b> damage, construction pillars and excavation were minimized.|$|E
25|$|The Aral Sea {{disaster}} {{is only the}} most visible indicator of <b>environmental</b> decay, however. The Soviet approach to <b>environmental</b> management brought decades of poor water management and lack of water or sewage treatment facilities; inordinately heavy use of pesticides, herbicides, defoliants, and fertilizers in the fields; and construction of industrial enterprises without regard to human or <b>environmental</b> impact. Those policies present enormous <b>environmental</b> challenges throughout Uzbekistan.|$|E
25|$|The Dirección General de Asuntos Ambientales (DGAA) of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MEM) is {{responsible}} for addressing <b>environmental</b> problems that result from energy and mining activities and is mandated to implement the laws and regulations of the <b>environmental</b> legal framework, such as Legislative Decree No. 613 of September 1990 (the <b>environmental</b> code) and Supreme Decree No. 016-93-EM of April 28, 1993 (the <b>environmental</b> regulation). The sustainable development model for the mining and energy sectors began in 1993 with regulations and procedures for the gradual reduction of pollution, which include economic development policies and <b>environmental</b> protection. The mining industry must comply by adjusting its ongoing operations to permissible effluent levels and its new operations by using cleaner technologies. The DGAA evaluates and proposes the <b>environmental</b> regulations for the mining and energy sectors, which include the maximum emission levels that are compatible with the internationally accepted limits set by the United Nations and the World Bank, approves <b>environmental</b> impact assessments for new operations and <b>environmental</b> adjustment and management programs for ongoing ones, and administers the national <b>environmental</b> information system. The MEM is authorized to manage <b>environmental</b> affairs in the minerals sector, such as establishing the <b>environmental</b> protection policy and maximum allowable levels for effluents, signing <b>environmental</b> administrative stability agreements, overseeing the impact of operations determining responsibilities, and imposing administrative sanctions. The oil companies, in particular, are under pressure {{because the number of}} operations in the Amazon Rainforest, one of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems, is increasing.|$|E

25|$|The IOC has 4 major {{approaches}} to addressing <b>environmental</b> health concerns during {{the construction and}} competitions of the Olympic Games. First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with <b>environmental</b> health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games. Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on <b>environmental</b> health issues like air quality and <b>environmental</b> impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare “pledges” to address specific or general <b>environmental</b> health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing <b>environmental</b> health objectives. Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches {{in an attempt to}} minimize the negative <b>environmental</b> health concerns of a host city.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{progressive}} {{leaders in}} the Republican party supported <b>environmental</b> protection. Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies {{eventually led to the}} creation of the National Park Service. While Republican President Richard Nixon was not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the <b>Environmental</b> Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive <b>environmental</b> program. However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who labeled <b>environmental</b> regulations a burden on the economy. Since then Republicans have increasingly taken positions against <b>environmental</b> regulation.|$|E
