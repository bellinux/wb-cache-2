40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ezatiostat</b> {{hydrochloride}} liposomes for injection, a glutathione S-transferase P 1 - 1 inhibitor, {{was evaluated}} in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The objectives were {{to determine the}} safety, pharmacokinetics, and hematologic improvement (HI) rate. Phase 1 - 2 a testing of <b>ezatiostat</b> {{for the treatment of}} MDS was conducted in a multidose-escalation, multicenter study. Phase 1 patients received <b>ezatiostat</b> at 5 dose levels (50, 100, 200, 400 and 600 mg/m 2) intravenously (IV) on days 1 to 5 of a 14 -day cycle until MDS progression or unacceptable toxicity. In phase 2, <b>ezatiostat</b> was administered on 2 dose schedules: 600 mg/m 2 IV on days 1 to 5 or days 1 to 3 of a 21 -day treatment cycle. Results 54 patients with histologically confirmed MDS were enrolled. The most common adverse events were grade 1 or 2, respectively, chills (11 %, 9 %), back pain (15 %, 2 %), flushing (19 %, 0 %), nausea (15 %, 0 %), bone pain (6 %, 6 %), fatigue (0 %, 13 %), extremity pain (7 %, 4 %), dyspnea (9 %, 4 %), and diarrhea (7 %, 4 %) related to acute infusional hypersensitivity reactions. The concentration of the primary active metabolites increased proportionate to <b>ezatiostat</b> dosage. Trilineage responses were observed in 4 of 16 patients (25 %) with trilineage cytopenia. Hematologic Improvement-Erythroid (HI-E) was observed in 9 of 38 patients (24 %), HI-Neutrophil in 11 of 26 patients (42 %) and HI-Platelet in 12 of 24 patients (50 %). These responses were accompanied by improvement in clinical symptoms and reductions in transfusion requirements. Improvement in bone marrow maturation and cellularity was also observed. Conclusion Phase 2 studies of <b>ezatiostat</b> hydrochloride liposomes for injection in MDS are supported by the tolerability and HI responses observed. An oral formulation of <b>ezatiostat</b> hydrochloride tablets is also in phase 2 clinical development. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 00035867 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Treatment {{options for}} {{patients}} with lower risk non-del(5 q) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who fail erythroid stimulating agents are restricted {{to one of the}} hypomethylating drugs with an expected response rate of ~ 50 %. <b>Ezatiostat</b> HCl, an agent with the potential for producing multi-lineage responses in this population is currently in clinical investigation phase. This case report describes a 77 year old male who received less than two cycles of therapy with <b>ezatiostat</b> HCl which had to be aborted due to intolerable side effects, but which produced a sustained normalization of all three blood counts. This trilineage response has now lasted for more than a year. Interestingly, the patient began with a del(5 q) abnormality and responded briefly to lenalidomide. Upon relapse of the anemia, a bone marrow showed the disappearance of the del(5 q) but the appearance of a new clonal abnormality t(2; 3). Given that the patient had a complete cytogenetic response to a truncated exposure to lenalidomide followed by a trilineage response to an even briefer course of <b>ezatiostat</b> HCl suggests a potential role for <b>ezatiostat</b> HCl in del(5 q) patients who relapse following lenalidomide. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ezatiostat,</b> a {{glutathione}} S-transferase P 1 - 1 inhibitor, {{promotes the}} maturation of hematopoietic progenitors and induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Results <b>Ezatiostat</b> {{was administered to}} 19 patients with non-deletion(5 q) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at one of two doses (2000 [*]mg or 2500 [*]mg/day) in combination with 10 [*]mg of lenalidomide on days 1 – 21 of a 28 -day cycle. No unexpected toxicities occurred and the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) were consistent with that expected for each drug alone. The most common non-hematologic AEs related to <b>ezatiostat</b> in combination with lenalidomide were mostly grade 1 and 2 fatigue, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting; hematologic AEs due to lenalidomide were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. One of 4 evaluable patients (25 %) in the 2500 / 10 [*]mg dose group experienced an erythroid hematologic improvement (HI-E) response by 2006 MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Four of 10 evaluable patients (40 %) in the 2000 [*]mg/ 10 [*]mg dose group experienced an HI-E response. Three of 7 (43 %) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent patients became RBC transfusion independent, including one patient for whom prior lenalidomide monotherapy was ineffective. Three of 5 (60 %) thrombocytopenic patients had an HI-platelet (HI-P) response. Bilineage HI-E and HI-P responses occurred in 3 of 5 (60 %), 1 of 3 with HI-E and HI-N (33 %), and 1 of 3 with HI-N and HI-P (33 %). One of 3 patients (33 %) with pancytopenia experienced a complete trilineage response. All multilineage responses were observed in the 2000 / 10 [*]mg doses recommended for future studies. Conclusions The tolerability and activity profile of <b>ezatiostat</b> co-administered with lenalidomide supports the further development of <b>ezatiostat</b> in combination with lenalidomide in MDS and also encourages studies of this combination in other hematologic malignancies where lenalidomide is active.

40|$|Abstract Idiopathic chronic {{neutropenia}} (ICN) {{describes a}} heterogeneous group of hematologic diseases characterized by low circulating neutrophil levels {{often associated with}} recurrent fevers, chronic mucosal inflammation, and severe systemic infections. The severity and risk of complications, including serious infections, are inversely proportional to the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), with the greatest problems occurring in patients with an ANC of less than 0. 5 × 10 9 /L. This case report describes a 64 -year-old female with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis who subsequently developed ICN with frequent episodes of sepsis requiring hospitalization and prolonged courses of antibiotics over a 4 -year period. She was treated with granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) but had a delayed, highly variable, and volatile response. She {{was enrolled in a}} clinical trial evaluating the oral investigational agent <b>ezatiostat.</b> <b>Ezatiostat,</b> a glutathione S-transferase P 1 - 1 inhibitor, activates Jun kinase, promoting the growth and maturation of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. She responded {{by the end of the}} first month of treatment with stabilization of her ANC (despite tapering and then stopping G-CSF), clearing of fever, and healing of areas of infection. This ANC response to <b>ezatiostat</b> treatment has now been sustained for over 8 months and continues. These results suggest potential roles for <b>ezatiostat</b> in the treatment of patients with ICN who are not responsive to G-CSF, as an oral therapy alternative, or as an adjunct to G-CSF, and further studies are warranted. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Approximately 70 % of all {{patients}} with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) present with lower-risk disease. Some {{of these patients}} will initially respond to treatment with growth factors to improve anemia but will eventually cease to respond, while others will be resistant to growth factor therapy. Eventually, all lower-risk MDS patients require multiple transfusions and long-term therapy. While some patients may respond briefly to hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, the majority will not, and new therapeutic options are needed for these lower-risk patients. Our previous clinical trials with <b>ezatiostat</b> (<b>ezatiostat</b> hydrochloride, Telentra&# 174;, TLK 199), a glutathione S-transferase P 1 - 1 inhibitor in clinical development {{for the treatment of}} low- to intermediate-risk MDS, have shown significant clinical activity, including multilineage responses as well as durable red-blood-cell transfusion independence. It would be of significant clinical benefit to be able to identify patients most likely to respond to <b>ezatiostat</b> before therapy is initiated. We have previously shown that by using gene expression profiling and grouping by response, it is possible to construct a predictive score that indicates the likelihood that patients without deletion 5 q will respond to lenalidomide. The success of that study was based in part {{on the fact that the}} profile for response was linked to the biology of the disease. Methods: RNA was available on 30 patients enrolled in the trial and analyzed for gene expression on the Illumina HT 12 v 4 whole genome array according to the manufacturer&# 8217;s protocol. Gene marker analysis was performed. The selection of genes associated with the responders (R) vs. non-responders (NR) phenotype was obtained using a normalized and rescaled mutual information score (NMI). Conclusions: We have shown that an <b>ezatiostat</b> response profile contains two miRNAs that regulate expression of genes known to be implicated in MDS disease pathology. Remarkably, pathway analysis of the response profile revealed that the genes comprising the jun-N-terminal kinase/c-Jun molecular pathway, which is known to be activated by <b>ezatiostat,</b> are under-expressed in patients who respond and over-expressed in patients who were non-responders to the drug, suggesting that both the biology of the disease and the molecular mechanism of action of the drug are positively correlated...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{significant}} advances {{have been made}} in the treatment of patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).   Although best supportive care continues to have an important role in the management of MDS, todate the therapeutic approach is diversified according to IPSS risk group, karyotype, patient’s age, comorbidities, and compliance. Hematopoietic growth factors play a major role in lower risk MDS patients, and include high dose erithropoiesis stimulating agents, which were shown to prolong survival, and thrombopoietic receptor agonists. Standard supportive care should also include iron chelating therapy to reduce organ damage related to iron overload in transfusion-dependent patients. Biologic therapies have been introduced in MDS, with lenalidomide, which has been shown to induce transfusion independence in most patients with the 5 q- Syndrome.  Hypomethylating agents have shown efficacy in INT- 2 /high risk MDS patients, reducing the risk of leukemic transformation and increasing survival. Other agents under development for the treatment of MDS include histone deacetylase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, clofarabine and <b>ezatiostat...</b>|$|E
