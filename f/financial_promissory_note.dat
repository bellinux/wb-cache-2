40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to provide an {{overview}} of the debtor's defense against the securing <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> misuse. This concerns both available preventive measures executable before the issue of the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> and subsequent legal motions in the civil contentious proceedings, decision enforcement, insolvency and redemption proceedings.

The first chapter deals with a brief theoretical introduction of the applicable laws, securing <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> abstract nature and appropriate {{purpose of the}} securing <b>promissory</b> <b>note.</b> The incomplete instruments and ownership transfers issues are also covered.

50|$|A <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> is {{very similar}} to a loan. Each is a legally binding {{contract}} to unconditionally repay a specified amount within a defined time frame. However, a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> is generally less detailed and rigid than a loan contract. For one thing, loan agreements often require repayment in installments, while <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> typically do not. Furthermore, a loan agreement usually includes the terms for recourse in the case of default, such as establishing the right to foreclose, while a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> does not. Also, while a loan agreement requires signatures from both the borrower and the lender, a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> only requires the signature of the borrower.|$|R
50|$|When {{a company}} engages {{in many of}} such transactions, for {{instance}} by having provided services to many customers all of whom then deferred their payment, {{it is possible that}} the company may be owed enough money that its own liquidity position (i.e., the amount of cash it holds) is hampered, and finds itself unable to honour their own debts, despite the fact that by the books, the company remains solvent. In those cases, the company has the option of asking the bank for a short term loan, or using any other such short term financial arrangements to avoid insolvency. However, in jurisdictions where <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> are commonplace, the company (called the payee or lender) can ask one of its debtors (called the maker, borrower or payor) to accept a <b>promissory</b> <b>note,</b> whereby the maker signs a legally binding agreement to honour the amount established in the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> (usually, part or all its debt) within the agreed period of time. The lender can then take the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> to a <b>financial</b> institution (usually a bank, albeit this could also be a private person, or another company), that will exchange the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> for cash; usually, the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> is cashed in for the amount established in the <b>promissory</b> <b>note,</b> less a small discount. Once the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> reaches its maturity date, its current holder (the bank) can execute it over the emitter of the note (the debtor), who would have to pay the bank the amount promised in the note. If the maker fails to pay, however, the bank retains the right to go to the company that cashed the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> in, and demand payment. In the case of unsecured <b>promissory</b> <b>notes,</b> the lender accepts the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> based solely on the maker's ability to repay; if the maker fails to pay, the lender must honour the debt to the bank. In the case of a secured <b>promissory</b> <b>note,</b> the lender accepts the <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> based on the maker's ability to repay, but the note is secured by a thing of value; if the maker fails to pay and the bank reclaims payment, the lender has the right to execute the security.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis {{is to provide a}} view into most {{significant}} modes of <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> abusive conduct. This view consists of thorough analysis of sources, modes of operation, impacts and available prevention of issues related to <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> and bill of exchange abuse. The domestic case law has been the primary source of the thesis. However, relevant literature and applicable laws have been reflected as well. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter deals with a brief historical introduction of the law of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> and its deviations from private law concerning especially the ones related to <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> abusive conduct. The current situation in the field of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> in Czech Republic is also reviewed in this chapter. The second chapter is focused on the abstract nature of obligations arising from the <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> as from negotiable instruments. Furthermore, excessive claims based on security <b>promissory</b> <b>note,</b> separation of the security <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> from secured receivable and abuse of the aval guarantee are introduced and examined. The third chapter provides a comprehensive view into incomplete instruments and agreements necessary to transfer them into negotiable instruments. The incomplete instrument abuse is also reviewed and distinguished [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> {{that meets}} certain {{conditions}} is a negotiable instrument regulated by article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

50|$|Historically, <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> {{have acted}} {{as a form of}} privately issued currency. Flying cash or feiqian was a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> used during the Tang dynasty (618 - 907). Flying cash was {{regularly}} used by Chinese tea merchants, and could be exchanged for hard currency at provincial capitals. The Chinese concept of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> was introduced by Marco Polo to Europe. According to tradition, in 1325 a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> was signed in Milan. However, according to a travelogue of a visit to Prague in 960 by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, small pieces of cloth were used as a means of trade, with these cloths having a set exchange rate versus silver. There is evidence of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> being issued in 1384 between Genoa and Barcelona, although the letters themselves are lost. The same happens for the ones issued in Valencia in 1371 by Bernat de Codinachs for Manuel d'Entença, a merchant from Huesca (then part of the Crown of Aragon), amounting a total of 100 florins. In all these cases, the <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> were used as a rudimentary system of paper money, for the amounts issued could not be easily transported in metal coins between the cities involved. Ginaldo Giovanni Battista Strozzi issued an early form of <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> in Medina del Campo (Spain), against the city of Besançon in 1553. However, there exists notice of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> being in used in Mediterranean commerce well before that date.|$|R

It is for that reason, that the bill of exchange and <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> essentials need increased attention due to their fundamental importance.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the common notions of negotiable instruments {{as they relate}} to the modern day <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> in the context of residential mortgage lending. The Article further addresses the destruction of the negotiability of such <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> through various undertakings added {{for the benefit of the}} banking industry, often to the detriment of a borrower. The use of negotiable instruments commenced in the 1800 s in England as a way of ensuring a fluid market between trades as there was no fiat currency system in place. The fundamental purpose behind the concept of negotiability was subsequently abrogated by the modernization of the financial industry, and the creation of a global marketplace for the purchase and sale of <b>promissory</b> <b>notes.</b> Furthermore, the Article discusses how the holder in due course doctrine, which limits a borrower’s defenses when a <b>promissory</b> <b>note</b> has been transferred from one note holder to another, has created significant abuse to consumers by the financial industry. The abuse of consumers through the holder in due course doctrine remains a problem unchecked by many courts that continue to apply negotiability law to modern day <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> in real estate mortgage transactions despite the fact that modern day <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> lack any of the tenets of “negotiability” under article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The Article then calls on the judiciary, as theoretically the least political and most impartial branch of government, to find that such <b>promissory</b> <b>notes</b> are no longer negotiable instruments, and therefore must be transferred via assignment pursuant to article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Such a new construct or approach would provide the transparency necessary to protect consumers and preserve defenses to predatory lending by the financial industry...|$|R
