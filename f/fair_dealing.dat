5|$|The pricing of Burger King's value menu {{had been}} the focus of multiple, highly {{contentious}} disputes between the parent company and its franchises for several years during the TPG ownership period. The dispute {{was at the center of}} two separate but related court cases filed against Burger King by an individual Burger King franchise in New York City and the NFA. At the heart of the disputes is the legal concept of the implied covenant of good faith and <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> in regards to long-term franchise agreements.|$|E

25|$|Young v. Facebook, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 2d 1110, is a pro se {{internet}} law case {{in which}} the plaintiff sued the social network Facebook following the termination of her user account. In her original complaint, the plaintiff, Karen Beth Young, alleged violation of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and <b>fair</b> <b>dealing,</b> negligence, and fraud. In the U.S. District Court of Northern California, Facebook moved to dismiss the claim, and on October 25, 2010, presiding Judge Jeremy Fogel granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Redirecting her complaint, Young alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws on disability, as well as breach of contract and negligence. Again, Facebook moved to dismiss, and Judge Fogel dismissed the case without leave to amend.|$|E

25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute <b>fair</b> <b>dealing.</b> The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E
25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not interoperable, though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One {{of the problems is}} that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E
500|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is an {{exception}} to United Kingdom copyright law which allows {{for the use of}} copyrighted works without licensing in certain circumstances. It is governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, which provide three types of situation in which <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is a valid defence: where the use is for the purposes of research or private study, where it is to allow for criticism or review, and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events. This can be contrasted with the United States doctrine of fair use, which provides a general defence rather than rigid and specific categories of acceptable behaviour. Under United Kingdom law, an infringer relying on <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use, as opposed to the [...] "illustrative open list of purposes" [...] in US law. The <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as [...] "fair use" [...] forms, but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911.|$|E

500|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> in United Kingdom {{law is a}} {{doctrine}} which provides an exception to United Kingdom copyright law, {{in cases where the}} copyright infringement is for the purposes of non-commercial research or study, criticism or review, or for the reporting of current events. More limited than the United States doctrine of fair use, <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> originates in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and requires the infringer to show not only that their copying falls into one of the three <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> categories, but also that it is [...] "fair" [...] and, in some cases, that it contains sufficient acknowledgement for the original author. Factors when deciding the [...] "fairness" [...] of the copying can include the quantity of the work taken, whether It was previously published, the motives of the infringer and what the consequences of the infringement on the original author's returns for the copyrighted work will be.|$|E
500|$|The same 2014 {{amendment}} also {{broadened the}} scope of the <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> defence for the [...] "quotation" [...] of suitably acknowledged published works for the purposes of [...] "criticism or review", to [...] "criticism, review or otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{quantity}} {{of the work}} taken is also taken into account. If the infringer uses the majority of a copyrighted work, or all of it, they reduce the expected returns of the copyright owner and compromise [...] "the role that copyright plays in encouraging creativity". As such, the <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> defence usually only applies when part of a work has been taken, although some judicial comments, {{such as those of}} Megaw LJ in Hubbard, state that there are a few cases in which the work is so short that reproducing it in its entirety may be acceptable. The use made of the work is another factor; if the infringer takes a copyrighted work and reorganises or reinterprets it, the courts are more likely to find that the dealing qualifies as fair than if the work is simply reproduced without modification or analysis. In some situations, the <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> defence must be accompanied by [...] "sufficient acknowledgement", where the author and the original work must be identified either by the title or some other description.|$|E
