30|$|Since {{the central}} {{transfer}} payment has the double goal of “fairness” and “efficiency” (Zhu, 1997), {{not only the}} “efficiency”, but also the “fairness” {{should be taken into}} consideration.

In combined with the results, the policy can be acquired: the categorical grant is conductive to fairness, and tax refund is more conductive to efficiency.

40|$|Abstract Fake {{antivirus}} (AV) {{programs have}} been utilized to defraud millions of computer users into paying {{as much as one}} hundred dollars for a phony software license. As a result, fake AV software has evolved {{into one of the most}} lucrative criminal operations on the Internet. In this paper, we examine the operations of three large-scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $ 130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (chargebacks) that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of chargebacks increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by <b>granting</b> more <b>refunds.</b> This lowers the rate of chargebacks and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in chargebacks, which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms...|$|R

40|$|Although in many people’s opinion the European Convention on Human Rights {{has nothing}} to do with taxation, the {{evidence}} of its involvment comes out as a matter of fact. Actually, in the last years the European Court on Human Rights have heard an increasing number of tax cases, so that we could say it has become almost a “regular” tax court. The ECtHR has achieved more and more importance in tax matters, especially since its rulings are taken into account by national courts and arguably also influence tax policies of member States of the Council of Europe. Anyway, since from a tax perspective we have not any specific provision in the ECHR, we must look for which of its provisions can be more involved in taxation issues. The ECtHR’s jurisprudence is very helpful in this research. For example, Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention of Human Rights is the most important one, as it defines the right to property as well as the right of States to tax their citizens. Over the last few years, on various occasions the Court has heavily criticized States which refuse to <b>grant</b> VAT <b>refunds.</b> In the Court’s opinion, the right to a VAT refund is a possession protected by a citizen’s right to property. Nevertheless, rulings by the ECtHR have also had an impact on tax policy, including direct taxes. The ECtHR’s decisions are also important with regard to the right to a fair hearing in tax disputes (Article 6 — Right to a fair trial). According to its case law, the right to a fair hearing applies exclusively to criminal charges and to the determination of civil rights and civil charges. At the same time, for its purpose of interpreting the European Convention of Human Rights, the ECtHR has classified many tax disputes as “criminal charges”. Case law by the ECtHR has also upheld citizens’ rights in various other relevant tax issues; the ECtHR has expressed views on important tax related issues such as discriminatory taxation, the right to privacy and freedom of conscience and religion. Last, but not least, the Court has decided that in tax disputes the principle of ne bis in idem, dealt with in Article 4 of Protocol 7 to the European Convention of Human Rights, applies, i. e. a citizen should not be punished twice for the same tax offence...|$|R
40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{present a}} {{proposal}} for improving the energetic efficiency of a thermally non-insulated and highly energy-consuming two apartment house. The proposal {{is based on a}} technical and cost-related analysis of the renovation and thermal insulation of the house envelope. The thermal insulation of the house envelope consists of windows and doors substitution, façade thermal insulation and roof thermal insulation based on Eco Fund requirements and on the economical thickness of thermal insulation layer which represents an upgrade of the PURES- 2 2010 regulations. In addition, I present ways for reducing or eliminating thermal bridges effects with the use of common thermal insulation products and the vacuum thermal insulation. Furthermore, based on pre-calculations and informative calculations I provide a) an overview of the costs related to each of the activities for renovating and thermally insulating the house under study and b) an estimation of the <b>grant</b> to be <b>refunded</b> based on the requirements of the Eco Fund public call. These calculations form the basis for estimating overall expenses of the renovation and thermal insulation investment. In this regard, I also summarize all procedures that have to be undertaken to get the grant. Based on calculations and electric energy prices I also provide an overview of annual heating savings in energy and money consumption and I evaluate investment criteria which serve to assess the economic rational to renovate and thermally insulate the house envelope. To assess the influence of improved energetic efficiency on a two apartment house price I conducted a survey among residents in Slovenia and an analysis of the prices of comparable two apartment houses. Based on the analysis results of both I conclude that the impact of thermal insulation of house envelope on house price is higher than the renovation and thermal insulation investment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Three Essays on Prices vs. Quantities in Environmental Policy In three essays, {{the debate}} on prices vs. {{quantities}} in environmental regulation is addressed and further developed – theoretically and empirically. First, an environmental „Policy à la Carte“, a regulation that simultaneously employs an emissions tax and a system of tradeable permits among which firms can choose their preferred instrument, is theoretically analyzed. Second, the preferences of firms for the instruments is empirically tested under this policy regime. Third, the differential impacts of an emissions tax and permit trading on abatement technology adoption is investigated empirically. While the performances of single and hybrid instruments are well analyzed in the literature, a Policy à la Carte has not been investigated so far. The simultaneous use of two market-based instruments with the instrument choice delegated to the regulated firms makes this policy design special. The Swiss Confederation implemented such a policy to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. Under this design, firms can usually choose between paying a tax on their carbon dioxide emissions and participating {{in a system of}} tradeable permits. In the former case, they receive a wage-based refund of the tax receipts; in the latter case, they receive free emission allowances based on grandfathering. The first essay „Environmental Policy à la Carte: Letting Firms Choose their Regulation“ analyzes the Policy à la Carte regime theoretically. The three key assumptions are firm heterogeneity, uncertainty in marginal abatement costs, and information asymmetry between the regulator and the firms regarding their abatement technologies. The regulator offers firms a policy menu that consists of a tax and tradeable permits among which firms choose their preferred instrument. She anticipates that firms choose the instrument under which they expect lower costs and sets the tax rate and the cap accordingly. Furthermore, she <b>grants</b> a tax <b>refund</b> and/or auctions off parts of the permits. The latter two fine-tuning elements ensure that firms choose the instruments that are optimal from a social point of view. A single-instrument policy (single tax or single permit trading) fails to provide a first-best outcome under uncertainty. The slope of the marginal abatement cost function relative to the slope of the marginal damage function determines the preferability of either instrument. Using both instruments simultaneously (mixed policy) reduces the welfare loss that arises from uncertainty when firms are optimally assigned to either the tax or permit trading. Therefore, the regulator requires information on firms' abatement technology. Firms do not have an incentive to report this information. It is shown that the asymmetric information problem can be overcome by delegating the prices-versus-quantities decision to firms. In this case, those agents choose the instrument who are better informed, thereby signalling abatement cost information to the regulator. Under limited information, a Policy à la Carte is then not only preferable to an optimally designed single-instrument policy, but it performs even as good as a mixed policy in which the regulator assigns the instruments to firms when she knows the firms' abatement technologies. Furthermore, even firms benefit from the option of being able to choose between the instruments. Besides, the policy is comparatively simple to implement. The second and the third essay both provide empirical research on prices vs. quantities in a way that has not been brought forward so far in the literature. Empirical analysis is applied to an economy where both an emissions tax and permit trading are implemented to regulate harmful emissions. So, instrument-related effects can easily be determined. These unique and ideal conditions are currently provided by Swiss climate policy. Therefore, data from Swiss manufacturing firms were collected. Based on these data, the second essay „Prices vs. Quantities: An Empirical Study of Firms' Instrument Choices“ investigates firms' preferences between paying a tax and participating in permit trading within the Swiss Policy à la Carte regime. Based on the theoretical model of the first essay and by taking into account specific characteristics of the Swiss policy, a formal decision criterion for firms' instrument choices is derived. Theory identifies the driving forces for instrument choice as being permit allocation, wages, uncertainty in abatement costs and the flexibility of firms' abatement technologies. Empirical evidence confirms the influence of the former two aspects. By contrast, uncertainty and technological flexibility do not affect firms' instrument preferences. Based on the empirical results, uncertainty is revealed as not being crucial when firms chose the instrument themselves. The empirical model has an outstanding high predictive power. Moreover, only little information is required about firms in order to predict their preferences between a tax and permit trading correctly {{with a high degree of}} probability. In the last essay „Abatement Technology Adoption under Different Policy Regimes: Some Empirical Evidence“ empirical analysis focuses on the differential impacts of an emissions tax and permit trading on the adoption of abatement technologies. The analysis compares investment expenditures under a tax regime with those under a permit trading regime, thereby taking into account that there might be a self-selection bias due to firms' instrument choices. The result of the empirical analysis is unequivocal: Compared to a tax, free permits provide stronger incentives for technology adoption, i. e. in enhancing dynamic efficiency, a result which is the exact opposite of the traditional view in the theoretical literature. ...|$|R
