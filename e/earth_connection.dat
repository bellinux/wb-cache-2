25|$|A {{functional}} <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> serves {{more than}} protecting against electrical shock, {{as such a}} connection may carry current during the normal operation of a device. Such devices include surge suppression, electromagnetic-compatibility filters, some types of antennas, and various measurement instruments. Generally the protective earth system is also used as a functional earth, though this requires care.|$|E
25|$|Some devices {{require a}} {{connection}} to the mass of earth to function correctly, as distinct from any purely protective role. Such a connection is known as a functional earth- for example some long wavelength antenna structures require a functional <b>earth</b> <b>connection,</b> which generally should not be indiscriminately connected to the supply protective earth, as the introduction of transmitted radio frequencies into the electrical distribution network is both illegal and potentially dangerous. Because of this separation, a purely functional ground should not normally be relied upon to perform a protective function.|$|E

25|$|The {{depth of}} the sockets varies between {{countries}} and age. Older sockets are so shallow {{that it is possible}} to touch the pins of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on the pins, while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident. CEE7/1 sockets accept CEE7/4, CEE7/6 and CEE7/7 plugs without providing an <b>earth</b> <b>connection.</b> The earthed CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets were specifically designed not to allow insertion of CEE7/2 unearthed round plugs fitted to older appliances which had to be earthed via other means.|$|E
25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 round pin plugs (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to rewire their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard. It removed the possibility of connecting Class I (requiring an <b>earth</b> <b>connection)</b> appliances, to socket outlets that are either unearthed (ungrounded) or with incompatible earthing contacts – e.g. 2-pin side-earthed Schuko plug will not make earth contact with a 3-hole, 5-amp BS 546 socket. This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|E
25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and earth ground.|$|E

The Tripoliki was virtually abandoned by the decade of 1980, but can still be found in houses constructed before 1980, and not renovated.

2500|$|The plug {{sides are}} shaped to improve grip {{and make it}} easier to remove the plug from a socket-outlet. [...] The plug is polarised, so that the fuse is in the [...] side of the supply.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of partial discharge (PD) measurement data obtained using radio frequency current transducers (RFCT) {{incorporated into the}} external <b>earthing</b> <b>connections</b> (i. e bushing tap points and neutral to <b>earth</b> <b>connections)</b> offers the possibility of on-line condition monitoring of large transformers. A method for locating PD sources in windings has been developed, based on {{analysis of}} differential equations that model the propagation of PD signals from the source to the measurement point. Analysis reveals that if the discharge at the source {{is assumed to be}} impulse-like, then the form of the response at the measurement points can be simulated as a function of source location along the winding. If all parameters of the winding are known then it is possible to model the response, however, in the field this is often not the case. So the method developed here uses information from the PD measurements themselves to estimate the unknown coefficients required to simulate the likely discharge currents. With these estimates it is then possible to compare PD measurement information with simulation data in order to identify the most likely location of a PD source. An experiment based on a section of high voltage winding has been used to produce PD measurement data and to validate the proposed approach...|$|R

2500|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance.

2500|$|Because {{they have}} no earth {{connections}} they have been or are being phased out in most countries. The regulations of countries using the CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 socket standards vary in whether CEE7/1 sockets are still permitted in environments where the need for earthing is less critical. Sweden, for example, prohibited them from new installations in 1994. In Romania, when the electrical installation of a premises is being replaced earthed sockets are installed; yet CEE 7/1 wall sockets are still available in hardware stores, and in rural {{areas of the country}} there are still houses being built and outfitted with sockets lacking the <b>earth</b> <b>connection</b> in rooms other than the bathroom and kitchen, following the formerly standard practice in Romania.
