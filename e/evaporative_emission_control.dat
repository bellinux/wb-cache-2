40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> systems of European passenger cars on the basis of real-world activity data. The study relies on two large datasets of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems, consisting of 4. 5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28, 000 vehicles over one month. Real world <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> are estimated using a model that associates a carbon canister desorption event to each trip and a fuel vapour generation event to each parking. The mass of volatile organic compounds released into the air is calculated taking into account the hot-soak, permeation and breathing emission mechanisms. The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> values above the current type approval limit (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle). In July, these numbers increase to 10 out of the 18 scenarios for Modena and to 12 out of the 18 scenarios for Firenze. Looking at the fleet distribution a share of approximately 20 % of the fleet is characterised by <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> higher than the limit in May, increasing to 48 % in July, with a peak value of 98 %.

40|$|Improving the {{air quality}} in China is a long and arduous task. Although China has made very {{aggressive}} plan on pollutants control, the difficulties to achieve the new air quality goals are still significant. In north, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 are still far beyond the standards. In south, O 3 goal is much challenged. A lot of cities are making their city implementation plan (CIP) for new air quality goals. In this study, a southern city, Guangzhou, is selected to analyze the feasibility and difficulties on new air quality standard compliance, {{as well as the}} CIP evaluation. A comprehensive study of air quality status in Guangzhou and surrounding area is conducted based on 22 sites monitoring data of O 3, PM 2. 5 and PM 10. The monthly non-attainment rates for O 3 vary in 7 – 25 % from May to November. The city average PM 2. 5 concentration is 41 μg m – 3 in Guangzhou in 2010, which needs to be reduced by at least 15 % to achieve the target of 35 μg m – 3. The PM 2. 5 high violate months are from November to March. Guangzhou CIP was then evaluated with PM 2. 5 and O 3 placed in a core position. The emission amount of NO x, PM 10, PM 2. 5 and VOC in 2025 would be controlled to 600, 420, 200 and 860 thousand tons respectively. Analysis of air quality using the MM 5 -STEM model suggests that the long-term control measures would achieve the PM 2. 5 and PM 10 goals successfully by 2025. The PM 2. 5 annual average concentration would be reduced to 20. 8 μg m – 3 in 2025. The O 3 non-attainment rate would increase from 7. 1 % in 2010 to 12. 9 % in 2025 and become the most primary atmospheric environmental problem. Guangzhou needs very strong control on VOCs to reduce its ozone.

40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single carbon canister. The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> test procedure was simulated, enabling the calculation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions,</b> namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> depends largely on the canister condition. A well purged canister, e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. <b>Evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions.</b> The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|R

40|$|A test {{programme}} designed {{to investigate the}} influence of gasoline vapour pressure and ethanol content on <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from modern passenger cars {{has been carried out}} by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission jointly with CONCAWE and EUCAR. Seven gasoline passenger cars representative of current EURO 3 / 4 emissions technology were tested for <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> with ten different test fuels. The test fuel matrix comprised 60 and 70 kPa hydrocarbon base fuels with 5 and 10 % ethanol splash blends and 5 and 10 % ethanol matched volatility blends. The <b>evaporative</b> <b>emission</b> tests were carried out according to a test protocol based on the European homologation test procedure, with no additional vehicle conditioning. Although this test protocol turned out to have a considerable influence on the results, the programme has provided valuable information and several clear conclusions can be drawn. The programme confirmed that vapour pressure (DVPE) is a key fuel variable for <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions.</b> However the effect of vapour pressure is strongly non-linear; the ethanol blends with final DVPE around 75 kPa gave considerably higher <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> than the lower volatility fuels in most of the vehicles. Differences between fuels with DVPE in the range 60 - 70 kPa were small. Additional tests on two vehicles performed after the main programme have raised some questions about possible effects of ethanol on carbon canister working capacity and on the role of permeation in determining <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions.</b> Further research would be required to clarify these effects.
