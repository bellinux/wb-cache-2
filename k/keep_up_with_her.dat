500|$|Krusty the Clown, born Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofski, {{was born}} in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Hyman Krustofski. Very little is known about his mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen. Hyman {{strongly}} opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract him from his religion, wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father's back. One day, he was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofski found out, he disowned his son, and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty was later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson. It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by [...] "acting up". Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi. (a reference to Elvis Presley's birthplace) Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that she started hating clowns, and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> birthdays and to also make occasional in-show references to 'my daughter'.|$|E

Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody said the album established Queen as [...] "the voice for women", complimenting her [...] "self-assured delivery".

Rachel Devitt, also writing for Rhapsody, categorized the album as [...] "Urban Latin" [...] music. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly called the album their number one pick for crossover success in the United States while complimenting the [...] "catchy hooks and sticky grooves" [...] found on the album. Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times said [...] " [...] celebrates her hybrid genre by refusing to stay put", while claiming Queen to sometimes depart from [...] "reggaeton's sharp, steady shuffle to explore other rhythms". She later said that the album would make Queen a [...] "likely candidate for crossover success, if only she didn't sing in Spanish". An editor for the Chicago Tribune selected the album as one of three to [...] "add to your reggaetón collection" [...] other than Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino (2004). The writer noted the included hits ("Quiero Bailar" [...] and [...] "Papi Te Quiero"), along with [...] " [...] handful of remixes–and a whole lot of attitude". The album was highly anticipated and acclaimed and widely regarded as a factor in reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with her next studio album Real (2004), Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri (2004), after being certified Platinum in the Latin field signifying sales of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jonathan Widran of Allmusic described [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] as a song that [...] "gets the party and people moving" [...] and as well as being one of Queen's hits. Kid Curry, of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW (Power 96) cites Ivy Queen's release of [...] "Yo Quiero Bailar" [...] as [...] "the last reggaetón super-hit". [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] was selected as one of the hits from [...] "The Golden Era of Reggaetón" [...] which lasted from 2003 until 2007 by Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine. The album was nominated for [...] "Reggaeton Album of the Year" [...] at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards where she was also nominated for [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female" [...] and [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, New Artist".|$|E

Meanwhile, Alex has been watching her routine, waiting for another chance to strike, and he realises that he can loosen the starboard searchlight and drop it on her head when he hears her emerge from the cabins. However, the day he chooses to act, Sarah inadvertently lets the door slam behind her on one lap, waking Hogben from his drunken stupor. On her next lap, Hogben follows her out of the cabin to shout at her for disturbing him, and when he lets the door slam shut behind him, Alex inadvertently drops the searchlight on him instead of on Sarah.|$|R
