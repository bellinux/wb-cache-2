50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and <b>graphite</b> <b>grease</b> used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: One of {{the reasons}} behind the {{interest}} in copper titanium alloys was development of new materials to substitute copper beryllium alloys. The reason for selecting that material for studies {{was that in the}} early stages of decomposition of CuTi 4 alloy a spinodal transformation takes place and ordering processes begin. Proper selection of heat treatment and plastic working conditions provides possibilities to produce very wide range of sets of properties by formation of the required alloy microstructure. Therefore the main objective of the study was to capture the changes in precipitation kinetics, especially in the relations between supersaturation and ageing or between supersaturaion, cold deformation and ageing in connection to the changes in microstructure and functional properties (mainly changes in hardness and electrical conductivity). Design/methodology/approach: Melting of the charge material was conducted in medium-frequency induction furnace, in a graphite crucible. The melted material after bath preparation was poured into a cast iron ingot mould (with <b>graphite</b> <b>grease</b> applied on the inside) of dimensions 35 x 120 x 250 mm. The ingots after casting were peeled. The treated ingots were heated in resistance furnace at 900 ºC for 1. 5 hour and rolled down on a reversible two-high mill. Findings: Decomposition of supersaturated solid solution in that alloy is similar to the alloys produced in laboratory scale. The observed differences in microstructure after supersaturation were related to the presence of undissolved Ti particles and increased segregation of titanium distribution in copper matrix including microareas of individual grains. The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the alloy. Research limitations/implications: Cold deformation (50 % reduction) of the alloy after supersaturation changes the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and provides possibilities for production of broader sets of functional properties. It is expected that widening of the cold deformation range should result in more complete characteristics of material properties, suitable for the foreseen applications. Similar effects can be expected after application of cold deformation after ageing. Practical implications: The elaborated research results present some utilitarian qualities since they can be used in development of process conditions for industrial scale production of strips from CuTi 4 alloy of defined properties and operating qualities. Originality/value: The mentioned factors influence the mechanism and kinetics of precipitation and subsequently the produced wide ranges of functional properties of the Cu-Ti alloys...|$|E
50|$|Ballpoint pens {{have been}} used by Soviet and then Russian space {{programs}} as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with <b>graphite</b> pencils and <b>grease</b> pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to outgassing and temperature variations.|$|R
5|$|Herdwick lambs {{are born}} black, {{and after a}} year they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned, and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks {{traditionally}} have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated, and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or <b>graphite</b> mixed with <b>grease.</b> For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks—now replaced by ear tags.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} thermal contact {{resistance}} is measured for {{different kinds of}} composite materials. The gaps at contact surface between two highly conducting materials are filled with the interstitial material. The interfacial gap is maintained by applying pressure on the surface by using shim, until certain thickness has been obtained. Shims of multiple sizes are used obtain different sizes of the gaps. Samples of the interface materials like Silicone grease, Eupec <b>grease,</b> Unial <b>grease,</b> <b>graphite</b> foil, silicone foil, aluminum foils, etc were tested. Also these samples with different material compositions were experimented. The measured thermal resistance values are compared with the theoretical values of thermal resistance for all the materials tested. In other words, the thermal conductivities published by their respective manufacturers are validated. It is found that thermal resistance is least for foils compared to grease or grease filled with powder. Also of all the foils tested, aluminum yielded the best results {{as far as the}} thermal resistance is concerned...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. Part A {{describes}} the development o f some biosensors based on the immobilisation o f enzymes, tissue, microbes and plant materials in carbon paste. The performance characteristics o f these biocatalytic devices were investigated in both batch and flowing systems for the detection o f neurotransmitters, mono-phenols and glucose using amperometry. A new immobilisation procedure involving the use o f spectroscopic <b>graphite</b> and silicone <b>grease</b> is also described. Anodic Stripping Voltammetry was employed to illustrate the detection o f Pb(II) and Cu(II) at lichen-modified carbon paste electrodes. Continuing the theme o f metal analysis in Part B, comparison o f chromatographic and spectrometric methods is described for the detection o f Fe(III) and Al(III) in soils and clays. Information regarding speciation o f these metals within the matrices o f soils and clays was obtained. Subsequently, a chromatographic method for the separation o f Fe(II) and Fe(III) was investigated involving the use o f an ion-pairing reagent...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} work presented in this volume {{is to develop a}} process for the separation and purification of actinium- 227 produced by neutron bombardment of radium- 226 and to develop methods by which uniform films of actinium metal may be deposited on metallic surfaces. The design work on the cave structure and mechanical equipment used in the actinium separation is proceeding on schedule. As the mechanical design phase is nearing completion the emphasis is being directed toward processing equipment. The process as well as the mechanical equipment has been adapted from the research work of F. T. Hagemann and the Remote Control Group at Argonne National Laboratory. Consequently, one of the first objectives is to become familiary with the chemistry of the process and the operation of the mechanical equipment. Cold runs have been made on the T. T. A. benzene extraction using lanthanum and barium in place of actinium and radium. No difficulty with the operation was observed. The formation of precipitates was one of the difficulties encountered with the process as the precipitates carry radium. It has been found that metals such as nickel cause these precipitates to form and should, therefore, be avoided in the construction of equipment. it was also found that a T. T. A. solution exposed to 0. 5 curie of polonium over a period of days develops a precipitate. Some new mechanical features hav eshown promise. The use of copper-coated glassware which will hold together even though the glass is cracked has made it possible to replace custom-built heaters with standard heating mantles. A new <b>graphite,</b> silicone <b>grease</b> mixture appears to hold up in stopcocks handling benzene and, as a result, may eliminate the necessary of entering the cave for regreasing. Tests on the preparation of dense concrete have given results which meet the shielding requirements for the cave. A strippable paint and tape combination has been studied and specified to provide for decontamination of the interior of the cave. A number of different methods for the preparation of actinium metal are being tested with lanthanum compounds. It has not been found possible to reduce lanthanum from liquid ammonia with metallic sodium. Electrolytic methods are being investigated. Preliminary work has been started in an effort to determine polarographically the reduction potential of lanthanum from various fused salts. An attempt to obtain lanthanum metal from the iodide by the DeBoer proces is also under way. Lanthanum iodide vapor is thermally decomposed at a tungsten filament and the iodine vapor pumped from the system...|$|R
