40|$|Basic data on thermophysical {{properties}} of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) copolymers poly(3 HB-co- 3 HV) were investigated {{with the aim}} of understanding the role of 3 -hydroxyvalerate monomeric units (3 HV) incorporated during random copolymerization. The results show strong evidence that <b>internal</b> <b>plastification</b> is produced by the introduction of 3 HV units in the copolymer. It was observed that copolymer thermal conductivity increased approximately linearly with the 3 HV content. On the other hand, thermal diffusivity was very sensitive to the change in the copolymer composition showing a sudden rise that attained a saturation plateau. Amplitude-frequency plots indicate that a thermoelastic bending mechanism is operating. In this paper a new photoacoustic arrangement for the measurement of thermal effusivity is presented...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{some recent}} results concerning processable electroconducting materials prepared starting with properly substituted pyrrole derivatives. The first approach {{was based on}} the preparation of a precursor polymer by free radical polymerization of N-vinylpyrrole. This insulating, soluble and filmable polymer could be converted into an electroconducting product by intramolecular ladderization through oxidation of the pyrrole side chains. In the same frame the chemical homo and copolymerization of 3 -decylpyrrole with pyrrole allowed to produce soluble or swellable polymers having conductivity variable with copolymer composition. The ladder formation and <b>internal</b> <b>plastification</b> by the long aliphatic side chain have been combined to give polymers derived from 3 -decyl-N-vinylpyrrole and its copolymers with N-vinylpyrrole. Relationships between electroconductivity and controlled structure of the subject materials are discussed with reference to their blends with insulating plastomers...|$|E
