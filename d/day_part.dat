5|$|In 1873 {{the idea}} was resurrected– again by Palmer, who was now Lord Selborne and the new Lord Chancellor– as the Supreme Court of Judicature bill. While still cautious, Selborne's bill was far more {{structured}} than Hatherley's, and contained more detail on {{what was to be}} done. Rather than fusing the common law and equity, which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy the idea of trusts, he decided to fuse the courts and the procedure. The final draft provided that all of the existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels; one of first instance, one appellate. The court of first instance, {{to be known as the}} High Court of Justice, would be subdivided into several divisions based on the old superior courts, one of which, the Chancery Division, would deal with equity cases. All jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery was to be transferred to the Chancery Division; Section 25 of the Act provided that, where there was conflict between the common law and equity, the latter would prevail. An appeal from each division went to the appellate level, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. These provisions were brought into effect after amendment with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, and the Court of Chancery ceased to exist. The Master of the Rolls was transferred to the new Court of Appeal, the Lord Chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles, and the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist, replaced by ordinary judges. The Chancery Division remains to this <b>day</b> <b>part</b> of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

40|$|The {{timetabling}} {{problem is}} known as a large class of problems that fall under the mathematical field of scheduling. A widely used method to solve timetabling problems is the integer linear programming method, which we have used to solve the open day timetabling problem. In this thesis we have addressed a timetabling problem for the open day at the Christian College Groevenbeek. This open day consists of two separate day parts: the morning and the afternoon. For both <b>day</b> <b>parts</b> we have received a data set. These data sets consist of students and their preferred studies. To solve the problem we created several mathematical models formulated as an ILP. After that, we implemented these models in AIMMS to solve them for the data sets we have received. The first model we created was the feasibility model. We used this model to determine the appropriate number of lecture halls and lecture hall capacities when we have 4 rounds on both <b>day</b> <b>parts.</b> To achieve 4 rounds on both <b>day</b> <b>parts</b> we found that the best combination to have is 19 lecture halls with a capacity of 30 and 1 lecture hall with a capacity of 40. In addition, for a good quality schedule objective functions were considered. The first objective was to minimize the number of presentations. The second objective was to minimize the total workload. The workload of a teacher is the total time a teacher is present at the college, which consists of the number of presentations he has to give and the number of gaps he has in his schedule. A gap is a round where a teacher is not scheduled to give a presentation, but has to be present. We added each objective and their corresponding constraints to the feasibility model. After applying both models to the data sets we concluded that the second objective resulted in a better schedule, as it achieves the theoretical minimum number of presentations and creates zero gaps in the schedules for both <b>day</b> <b>parts.</b> When we combined the schedules for both <b>day</b> <b>parts</b> this did not result in a good schedule as some studies still contained gaps between the two <b>day</b> <b>parts.</b> To improve this we minimized the total workload for both data sets combined.

25|$|On 21 May, Evans {{was ordered}} to capture {{crossings}} over the Somme from Picquigny to Pont-Remy and then be ready to operate to the east or north depending on the circumstances. At Rouen, Beauman had received intelligence that the Germans had already captured the Somme crossings and were moving on the Seine bridges near Rouen. Beauman ordered the crossings to be secured by part of the divisional Support Group and next <b>day</b> <b>part</b> of the division concentrated in the Forêt de Lyons, east of Rouen as a flank guard on the lower Andelle {{and to protect the}} arrival {{of the rest of the}} division on 23 May. Early that <b>day,</b> <b>part</b> of the 1st Armoured Division advanced to the Bresle on a line from Aumale to Blangy, as reports were received that the German forces on the southern flank were on the defensive, only reconnoitring south of the river as they attacked St. Omer and Arras in the north. The French Seventh Army had closed up to German positions from Péronne to Amiens, ready to cross the river on 23 May. GHQ ordered a 1st Armoured Division attack, to combine with the Anglo-French operations at the Battle of Arras which had begun on 21 May.|$|E
25|$|Several {{other actions}} {{occurred}} during the same week. On the 23rd, Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières defeated a probe by Prussian troops at Bieżuń. On 24 December, an action occurred at Kołoząb and Sochocin where Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps attempted to cross the Wkra. The French managed to secure a foothold on the east bank, forcing Major General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly's Russian defenders to retreat. On Christmas <b>Day,</b> <b>part</b> of Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps drove the Prussians from Soldau (Działdowo), forcing them to retreat north toward Königsberg. The Russians, however, were full of fight and two sharp battles occurred on 26 December.|$|E
25|$|After {{a weekend}} break, filming resumed on the Desilu Gower Street sets, where My Three Sons was {{normally}} shot. These {{were used to}} represent {{the interior of the}} mission where Keeler nurses McCoy back to health. DeForest Kelley felt that McCoy should also fall for Keeler; so Pevney shot the scenes with that element included but never included it in the final cut. The following two days were spent on the same sets, while on day 5 the action moved to the bridge set for the Enterprise. This day's shoot was meant to include scenes in the transporter room and in the Enterprise corridors, but by now the production was a full day behind and these were pushed to the following <b>day.</b> <b>Part</b> way through day 6, the filming moved to a neighboring set for the exterior ruin shots and the Guardian of Forever, which was used for the next two and a half days. The montage of historical footage was all taken from the Paramount film library, as was the footage of the Brooklyn Bridge.|$|E

500|$|State {{and federal}} {{agencies}} {{are in the process}} of replacing the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River. The original Tappan Zee bridge, carrying the concurrency of New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, is a cantilever bridge built during 1952–55. The bridge is [...] long and spans the Hudson at its second-widest point. The deteriorating current structure bears an average of 138,000vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity. During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000vehicles per <b>day.</b> <b>Part</b> of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed to last only 50years. The Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee's replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge.|$|E

I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character.
