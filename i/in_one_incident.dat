5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices.

5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years {{introduced him to the}} wrong side of the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> he and his brother Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages.

It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu.

The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E

The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only Marshal to die in the war. His death was grieved by a large crowd, and his funeral service took place in St. Lukes Church, Buffalo. The 6th Cavalry who was sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable to keep the peace. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident,</b> a group of men set fire to the Post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry's barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks; shattering his left arm and disabling him from serving in the Cavalry anymore.|$|E

They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns {{in the region and}} in the evacuation of casualties. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> on 24 March 1993, during an attempt to establish an air evacuation route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{relationship}} with the skinheads varied at times. Barson was particularly displeased with the band's skinhead association, often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances. Before becoming a full member of the band, Chas Smash {{had been involved in}} fights with skinheads at performances. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> on 18 November 1979, Madness were supported by Red Beans and Rice, who featured a black lead singer, and the band was prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead-filled audience. Suggs later came on stage to show his displeasure at their behaviour, but this did not stop much of the audience from Nazi saluting {{at the end of the}} show.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>one</b> amusing <b>incident,</b> Carter {{beat out}} her {{contemporary}} Margaret O'Brien for a part {{because her mother}} had dressed her in white gloves.

5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked and ate it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>incident</b> resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
