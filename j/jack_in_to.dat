He cast a quick, {{stealthy}} look at Kitty, and then as suddenly withdrew his glance. What {{had happened to her}} who was usually dressed so prettily? Alas! true to her resolution, Kitty had again refused Fanny's dresses that morning, and had faithfully put on her own travelling-suit,--the suit which Rachel had made her, and which had seemed so very well at Eriecreek that they had called Uncle <b>Jack</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> admire it when it was tried on. Now she knew that it looked countrified, and its unstylishness struck in upon her, and made her feel countrified in soul. [...] "Yes," [...] she owned, as she met Mr. Arbuton's glance, [...] "I'm nothing but an awkward milkmaid beside that young lady." [...] This was unjust to herself; but truly it was never in her present figure that he had intended to show her to his world, which he had been sincere enough in contemning for her sake while away from it. Confronted with good society in these ladies, its delegates, he doubtless felt, as never before, the vastness of his self-sacrifice, the difficulty of his enterprise, and {{it would not have been}} so strange if just then she should have appeared to him through the hard cold vision of the best people instead of that which love had illumined. She saw whatever purpose toward herself was in his eyes, flicker and die out as they fell from hers. Then she sat alone while they three walked up and down, up and down, and the skirts of the ladies brushed her garments in passing.|$|E
5000|$|The cities, {{particularly}} the city state of Anvard, {{are dominated by}} wealthy and exclusive clans which self-select their members for physical and psychological homogeneity and head up a hierarchy of half-clan culls, clanless half-citizens, slaves, visiting nomads (some non-human), and genetic [...] "constructs" [...] with animal features. Large corporations and a decentralized infotrader/media network both wield considerable and at times quite nefarious influence.

50|$|The action mostly {{takes place}} in two modes: a 3D {{cyberpunk}} environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which {{pose a threat to}} the player's ability to <b>jack</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the system, and which must be defeated.|$|E

5000|$|In {{collaborating with}} Matthew Wilhelm Kapell, Lawrence has {{explored}} {{the idea of}} the [...] "mythic franchise," [...] the core mythic story that is licensed for a myriad of commercial entertainment venues. In Matthew Kapell and William G. Doty's <b>Jacking</b> <b>In</b> <b>to</b> the Matrix Franchise: Cultural Reception and Interpretation (2005), he explores the kind of fascism that is symbolically conveyed by heroic figures such as Luke Skywalker of Star Wars (1977) and Neo in The Matrix series. Matthew Kapell and Lawrence's co-edited book, Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and Critics (2006), examines the myths, the stereotypes, sexualities, the toys, and the critical response to the two Star Wars trilogies. Lawrence's essay contribution suggests that George Lucas outgrew Joseph Campbell's aversion to political affirmations, especially in the final three films of the series.|$|R

40|$|The {{street where}} people lurk at auctions is a wonderfully compact image, {{one of the}} {{concepts}} that we live by, perhaps without even knowing it. This particular experience of our relationship to the street is an especially visceral and urgent instance of our deeply personal desire for home. The street is both a reality and a rhetorical figure of speech; at once the immediate here and now {{of being on the}} move along a particular street, as well as an instance of the expansive urban environment we call home. William Gibson also used the figure of the street as both reality and metaphor in his Neuromancer trilogy of novels. While these works have become known for their futuristic portrayal of life in the age of cyberspace, of the mind <b>jacked</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the data stream of networks, they are in their own way nostalgic for a particular idea of home and a way of living...|$|R
