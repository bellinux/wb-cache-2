5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|There Geoffrey of Villehardouin {{had entered}} {{the service of a}} local Greek magnate against his rivals, and had gained the {{impression}} that the country was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> When the magnate died, his son broke off the alliance with him, but Villehardouin, learning that the Crusaders under Boniface were besieging the Greek magnate Leo Sgouros in Nauplia and the Acrocorinth in the northwest, set out to seek his aid. Boniface sought to retain him in his own service, but Villehardouin teamed up with his fellow Champenois, Champlitte, whom he enticed with tales of the richness of the land and with a pledge to recognize him as his lord. Boniface finally sanctioned their undertaking, and in charge of around a hundred knights and several soldiers, Champlitte and Villehardouin set out together to conquer the Morea. The towns of Patras and Andravida fell without struggle, and at the latter Champlitte received the homage of the local magnates and people of the Skorta and Mesarea. From there the Franks moved south along the coast, accompanied by a fleet, easily taking the fortress of Pontikon, which they repaired and garrisoned. They bypassed the strong fortress of Arkadia (Kyparissia), and passing through Navarino, arrived at Modon. They repaired the fortress walls, long ago torn down by the Venetians to stop its use as a pirate base, and assaulted the nearby fort of Coron, which fell after a single day, and the town of Kalamata, which surrendered.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E
25|$|In Vilnius, LAF {{had been}} {{dismantled}} by Soviet arrests {{just before the}} war and Lithuanians formed only {{a small minority of}} the city's population. Therefore, the uprising was smaller in scale and started on June 23. The rebels took over the post office, radio station, and other institutions, and hoisted the Lithuanian flag over the Gediminas' Tower. It was relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of Vilnius as most units of the Red Army were located outside the city and retreated rather quickly. The first German units entered the city on June 24. The 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Hans Freiherr von Funck, expected that the Red Army would resist in Vilnius and made plans to bombard the city.|$|E

The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to Sablé-sur-Sarthe, on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army and attached British troops to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council met at Briare and General Charles de Gaulle (Minister of War) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, De Gaulle reported that Quimper would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since it would be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> ship to England or Africa, since the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.|$|E

500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed a sitter Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment he takes off one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from another door behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe and touch the arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer stepped forward and revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E

An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse".

[...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all it did was get me picked on.

2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
