Advisor: Dr. Nicolas Jordan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 104 pages, appendices A (pages 91 - 104) Water potential gradients {{have been largely}} ignored as a primary factor capable of influencing <b>interplant</b> <b>transfer</b> {{even though there was}} evidence of hydraulic conductivity across the biotrophic plant fungi interface. Using two fluorescence tracer molecules, phorwite and rhodamine, a direct transfer pathway was observed and direct transfer quantified between two Illinois Bundleflower (Desmanthus illinoensis) plant root systems linked by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) hyphae. Three water potential gradients were tested: (i) receiver plant water-stressed - 0. 25 ±. 03 MPa, (ii) no water stress, and (iii) donor plant water-stressed. When the receiver plant was water-stressed, rapid (< 18 h) dye transfer occurred, obeying the source/sink paradigm often utilized in other interplant nutrient transfer studies...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{that shows}} the {{existence}} of <b>interplant</b> carbon <b>transfer</b> via common ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal networks is reviewed on basis of literature study. Although physiological and ecological investigations have provided evidence for some prerequisites {{for this kind of}} transfer, there is no direct evidence available. This may be caused by the used research methods that possibly underestimated the species specificity of the interaction between the mycorrhizal partners, or did not respect the importance of the plants' growth rates and the period of labeling with isotopes. This may be why the amounts of carbon found to be transported into the shoots of receiving plants have been very small in experiments where the transfer between arbuscular mycorrhizal networks was investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{behaviour}} of plants, including {{rapid changes}} in physiology, gene regulation and defence response, {{can be altered}} when linked to neighbouring plants by a mycorrhizal network (MN). Mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes include mycorrhizal fungal colonization by the MN or <b>interplant</b> communication via <b>transfer</b> of nutrients, defence signals or allelochemicals. We focus this review on our new findings in ectomycorrhizal ecosystems, and also review recent advances in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. We {{have found that the}} behavioural changes in ectomycorrhizal plants depend on environmental cues, the identity of the plant neighbour and the characteristics of the MN. The hierarchical integration of this phenomenon with other biological networks at broader scales in forest ecosystems, and the consequences we have observed when it is interrupted, indicate that underground ‘tree talk’ is a foundational process in the complex adaptive nature of forest ecosystems...|$|R
