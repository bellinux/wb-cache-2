5|$|In The Kingdom of This World, Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked <b>from</b> <b>developing,</b> in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters <b>from</b> <b>developing.</b>|$|E

Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his new wife's train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned {{with a group of}} politicians.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{heterogeneous}} effects of immigration on economic growth depending on both the origin and the destination countries. Following {{the development of a}} simple growth model augmented by the embodied human capital of immigrants, we estimate the growth equation using a gravity-style instrument variable approach and the dynamic system-GMM estimator. We find that immigration <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> economies positively affects the economic growth of the host countries. Furthermore, the growth-enhancing effect of immigration is significantly larger when immigration flows <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> to developing economies than when it does to those that include both developed and developing economies. We interpret these results as evidence of immigrants <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> countries bringing with them – upon entry – their advanced knowledge on technology and institutions into the developing countries that host them. ...|$|R

In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E
5|$|An upper-low {{pressure}} system {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on September6, with the circulation heading westward. Initially, minimal development occurred, though by September8, the system became a surface low. It is estimated that the surface low became a subtropical depression by 0000UTC on the following day. Over the next 24hours, the low began acquiring tropical characteristics, mainly <b>from</b> <b>developing</b> deep convection on its north and east sides. By early on September10, observations from oil rigs, radars, and Air Force reconnaissance flights indicated that the subtropical system had transitioned into Tropical Depression Four. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally issue advisories until 1900UTC on September10, at which time Chris was already a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection <b>from</b> <b>developing</b> near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} explore internationalization strategy choices for MNEs <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> and emerging markets through the investigations of their internationalization motivations, {{the process of}} foreign market selection and entry modes choices. By the applications of Dunning’s OLI theory, Institution-based view and the Uppsala model, the internationalization strategy choices that applied by MNEs <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> and emerging market are well examined. Finally, this dissertation makes a detailed comparison between these two kinds of MNEs and concludes their difference and similarities {{in terms of their}} internationalization strategy. In this dissertation, the method of case study is used as the research method to investigate the internationalization strategy choices for MNEs <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> and emerging markets. Huawei and Apple are chosen as the representatives for these two kinds of MNEs. Through the comparison between Huawei and Apple, the different internationalization strategy choices for MNEs <b>from</b> <b>developed</b> and emerging markets are concluded and well analysed. Furthermore, some suggestions are provided for the future development of MNEs and also some limitations of this dissertation are presented...|$|R

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners turned their attention <b>from</b> <b>developing</b> the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading {{to the birth of}} international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E

The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.

Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas.
