500|$|On March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt {{went to the}} Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest {{before his}} {{anticipated}} appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of}} my head." [...] He then slumped <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). At 3:35pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, “so ended an era, and so began another.” After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, [...] "Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House".|$|E
500|$|Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd (1862–1944), {{a widower}} then in his fifties, but despite her {{marriage}} and Franklin's promise, the two remained in surreptitious, albeit infrequent contact {{in the three}} decades that followed. Especially during the War years, Franklin's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, more frequently after Rutherfurd's death in 1944. [...] Mercer was in Warm Springs, Georgia, at the [...] "Little White House" [...] the President's long-time cottage and retreat, {{at the time of}} Roosevelt's death in April 1945. He was having his portrait painted, at Mercer's request, by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending. While sitting at a card table by the fireplace, reading an upcoming speech, Roosevelt said, [...] "I have a terrific pain {{in the back of my}} head." [...] He then slumped <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> unconscious. [...] Madame Shoumatoff, who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. [...] Mercer's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Mr. Newberry, and then, leaning <b>forwards</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and looking}} {{carefully}} about {{the corridors of}} the club, he spoke behind his hand and said, [...] "And the mayor's the biggest grafter of the lot. And what's more," [...] he added, sinking his voice to a whisper, [...] "the {{time has come to}} speak out about it fearlessly." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{servants}} {{had left}} the room, and the doors were fast closed. Lord Arranmore sat a little <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> high-backed <b>chair,</b> one hand grasping the arm, the other stretched flat upon the table before him. By his side, neglected, was a cedar-wood box of his favourite cigarettes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!" [...] And now he swayed himself {{backwards}} and <b>forwards</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> bewailing <b>his</b> own condition and hers, and his past imprudence, while the tears {{ran down his}} cheeks. She still knelt there at his feet, looking up into his face with loving, beseeching eyes, praying him to be comforted, and declaring that all would still be well if he would only forget the subject, or, at any rate, cease to speak of it. But still he went on wailing, complaining of his lot as a child complains, and refusing all consolation. [...] "Yes; I know," [...] said he, [...] "it has all been my fault. But how could I help it? What was I to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Sidney's manner {{suddenly}} changed. He leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Matravers {{laid his}} hand upon hers, and leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|He leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{to attract}} the {{attention}} of a seaman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never heard a sound," [...] {{the younger}} of the {{afternoon}} callers admitted, getting rid of his empty cup and leaning <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> low <b>chair.</b> [...] "No more tea, thank you, Miss Fairclough. Done splendidly, thanks. No, I went to bed last night soon after eleven--the Colonel had been route marching us all off our legs--and I never awoke until reveille this morning. Sleep of the just, and {{all that sort of}} thing, but a jolly sell, all the same! You hear anything of it, sir?" [...] he asked, turning to his companion, who was seated a few feet away.|$|R
6000|$|He stopped, and leant <b>forward</b> {{a little}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> [...] "I didn't {{say it to}} hurt you, Carrie, but because {{the fact that it}} is so, is and must {{necessarily}} be an unutterable relief to me. The indifference of such a man is incomparably better than what he would probably consider his affection. You can see what it has brought Mrs. Custer." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{second was}} Purvis, the publican, {{owner of the}} chief beershop, and well known as the local bookmaker. He was a coarse, clean-shaven man, whose fiery face made a {{singular}} contrast with his ivory-white bald head. He had shrewd, light-blue eyes with foxy lashes, and he also leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> silence from <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> a fat, red hand upon either knee, and stared critically at the young assistant.|$|R
60|$|David leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> His {{eyes were}} bright, his tone eager.|$|E
60|$|The duke turned pale, and leant <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{but did not}} speak.|$|E
60|$|Borrowdean {{took her}} hand and leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> She {{snatched}} it away.|$|E
60|$|Lane {{seemed to}} shake himself {{together}} {{after he had}} read the first few entries; while, watching him closely, I once more saw the tell-tale contraction {{at the corners of}} his mouth. This was the only sign he made, however, save that presently he moved <b>forward</b> a little <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> which was close before the fire, and held up the torn-out page as though he wished the lamplight to fall on it more directly. The action, which was made very naturally, suggested nothing to myself or even to Haldane; but when the reader moved again, Boone rose suddenly and laid a restraining hand on his arm.|$|R
6000|$|It is {{the picture}} of a very old man in a flat cap, sitting sunken <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> deep <b>chair,</b> with <b>his</b> thin, long hands folded one on the other, and looking wearily at you out of <b>his</b> faded eyes, <b>in</b> which dwell the {{memories}} of action in every sort and counsel in every kind. Victor in battles by land and sea, statesman and leader and sage, he looks it all in that wonderful effigy, which shuns no effect of his more than ninety years, but confesses his great age as a part of his greatness with a pathetic reality. The white beard, with [...] "each particular hair" [...] defined, falling almost to the pale, lean hands, {{is an essential part of}} the presentment, which is full of such scrupulous detail as the eye would unconsciously take note of in confronting the man himself and afterward supply in the remembrance of the whole. As if it were a part of his personality, on a table facing him, covered with maps and papers, sits the mighty admiral's cat, which, with true feline im-passiveness, ignores the spectator and gives its sole regard to the admiral. There are possibly better portraits in the world than this, which was once by Sebastiano del Piombo and is now by Titian; but I remember none which has moved me more.|$|R
60|$|They {{were a very}} {{singular}} trio. Each {{was known}} to him by sight; but what on earth the three could be doing together, and, above all, what they could expect from him, was a most inexplicable problem. The first was Sorley Wilson, {{the son of the}} owner of the Nonpareil Coalpit. He was a young blood of twenty, heir to a fortune, a keen sportsman, and down for the Easter Vacation from Magdalene College. He sat now upon the edge of the surgery table, looking in thoughtful silence at Montgomery and twisting the ends of his small, black, waxed moustache. The second was Purvis, the publican, owner of the chief beer-shop, and well known as the local bookmaker. He was a coarse, clean-shaven man, whose fiery face made a singular contrast with his ivory-white bald head. He had shrewd, light-blue eyes with foxy lashes, and he also leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> silence from <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> a fat, red hand upon either knee, and stared critically at the young assistant. So did the third visitor, Fawcett, the horse-breaker, who leaned back, his long, thin legs, with their boxcloth riding-gaiters, thrust out in front of him, tapping his protruding teeth with his riding-whip, with anxious thought in every line of his rugged, bony face. Publican, exquisite, and horse-breaker were all three equally silent, equally earnest, and equally critical. Montgomery seated in the midst of them, looked from one to the other.|$|R
60|$|Peter Ruff leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He, too, had {{expressive}} eyes at times.|$|E
60|$|Quest leaned {{a little}} further <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> his gaze became more concentrated.|$|E
60|$|Wyllard sat silent {{a moment}} or two, and then leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Recovered {{from his}} attack, Merton sat resting languidly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>his</b> half-closed eyes looking {{straight}} before him.|$|R
60|$|George {{was leaning}} back <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>his</b> hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{breeches}} pockets.|$|R
60|$|The {{storekeeper}} straightened himself resolutely <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Selingman leaned {{a little}} <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He was warming to his subject.|$|E
60|$|Ross leaned {{suddenly}} <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> his grey face passion-stirred, {{the sweat}} upon his forehead.|$|E
60|$|With tense nerves he sat leaning <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> but {{suddenly}} he relaxed and dropped back, smiling.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake moved uneasily <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>His</b> {{sense of}} danger was growing.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Carter slewed round <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>His</b> eyes asked a question.|$|R
60|$|The Minister {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>His</b> was the calmness of despair.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave leaned {{a little}} <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> His eyebrows were drawn close together; his gaze was entirely merciless.|$|E
60|$|When {{food was}} set before him, Maxwell ate ravenously; then leaning <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{he looked at}} his hosts.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wadham, Senior, {{looked a}} little startled. His son stopped {{whistling}} under his breath and leaned <b>forward</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sherlock Holmes {{leaned back}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and laughed heartily.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilberfloss, wriggling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> intimated that he was.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} was sitting upright <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>His</b> manner was half minatory.|$|R
