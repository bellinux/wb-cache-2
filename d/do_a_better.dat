5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that {{has proven to be}} a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

30|$|We {{see that}} two reasons {{explain why the}} model with {{constant}} taxes <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job in capturing the average growth in GDP per working-age person over the period 1974 – 2015 than does the benchmark model: First, the model with constant taxes <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job in capturing the capital deepening that starts in the 1980 s. Second, the model with constant taxes accounts for more output growth {{because it does not}} account for the drop in hours worked. The first reason in the model with constant taxes is compatible with the data but leaves unanswered the question of why the capital-output ratio increased as capital income taxes were increasing.|$|R

Our findings differ from the original research as we used a different time-period, and the findings are in line with logical reasoning as during periods of high volatility, historical volatility does not give any prediction of future volatility as circumstances change drastically...|$|R

Yet another sociological theory of law and lawyers is that of Pierre Bourdieu and his followers, who see law as a social field in which actors struggle for cultural, symbolic and economic capital {{and in so doing}} develop the reproductive professional habitus of the lawyer. In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of Adam Podgórecki and his associates (often influenced by Petrazycki's ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by Per Stjernquist, and in Norway by Vilhelm Aubert.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, EGV Entertainment, a {{movie theater}} {{operator}} in Thailand, opened the EGV Drive-in Cafe in Bangkok, explicitly modeling the restaurant after the Sci-Fi Dine-In. Wichai Poolwaraluk, the company's executive {{president and chief executive}} officer, visited the Sci-Fi Dine-In in 2000, and was inspired to open a similar restaurant. He said that, while he was eating at the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the other guests seemed more interested in their food than in the film clips on the screen, and he therefore considered the Sci-Fi Dine-In more of a restaurant than a theater, with the film reel simply being a gimmick. Appealing to EGV's identity as {{a movie theater}} operator, Poolwaraluk said that the EGV Drive-in Cafe [...] "can probably <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job blending the cinema and the food together and also concentrate on both of them". Like the Sci-Fi Dine-In, the EGV Drive-in Cafe features classic cars for seating, but, instead of showing film clips on a loop, the EGV Drive-in Cafe shows entire short films.|$|E

[...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study {{in the context of a}} zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E
