5|$|Based on the Virata Parva of the Indian epic Mahabharata, Nartanasala {{focused on}} the trails of the Pandavas {{in the last year}} of their exile. The Pandavas assumed {{different}} identities and lived incognito in Virata Matsya Kingdom. The Kauravas wished to reveal Pandavas' real identities so that they would repeat another exile of 13 years in a cyclic fashion. The issues <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pandavas and their wife Draupadi at Matsya due to various factors, notably Virata's brother-in-law Kichaka form the rest of the story.|$|E

5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|In August, Ibrahim renewed the {{offensive}} {{and he sent}} a group of regular soldiers down the coast and they reached Kariopoli before they retreated. Ibrahim sent a force of 8,000 men down to Polytsaravo {{and on the way}} they destroyed a tower that was opposing them. When they reached Polytsaravo, they were <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Maniots in their forts. The Egyptians and the Ottomans were forced to retreat with significant losses. This was the last time Mani was invaded during the War for Independence, as Greece was liberated in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{resumed his}} work on {{a history of the}} war that he was writing for the US Army's Historical Division. This effort, working under the {{direction}} of Generaloberst Franz Halder in 1946, brought together a number of German generals for the purpose of producing historical studies of the war, including Gotthard Heinrici, Heinz Guderian, Lothar Rendulic, Hasso von Manteuffel and Georg von Küchler. Kesselring contributed studies of the war in Italy and North Africa and the problems <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German high command. Kesselring also worked secretly on his memoirs. The manuscript was smuggled out by Irmgard Horn-Kesselring, Rainer's mother, who typed it at her home.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ZNG {{included a}} shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, {{a shortage of}} weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the environmental movement {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> MAUD Committee {{was to find}} a way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E

5|$|The chief threats <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E

However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} and the perceived conflict of interest <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> baseball writers who scored games for MLB eventually led many major newspapers to end the practice for their employees. In 1958, The Washington Post prohibited their writers from scoring baseball games. Over {{the next two decades}} other major newspapers joined in the writer-scorer ban, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the major daily newspapers published in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia. In 1980, MLB resolved the conflict by directly hiring official scorers for each stadium.|$|E

5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles <b>faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{threat of}} a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts {{were made by the}} Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension of its current bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E
