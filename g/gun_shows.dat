5|$|After the Columbine High School {{massacre}} on April 20, 1999, <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> {{and background}} checks became {{a focus of}} national debate in the United States. Weeks after the Columbine shooting, Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.|$|E

5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, whether at a gun show or other venue. They also are {{not required}} to record the sale, or ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at <b>gun</b> <b>shows.</b>|$|E
5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at <b>gun</b> <b>shows.</b> Bush's position was that the gun show loophole should be closed by federal legislation since the gun show loophole was created by previous federal legislation. President Bush ordered {{an investigation by the}} U.S. Departments of Health, Education, and Justice {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech shootings in order to make recommendations on ways the federal government can prevent such tragedies. On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments. Filling these information gaps will better enable the system to operate as intended, to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited by federal or state law from receiving or possessing firearms.|$|E

Connolly opposes allowing concealed weapons in schools and on college campuses.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, 2013, Vitter {{voted against}} the Toomey-Manchin Gun Control Amendment. The {{amendment}} failed to reach the sixty senatorial votes necessary to overcome a Republican-led filibuster. The Toomey-Manchin Gun Control Amendment is a bipartisan deal on gun background checks. Under the proposal, federal background checks would be expanded to include <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> and online sales. All such sales would be channeled through licensed firearm dealers who would be charged for keeping record of transactions. The proposal does not require background checks for private sales between individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{resulted in}} {{calls for more}} gun control measures. In 2000 federal and state legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made {{it a crime to}} buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at <b>gun</b> <b>shows.</b> There was concern in the gun lobby over restrictions on Second Amendment rights in the US. In 2001, K-Mart, which had sold ammunition to the shooters, announced it would no longer sell handgun ammunition. This action was encouraged by the award-winning 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine, written and directed by Michael Moore.|$|E

The second bill was proposed by Chuck Grassley would have expanded background checks and made it illegal for individuals with certain mental health disorders to purchase guns. Neither bill passed. Blunt voted against two Democrat-sponsored bills, both which also did not pass, including one {{that would have made}} background checks required for online gun sales and gun sales at <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> and another that would have not allowed anyone on the terrorist watchlist to purchase a gun.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{estimates}} were approximately 44 million gun {{owners in the}} United States. These owners possessed approximately 192 million firearms, of which an estimated 65 million were handguns. A National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms (NSPOF), conducted in 1994, indicated that Americans owned 192 million guns: 36% rifles, 34% handguns, 26% shotguns, and 4% other types of long guns. Most firearm owners owned multiple firearms, with the NSPOF survey indicating 25% of adults owned firearms. In the U.S., 11% of households reported actively being involved in hunting, with the remaining firearm owners having guns for self-protection and other reasons. Throughout the 1970s {{and much of the}} 1980s, the rate of gun ownership in the home ranged from 45-50%. Rapid increases in gun purchases characterized by exceptionally large crowds accruing at gun vendors and <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> is consistently observed due to the possibility of increased gun control following highly publicized mass murders.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) {{released}} <b>Gun</b> <b>Shows</b> in America: Tupperware® Parties for Criminals, a {{study that}} identified problems associated with <b>gun</b> <b>shows.</b> The VPC study documented {{the effect of the}} 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act in regard to proliferation of <b>gun</b> <b>shows,</b> which resulted in [...] "a readily available source of weapons and ammunition {{for a wide variety of}} criminals, as well as Timothy McVeigh and David Koresh". According to the VPC, the utility of <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> to dangerous individuals stems primarily from the exemption enjoyed by private sellers from the sales criteria of the Brady law as well as the absence of a background check. The director of the program which is located at the UC Davis, Garen J. Wintemute, wrote, [...] "There is no such loophole in federal law, in the limited sense that the law does not exempt private-party sales at <b>gun</b> <b>shows</b> from regulation that is required elsewhere." [...] Wintemute said, The fundamental flaw in the gun show loophole proposal is its failure to address the great majority of private-party sales, which occur at other locations and increasingly over the Internet at sites where any non-prohibited person can list firearms for sale and buyers can search for private-party sellers.|$|E
