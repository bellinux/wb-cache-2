25|$|Inflation {{accelerated}} as {{a result}} of a combination of factors: the exchange-rate devaluations of the austerity program, a growing public deficit, and an increasing indexation of financial balances, wages, and other values for inflation. The first two factors are classical causes of inflation; the last became an important mechanism for propagating hyperinflation and in preventing the usual instruments of <b>inflation</b> <b>control</b> from operating.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{investors have}} {{doubts about the}} {{possibilities}} of policy makers to quickly contain the crisis. Since countries that use the euro as their currency have fewer monetary policy choices (e.g., they cannot print money in their own currencies to pay debt holders), certain solutions require multi-national cooperation. Further, the European Central Bank has an <b>inflation</b> <b>control</b> mandate but not an employment mandate, {{as opposed to the}} U.S. Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate.|$|E
25|$|The fixed JG wage {{provides}} an in-built <b>inflation</b> <b>control</b> mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called {{the ratio of}} JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent {{on a range of}} factors including the path of the economy. There is an issue about the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.|$|E

50|$|Since that time, the U.S. {{government}} has not imposed maximum prices on consumer items or labor (although the cap on {{oil and natural gas}} prices persisted for years after 1973).

50|$|Thatcherism is {{associated}} with the economic theory of monetarism. In contrast to previous government policy, monetarism placed a priority on <b>controlling</b> <b>inflation</b> over <b>controlling</b> unemployment. According to monetarist theory, inflation is the result of there being too much money in the economy. It was claimed that the government should seek to control the money supply to <b>control</b> <b>inflation.</b> However, by 1979 it was not only the Thatcherites who were arguing for stricter <b>control</b> of <b>inflation.</b> The Labour Chancellor Denis Healey had already adopted some monetarist policies, such as reducing public spending and selling off the government's shares in BP.|$|R

40|$|The views {{expressed}} are mine {{and do not}} necessarily represent the views of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. I would like to thank Aditya Gummadavelli and Craig Aubuchon for helpful research assistance. The economics profession has made considerable progress in its understanding of the role of central banks in <b>controlling</b> <b>inflation</b> during the 45 years since I took my first course in economics. Until at least the early 1970 ’s the majority of the economics profession believed that central banks could do little to <b>control</b> <b>inflation.</b> Conventional wisdom had it that monetary policy was relatively ineffective for <b>controlling</b> <b>inflation</b> or economic stabilization. Fiscal policy, not monetary policy, was the principle way that governments could stabilize the economy and keep inflation low. Government spending and tax policy could be used to fill the void between private demand and potential output. I review the evolution of economic thought from “there is little central banks can do to <b>control</b> <b>inflation</b> ” to “inflation targeting. ” I argue that policymakers’ belief in the efficacy of monetary policy to <b>control</b> <b>inflation</b> changed dramatically {{in spite of the fact}} that there was no fundamental refutation of what I call the monetary-policy-ineffectiveness proposition. The evolution to inflation occurred because central banks, most importantly the Federal Reserve, demonstrated that monetary policy could <b>control</b> <b>inflation.</b> Unfortunately, ther...|$|R

5000|$|Empirically, {{it is not}} {{so obvious}} that {{inflation}} targeters have better <b>inflation</b> <b>control.</b> Some economists argue that better institutions increase a country’s chances of successfully targeting inflation.

50|$|Governments {{and central}} banks {{primarily}} use monetary policy to <b>control</b> <b>inflation.</b> Central banks {{such as the}} U.S. Federal Reserve increase the interest rate, slow or stop {{the growth of the}} money supply, and reduce the money supply.

50|$|So, for instance, {{rules for}} {{increasing}} or reducing {{the money supply}} based on perceived inflation, or on measuring well-being, reflect some such values, reflect the importance of using (all forms of) financial capital as a stable store of value.

However, it quickly became apparent that he would not be able to fulfill any of these promises. On February 2, 1988, the then-Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Congress questioned the resumption of external debt payments since the default of 1987, without a definitive agreement signed with creditors.
