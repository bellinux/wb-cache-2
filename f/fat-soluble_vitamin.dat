5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. <b>Fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections {{are treated with}} {{antibiotics}} which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes, the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Inhaled hypertonic saline and salbutamol may also be useful. Lung transplantation may be an option if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> supplementation are important, especially in the young. Airway clearance techniques such as chest physiotherapy have some short-term benefit, but long-term effects are unclear. The average life expectancy is between 42 and 50 years in the developed world. Lung problems are responsible for death in 80% of people with cystic fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|Without {{functional}} chylomicrons certain <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> such as vitamin D {{and vitamin}} E cannot be absorbed. Chylomicrons have {{a crucial role}} in fat absorption and transport, thus deficiency in chylomicron functioning reduces available levels of dietary fats and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms which {{underlie the}} function of the water-soluble vitamins have largely been elucidated while those of the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> have for the most part eluded efforts of scientists to date. Perhaps the basic reason for this {{is the fact that the}} B complex group have coenzymic roles in basic reactions of intermediary energy metabolism common to all organisms including the simplest such as bacteria. Thus, with the development of intermediary metabolism and enzymology come the elucidation of their functions. In contrast, the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> are not requir-ed by simple organisms. Instead, these substan-ces are required and utilized by complex multicellular organisms which possess a high degree of division of labor by their cells and tissues. In short, these substances function only in highly differentiated organisms. It is for these highly specialized functions that the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> are required. Since these specialized functions are not yet known at the molecular level nor are the mechanisms whereby the differentiated func-tions develop, the molecular mechanisms of the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> are not known. However, much new information has become available in the last decade and it will be the purpose of this presentation to give a bird’s-eye view of the current status of our understanding of {{the function of}} the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins.</b> The structures of the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> are shown in Fig. 1. There is little resemblance among them except that they are all lipid soluble and they are all derived from isoprene units. It might, therefore, be expected that the nature of their functions might differ substan-tially...|$|R

25|$|Secondary vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with chronic malabsorption of lipids, impaired bile production and release, and chronic exposure to oxidants, such as cigarette smoke, and chronic alcoholism. Vitamin A is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> and depends on micellar solubilization for dispersion into the small intestine, which results in poor use of vitamin A from low-fat diets. Zinc deficiency can also impair absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A because {{it is essential for}} the synthesis of the vitamin A transport proteins and as the cofactor in conversion of retinol to retinal. In malnourished populations, common low intakes of vitamin A and zinc increase the severity of vitamin A deficiency and lead physiological signs and symptoms of deficiency. A study in Burkina Faso showed major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children.|$|E

[...] Extra virgin oil can be obtained during the first pressing of the nuts, possibly for use as a substitute for olive oil due to its mild, pleasant flavor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis {{discovered}} the first vitamin, <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> A, then water-soluble vitamin B (in 1915; now {{known to be}} a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named vitamin C as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919, Sir Edward Mellanby incorrectly identified rickets as a vitamin A deficiency because he could cure it in dogs with cod liver oil. In 1922, McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil, but found that it still cured rickets. [...] Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discover vitamin E as essential for rat pregnancy, originally calling it [...] "food factor X" [...] until 1925.|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, it was {{established}} that when 7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, {{a form of}} a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> is produced (now known as D3). Alfred Fabian Hess stated: [...] "Light equals vitamin D." [...] Adolf Windaus, at the University of Göttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 {{for his work on}} the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins. In 1929, a group at NIMR in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal, and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated the sterol molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by Windaus. In 1932, Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance. The informal academic collaboration between the team members Robert Benedict Bourdillon, Otto Rosenheim, Harold King, and Kenneth Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterization of vitamin D. At this time, the policy of the Medical Research Council was not to patent discoveries, believing the results of medical research should be open to everybody. In the 1930s, Windaus clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D.|$|E

50|$|Vitamins are {{nutrients}} {{required in}} small amounts for essential metabolic reactions in the body. These are broken down in nutrition as either water-soluble (Vitamin C) or <b>fat-soluble</b> (<b>Vitamin</b> E). An adequate supply of vitamins can prevent diseases such as beriberi, anemia, and scurvy while an overdose of vitamins can produce nausea and vomiting or even death.|$|E
50|$|RBP2 is an {{abundant}} protein {{present in the}} small intestinal epithelium. It is thought {{to participate in the}} uptake and/or intracellular metabolism of vitamin A.

50|$|Vitamin K is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> that {{is stable}} in air and {{moisture}} but decomposes in sunlight. It is a polycyclic aromatic ketone, based on 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, with a 3-phytyl substituent. It is found naturally {{in a wide}} variety of green plants, particularly in leaves, since it functions as an electron acceptor during photosynthesis, forming part of the electron transport chain of photosystem I.|$|E

50|$|Vitamins can {{be divided}} into two groups: {{water-soluble}} <b>vitamins</b> and <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins.</b> Water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the B vitamins (folate, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12). Most dialysis patients will need to supplement vitamin C and B vitamins to replace what is lost in the dialysis solution. <b>Fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> include vitamins A, D, E, and K. Excessive amounts of these vitamins can be harmful for people with kidney failure because they can build up in the body and become toxic so they are not generally supplemented in dialysis patients. However, vitamin D is sometimes an exception to this generalization. A doctor will prescribe vitamin D if it is necessary.|$|R
50|$|Abetalipoproteinemia {{affects the}} {{absorption}} of dietary fats, cholesterol, and certain vitamins. People affected by this disorder {{are not able to}} make certain lipoproteins, which are molecules that consist of proteins combined with cholesterol and particular fats called triglycerides. This leads to a multiple vitamin deficiency, affecting the <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. However, many of the observed effects are due to vitamin E deficiency in particular.|$|E
50|$|RBP1 is {{the carrier}} protein {{involved}} in the transport of retinol (vitamin A alcohol) from the liver storage site to peripheral tissue. Vitamin A is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin</b> necessary for growth, reproduction, differentiation of epithelial tissues, and vision. The gene harbors four exons encoding 24, 59, 33, and 16 amino acid residues, respectively. The second intervening sequence alone occupies 19 kb of the 21 kb of the gene.|$|E
50|$|Vitamin D- Normally, {{the kidney}} changes vitamin D into its active form, vitamin D3, which helps you absorb calcium. Many {{dialysis}} patients have low intakes of calcium due to avoidance of foods containing phosphorus and potassium. Lack of calcium {{can lead to}} renal osteodystrophy (bone weakening). On the other hand, too much calcium can cause calcification or calciphylaxis (calcium deposits {{in places such as}} the heart. Vitamin D is a <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamin,</b> meaning that excessive amounts can be damaging so it should be prescribed and monitored by a doctor.|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate lactating mothers' intake of <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> in free-living subjects {{and to what extent}} cod liver oil supplementation influences the maternal intake in a population with common intake of cod liver oil. The impact of maternal diet on the concentration of <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> in human milk was studied. METHODS: Dietary intake of 77 lactating women was investigated by 24 -hour diet recalls and breast-milk samples were taken at the same occasions. Breast milk samples were analyzed for <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins.</b> RESULTS: The median intakes were 927 microg/day for vitamin A, 5. 5 mg/day for vitamin E and 3. 3 microg/day for vitamin D. Maternal vitamin A, E and D intakes were higher when the diet was supplemented with cod liver oil. Icelandic breast milk was found to have high contents of vitamin A and E. Only vitamin D was too low in breast milk to meet the recommended intake for infants. Retinylpalmitate in relation to lipids correlated with maternal vitamin A intake (r = 0. 23, p < 0. 05). The group with cod liver oil supplementation had significantly lower levels of gamma-tocopherol in breast milk (p < 0. 01), whereas the supplementation did not affect other <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins.</b> CONCLUSION: The recommended intake of <b>fat-soluble</b> <b>vitamins</b> for lactating women can more easily be met with a cod liver oil supplementation than diet alone. Only vitamin D in human milk cannot meet the recommended intakes for infants, with normal breastfeeding. There is a relationship between the content of vitamins A and E in human milk and the maternal diet...|$|R
