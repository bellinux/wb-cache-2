25|$|The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala {{took nearly}} {{three years in a}} {{painstaking}} search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the ideal choice and the place was selected.|$|E

25|$|After {{her three}} miscarriages, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more and more}} {{unlikely}} that the queen would bear an heir. Royal advisors urged the monarch to seek a divorce, hoping that the new wife would be Protestant and fertile – but Charles refused. This eventually led to her being made a target by courtiers. Throughout his reign, Charles firmly dismissed the idea of divorcing Catherine, and she remained faithful to Charles throughout their marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject Ecce Homo arises after the time of St. Louis and {{the building of the}} Sainte-Chapelle. The Catholic Encyclopedia reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite as probable that this was only meant for a laurel wreath.|$|E
25|$|Its last refuge was {{dominated}} by endemic Guettarda insularis, Ilex socorroensis and Sideroxylon socorrense, as well as black cherry (Prunus serotina), Ficus cotinifolia fig trees and Psidium socorrense guavas, apparently all native on Socorro. At least {{at the time of}} the last record, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on intact understorey of Euphorbiaceae (spurges and relatives) and ferns, maybe because cats hunt less efficiently in these dense tangles. It is frugivorous and, as is often the case in Columbidae, might have played an important role in the reproduction of the trees which dominate its habitat. One of these (S. socorrense) is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. In particular, it was found to associate with the fig trees.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire Bears {{jumped on}} the quarter-final train just as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leaving the station, {{grabbing}} the ticket {{out of the hands}} of Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped them up with a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.|$|E
25|$|The third {{regional}} final matched up the top seeded North Carolina Tar Heels and {{the sixth}} seeded Badgers from Wisconsin. The Tar Heels started off hot {{in this one}} as Sean May and Rashad McCants scored at will. When point guard Raymond Felton garnered his second foul, head coach Roy Williams decided to pull him to prevent further foul trouble. Up 11 at the time, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the right move. Wisconsin would prove Williams wrong as they finished the half on an 11-0 run, tying the game at 44 heading into the half. The Tar Heels struggled to start the second half as hot as the first and trailed {{for the first time}} since the opening minutes of the game. Sparked by May's 29 points and 11 boards and Felton's clutch free throws, they outlasted the Badgers and won the game by six in regulation.|$|E

Denise Masters, Terry Lang and Heather Floyd, who {{knew each other}} from Norman, Oklahoma, coincidentally found {{themselves}} at OBU, and got involved in music. They sang in a vocal group called 'The Ouachitones,' which {{was made up of}} 14 girls. Within the group, the girls formed a trio, and after a sound check for an Ouachitones performance, the girls were singing a cappella when they were told by an onlooker that they should do something together. Shelley Phillips had come from Little Rock, Arkansas to OBU with a scholarship in vocal performance. She sang in a group called the Praise Singers, made up of four girls and four guys and they traveled around the country performing concerts. She became friends with Terry and Heather through Denise, who was her roommate and sister in the social club Chi Delta. After Heather, Terry and Denise made plans to form a trio and sing together over the summer, Denise went back to her dorm room and told Shelley about their summer plans. After Shelley suggested that the trio became a quartet, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the perfect fit.|$|E

25|$|The {{selection}} of Williamsport as county seat {{was a major}} controversy in {{the early history of}} Lycoming County. It involved a bitter rivalry between an old frontier town and an upstart town that was built on a swamp. The first commissioners and officers of Lycoming County had their first offices and held their first court in Jaysburg (now part of the Newberry section of Williamsport). Jaysburg was on the western side of Lycoming Creek on a high piece of land. The land to the east of Lycoming Creek was known as Deer Park and was quite swampy. Jaysburg was at the time the only sizable village west of Muncy. Although Muncy was and still is in Lycoming County, it was not considered as an option for county seathood, possibly due to its proximity to the southern and eastern borders of the county. Jaysburg's buildings were sufficient to serve as the first courthouse and jail in the history of Lycoming County. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most logical place for establishing a county seat, and many of its residents were sure that their town would indeed be the county seat. This was not to be. The county seat was awarded to a new community across the creek and Jaysburg soon disappeared from the map; its land was absorbed by the new city of Williamsport.|$|E
25|$|The Indian subcontinent {{has served}} as a stage for intense human and tiger confrontations. The region affording habitat where tigers have {{achieved}} their highest densities is also one which has housed one of the most concentrated and rapidly expanding human populations. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a question as to whether man or tiger would survive. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life. These animals were pushed into marginal habitat, where tigers had formerly not been known, or where they existed only in very low density, by an expanding population of more vigorous animals that occupied the prime habitat in the lowlands, where there was high prey density and good habitat for reproduction. The dispersers had no where else to go, since the prime habitat was bordered in the south by cultivation. They are thought to have followed back the herds of domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.|$|E

500|$|Toon Zone noted Shiotani's {{lack of a}} {{particular}} directing style, saying that it ultimately hurt the script and added nothing to the movie: main praise {{was given to the}} animation, aside from the CGI sequences, and Satō's more forceful and heroic musical score. It praised the story as [...] "moving yet intense" [...] despite Fumito's lack of presence, saying that it provided suitable closure for Saya and the storyline of Blood-C, but noting that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed as an apology to fans who were upset by the series' unconventional tone—this was noted in both the more sympathetic supporting cast, Saya's altered presentation, and the general toning down of blood and gore. The site ultimately felt that this attitude meant the conclusion was rushed and that the final battle was an unwise departure from the Blood franchise's previous realism.|$|E
