25|$|A {{electrode}} typically {{consists of}} carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion <b>ionomer,</b> and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the <b>ionomer</b> provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order {{to enable the}} electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must {{gain access to the}} surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (<b>ionomer)</b> and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading. The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.|$|E
40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} <b>ionomers</b> of Methacrylamidopropyltrimethyl {{ammonium chloride}} with N-substituted acrylamides were prepared at 55 ± 1 °C using azobiscyanovaleric acid (ACVA) initiator. The monomers and <b>ionomers</b> {{were characterized by}} 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy and the copolymer composition was calculated from elemental analysis data. The reduced viscosity of <b>ionomers</b> in methanol behaves as non-polyelectrolytes at lower mole percentage and as polyelectrolyte at higher mole percentage. The molecular weights of <b>ionomers</b> {{were found to be}} high and the polydispersity index values indicate termination mainly by disproportionation. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of <b>ionomers</b> were greater than those of the corresponding homopolymers, attributed to a reduction in segmental mobility.

Hence, they {{can be used as a}} treatment modality for patients who are at high risk for caries. Newer formulations of glass <b>ionomers</b> that contain light-cured resins can achieve a greater aesthetic result, but do not release fluoride as well as conventional glass <b>ionomers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before the {{invention}} of PEM fuel cells, existing fuel cell types such as solid-oxide fuel cells were only applied in extreme conditions. Such fuel cells also required very expensive materials and could only be used for stationary applications due to their size. These issues were addressed by the PEM fuel cell. The PEM fuel cell was invented in the early 1960s by Willard Thomas Grubb and Leonard Niedrach of General Electric. Initially, sulfonated polystyrene membranes were used for electrolytes, but they were replaced in 1966 by Nafion <b>ionomer,</b> which proved to be superior in performance and durability to sulfonated polystyrene.|$|E
500|$|After a tooth {{has been}} damaged or destroyed, {{restoration}} of the missing structure can be achieved {{with a variety of}} treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of materials, including glass <b>ionomer,</b> amalgam, gold, porcelain, and composite. Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as [...] "intracoronal restorations". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the lost-wax technique, such as for some inlays and onlays. When larger portions of a tooth are lost, an [...] "extracoronal restoration" [...] may be fabricated, such as an artificial crown or a veneer, to restore the involved tooth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Various {{studies have}} shown that glass <b>ionomers</b> are {{susceptible}} to brittle fracture and acid conditions and that they undergo long-term changes in their mechanical properties. Little information is available on how brittleness, acid susceptibility, and long-term changes are reflected in the wear characteristics of glass <b>ionomers.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate long-term changes in conventional glass <b>ionomers,</b> metal-reinforced glass <b>ionomers</b> (including a cermet), and (light-curing) resin-modified glass <b>ionomers</b> by wear experiments simulating the wear process in occlusal contact-free areas. The wear tests were conducted periodically over a period of one year. In addition, wear was determined after one year at a pH of 5 or 6, for assessment of acid susceptibility, and at a condition as found in the occlusal contact areas. All materials showed high early-wear rates which decreased significantly during the one-year test period. This long-term process may be related to a slow progression of the acid-base reaction extending over several months. At each stage, the resin-modified glass <b>ionomers</b> wore significantly faster than the acid-base setting glass <b>ionomers.</b> Most of these materials were not affected at a pH of 6. 0, while at a pH of 5. 0 only the conventional and the metal-reinforced glass <b>ionomers</b> showed increased wear. Direct contacts with the antagonist led to a significant increase in wear in comparison with contact-free wear, probably as a result of sub-surface fatigue phenomena. In view of the unfavorable wear characteristics of the resin-modified glass <b>ionomers</b> and the high early wear of the conventional glass <b>ionomers,</b> including the metal-reinforced glass <b>ionomers,</b> it was concluded that none of these materials can yet be recommended for use in high-stress-bearing situations.

40|$|Polystyrene-co- 4 -hydroxystyrene <b>ionomers</b> (3. 0 - 22 mol %) were {{synthesized}} via neutralization of demethylated polystyrene-co- 4 -methoxystyrene. The polystyrene-co- 4 -hydroxymethylstyrene <b>ionomers</b> (2. 5 - 19. 4 mol %) {{were prepared}} from the partial chloromethylation of polystyrene, followed by esterification, saponification, and finally neutralization. The physical {{properties of the}} <b>ionomers</b> {{as well as their}} nonionic precursors were studied by calorimetry, torsion pendulum and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Stress relaxation studies of the <b>ionomers</b> were also done. While evidence for ion aggregation was obtained for the styrene- 4 -hydroxystyrene <b>ionomers</b> from SAXS and torsion pendulum studies, no firm evidence was obtained for the styrene- 4 -hydroxymethylstyrene <b>ionomers.</b> Stress relaxation studies on both systems, however, showed failure of time-temperature superposition at high ion contents, indicating that these systems are both thermorheologically complex. The glass transition temperature of the matrix, the size of the ionic aggregates and the strengths of the ionic interactions within these large aggregates were related to the type and position of the ionic group...|$|R

50|$|Compomers release some {{fluoride}} ions, like a glass <b>ionomer</b> cement. The {{level of}} this fluoride release however is only around 10% of {{that of a}} glass <b>ionomer,</b> which makes it less useful for deciduous restorations. It {{has been shown to}} have no advantage over an amalgam restoration with a fluoride releasing bonding agent, which releases mercury and fluoride. Compomers also do not have the ability to 'recharge' their fluoride ion content with topically applied fluoride from toothpaste etc., like glass <b>ionomer</b> cements; this is another limit on their efficacy. Compomers are recommended for patients at medium risk of developing caries.|$|E

40|$|Because the proton {{conductivity}} σH is a {{key factor}} for both of catalyst layers and membranes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), choice of proton conducting <b>ionomers</b> is important to achieve high performance.

The importance of research on Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) based on new <b>ionomers</b> has been emphasized before, however, the incorporation of novel <b>ionomers</b> in GDEs has been reported only recently.

40|$|Ion-containing {{polymers}} are {{of intense}} interest for applications in energy storage and conversion devices. The conductivities of these polymers {{are determined by}} both the ion mobility and {{the total number of}} mobile charge carriers, which in turn depend on the chemical structure and morphology. To rationally design ion-containing polymers with high conductivity, a comprehensive understanding of their multi-scale structure is essential. ^ The morphologies of several ion-containing polymers have been explored as a function of material chemistry and external stimuli by X-ray scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and various types of spectroscopy. The fundamental structure-property relationships in ion-containing polymers are discussed. Two classes of ion-containing polymers with very different aggregation behaviors have been studied. The first class is the polystyrene-based <b>ionomers,</b> where there are unfavorable interactions between the polymer matrix and ionic groups. The ionic functional groups in these hydrocarbon-based <b>ionomers</b> self-assemble into ionic aggregates, due to the strong electrostatic interactions in the low dielectric constant matrix and the lack of any solvation interactions between ions and hydrocarbons. The effects of acid content, neutralization level, and cation type on the size, number density, and composition of ionic aggregates were explored. The morphological findings provide a framework for interpreting the dielectric relaxation behaviors of the same <b>ionomers,</b> so as to establish correlations between structure and dynamics. ^ The second class is poly(alkyl oxide) -based <b>ionomers.</b> The ionic groups have favorable interactions with the polymer matrix in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -based polyester <b>ionomers</b> or urethane groups in poly(tetramethylene oxide) -based polyurethane <b>ionomers.</b> The states of ions are highly dependent on the PEO length, cation size and temperature in PEO-based <b>ionomers.</b> Decreasing cation size from Cs to Li results in a transition of ionic states from isolated ion pairs to aggregated ion pairs. As the temperature increases, these <b>ionomers</b> exhibit greater microphase separation of the ionic groups due to the decreased ability of PEO to solvate the ions. These findings combine to greatly advance our understanding of the interplay between morphology and ion conduction in single-ion conductors. ...|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{composites}} {{were introduced}} in the 1980’s and are more commonly known as resin-modified glass <b>ionomer</b> cements (RMGICs). The material consists of a powder containing a radiopaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule. The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for Class II cavities. RMGICs can be used instead. This mixture or resin and glass <b>ionomer</b> allows the material to be set by light activation (resin), allowing a longer working time. It also has {{the benefit of the}} glass <b>ionomer</b> component releasing fluoride and has superior adhesive properties. RMGICs are now recommended over traditional GICs for basing cavities.

It is also now commonly {{used as an}} orthodontic bracket adhesive, either as a glass <b>ionomer,</b> or a glass ionomer-based cement. Glass-ionomer based cements are essentially hybrids of glass ionomers and another dental material, for example Resin-Modified Glass <b>Ionomer</b> Cements (RMGICs) and compomers (or modified composites). These materials {{are based on the}} reaction of silicate glass-powder (calciumaluminofluorosilicate glass)and polyalkenoic acid, an <b>ionomer.</b> Occasionally water is used instead of an acid, altering the properties of the material and its uses. This reaction produces a powdered cement of glass particles surrounded by matrix of fluoride elements and is known chemically as Glass Polyalkenoate. There are other forms of similar reactions which can take place, for example, when using an aqueous solution of acrylic/itaconic copolymer with Tartaric acid, this results in a glass-ionomer in liquid form.
