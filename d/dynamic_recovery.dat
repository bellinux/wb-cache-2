50|$|With {{increasing}} {{temperature and}} decreasing strain rate, quartz deformation can yield numerous microsturctures. Each microstructures represents different deformational process and condition which is grouped into three regimes: Bulging (BLG), Subgrain Rotation (SGR), and Grain Boundary Migration (GBM). As the deformation mechanisms changes from BLG, SGR, to GBM, the recrystallized grain sizes becomes larger. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery</b> and recrystallisation {{is the result}} of two processes: Subgrain Rotation and Grain Boundary Migration. Subgrain rotation means as the dislocation moves into the subgrain wall,the misorientation angle between two subgrains increases. Grain Boundary Migration makes the diffusion from one side of a grain boundary to the other happen.|$|E
5000|$|When metals are {{subjected}} to [...] "cold working" [...] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low {{as compared to the}} material's absolute melting temperature, Tm, i.e., typically less than 0.4 Tm) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new geometrically necessary dislocations and dislocation multiplication. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as strain hardening (also “work hardening”). Tangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery</b> leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15° (low angle grain boundaries). In addition, adding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.|$|E

40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{distinction}} between nanocrystal strengthening and Hall−Petch grain size strengthening which varies linearly with d− 1 / 2. The important role of grain boundary structure in the strengthening formation of nanomaterials is emphasized. Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>recoveries</b> are the main reasons limiting the minimal size of structural elements under deformation in high-deformed materials. Structural relaxation proceeding by the recovery mechanism during both the plastic deformation and unloading causes loss of strengthening in high-deformed materials.

In the microdeformation level the hardening stress is practically independent of previous deformation degrees in a wide interval of deformation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery</b> on the mechanical properties of copper (Cu) during surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) at both room temperature (RT) and cryogenic temperature (CT).

The temperature-strain dependence of the high-angle grain boundary fraction (HAGB%) was examined through electron backscattered diffraction. Results showed that as-rolled microstructures with high HAGB% may be obtained under average rolling temperatures of 270 – 320  °C, equivalent strains higher than 0. 8, and a rolling speed of 246  mm/s. These results {{may be related to the}} DRX kinetics and <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery</b> which are controlled by deformation temperature and strain. HAGB% decreased with increasing rolling time (decreasing rolling speed), which is attributed to <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery,</b> and the recrystallized grain size decreased as rolling time increased. However, further increases in rolling time increased average grain sizes but decreased mean subgrain sizes; these results are attributed to increases in the low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) length per unit area with rolling time. LAGB formation was controlled by <b>dynamic</b> <b>recovery,</b> which consistently follows polygonization or formation of new subgrains inside larger grains; hence, average subgrain sizes decreased with the rolling time.
