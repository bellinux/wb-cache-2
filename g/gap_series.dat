Trigiani also wrote the Viola books, about a clever teenage filmmaker from Brooklyn, for young adults. Trigiani's acclaimed stand-alone novels include Lucia, Lucia (2003), The Queen of the Big Time (2004), and Rococo (2005). Trigiani's book The Shoemaker's Wife is the fictional account of the lives of her own grandparents after emigrating to America from Italy in the early 20th century. Regularly on the New York Times Bestsellers list, critics have noted Trigiani's ability to [...] "create distinctive voices for each of her characters." [...] Millions of copies of Trigiani's books are in print in the United States and published in 36 countries around the world. Overlapping themes include self-perception, social identity, the universal immigrant story, personal loss, working class life, and contemporary social and environmental issues. Since 2012, Adriana Trigiani Tours, and AT Escapes, have offered travel tours to Italy, Scotland, Spain and Gibraltar inspired by the novels of Adriana Trigiani.|$|E

We show that if u∈ h^∞_v is represented by a Hadamard <b>gap</b> <b>series,</b> then u will grow slower than v or oscillate along almost all radii.

40|$|A major {{criticism}} of standard specifications of price adjustment in models for monetary policy analysis {{is that they}} violate the natural rate hypothesis by allowing output to differ from potential in steady state. In this paper we estimate a dynamic optimizing business cycle model whose price-setting behavior satisfies the natural rate hypothesis. The priceadjustment specifications we consider are the sticky-information specification of Mankiw and Reis (2002) and the indexed contracts of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). Our empirical estimates of the real side of the economy are similar whichever price adjustment specification is chosen. Consequently, the alternative model specifications deliver similar estimates of the U. S. output <b>gap</b> <b>series,</b> but the empirical behavior of the <b>gap</b> <b>series</b> differs substantially from standard gap estimates. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{constructed}} a real-time data-set for German GNP/GDP (1973 Q 1 to 1998 Q 4), {{which had not}} existed before, in order to estimate real-time output gaps for Germany. These real-time output gaps are then compared to ex- post estimated output <b>gap</b> <b>series.</b> We find that there are significant differences between them. The size of the difference depends on the method with which potential output is estimated. Real-time and ex-post output <b>gap</b> <b>series</b> are then used for computing and estimating Taylor rules {{in order to assess}} the different implications they have for monetary policy decisions.

40|$|Understanding {{the degree}} of {{measurement}} error in the estimates of the output gap available to policy-makers in 'real time' is important both for the formulation of monetary policy and {{for the study of}} inflation behaviour. For the United Kingdom, no official output <b>gap</b> <b>series</b> exists, but an approximate series can be deduced from analysis of statistical releases and policy-makers' statements. On this basis, a real-time UK output <b>gap</b> <b>series</b> is constructed, beginning in 1965, and it is therefore possible to obtain estimates of the extent of real-time output gap mismeasurement in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Monetary policy errors due to output gap mismeasurement are found to have contributed approximately 3. 0 to 7. 1 percentage points to average UK inflation in the 1970 s and 0. 7 to 5. 5 percentage points to inflation in the 1980 s. ...|$|E
