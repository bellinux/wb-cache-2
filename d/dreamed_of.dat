Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E

Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E

At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E
