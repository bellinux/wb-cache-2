This is useful in blood vessels, the lungs, in skin, and the ligamentum nuchae, and these tissues contain high amounts of <b>elastins.</b> <b>Elastins</b> are synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. <b>Elastins</b> are highly insoluble, and tropoelastins are secreted inside a chaperone molecule, which releases the precursor molecule upon contact with a fiber of mature elastin.

Upon injury, elastic fibers are not readily replaced, which hampers tissue regeneration. Incorporation of solubilized <b>elastin</b> (hydrolyzed insoluble <b>elastin</b> fibers or <b>elastin</b> peptides) in biomaterials may improve regeneration, because solubilized <b>elastin</b> is able to promote proliferation as well as <b>elastin</b> synthesis. Porous biomaterials composed of highly purified collagen without and without <b>elastin</b> fibers or solubilized <b>elastin</b> were prepared by freezing and lyophilization. Solubilized <b>elastin</b> formed spherical structures that were incorporated in the collagenous part of the scaffolds and that persisted after chemical crosslinking of the scaffolds. Crosslinked scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in young Sprague Dawley rats. Collagen-solubilized <b>elastin</b> and collagen scaffolds showed no calcification in this sensitive calcification model, in contrast to scaffolds containing <b>elastin</b> fibers. Collagen-solubilized <b>elastin</b> scaffolds also induced angiogenesis, as revealed by type IV collagen staining, and promoted elastic fiber synthesis, as shown with antibodies against rat <b>elastin</b> and fibrillin- 1.

40|$|Fetal bovine {{ligamentum nuchae}} {{fibroblasts}} maintained in culture synthesized soluble <b>elastin</b> but {{were unable to}} form the insoluble elastic fiber. Secreted <b>elastin</b> precursors accumulated in culture medium and were measured using a radioimmunoassay for <b>elastin.</b> When <b>elastin</b> production was examined in ligament tissue from fetal calves of various gestational ages, cells from tissue taken during the last trimester of development produced significantly more <b>elastin</b> than did cells from younger fetal tissue, with maximal <b>elastin</b> synthesis occurring shortly before birth. Soluble <b>elastin</b> was detected in ligament cells plated at low density until proliferation began to be density inhibited and the cells became quiescent. Also, soluble <b>elastin</b> production per cell declined with increasing population doubling or with age in culture. Cells grown {{in the presence of}} 5 % fetal calf serum produced approximately four times as much soluble <b>elastin</b> as cells grown in serum-free medium. The addition of dexamethasone (0. 1 microM) and bleomycin (1 microgram/ml) increased soluble <b>elastin</b> production by cultured cells 180 % and 50 %, respectively, whereas theophylline (5 micrograms/ml) depressed production 50 % and antagonized stimulation by dexamethasone. Ascorbate (50 micrograms/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml), insulin (100 microunits/ml), and aminoacetonitrile (50 micrograms/ml) had no effect, but cycloheximide at 10 (- 4) M completely inhibited soluble <b>elastin</b> production. In contrast to cells in culture, ligament tissue minces (ligament cells surrounded by in vivo extracellular matrix) efficiently incorporated soluble <b>elastin</b> precursors into insoluble, cross-linked <b>elastin.</b> In addition, soluble <b>elastin</b> production per cell (per microgram of DNA) was higher in tissue minces than <b>elastin</b> production by cells maintained on plastic.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the lamprin {{family of}} proteins consists of several lamprin proteins from the Sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus.

40|$|Arterial <b>elastin</b> {{appears to}} be a proteinlipid complex with the lipid {{component}} being bound to <b>elastin</b> peptide groups. In atherosclerotic lesions the lipid content of <b>elastin</b> increases progressively with increasing severity of atherosclerosis. The increases in the lipid content of plaque <b>elastin</b> are mainly due to large increases in cholesterol with about 80 % of the cholesterol being cholesterol ester. This deposition of cholesterol in <b>elastin</b> accounts for a substantial part of the total cholesterol accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions of all stages. The present in vitro study suggests that the mechanism involved in the deposition of lipids in arterial <b>elastin</b> may be an interaction of the <b>elastin</b> protein with serum or arterial low density or very low density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) resulting in a transfer of lipids, but not of lipoprotein protein to the <b>elastin.</b> No significant lipid transfer occurred from the high density lipoproteins or chylomicrons.

40|$|Abstract—Diseases {{linked to}} the <b>elastin</b> gene arise from loss-of-function {{mutations}} leading to protein insufficiency (supravalvular aortic stenosis) or from missense mutations that alter {{the properties of the}} <b>elastin</b> protein (dominant cutis laxa). Modeling these diseases in mice is problematic because of structural differences between the human and mouse genes. To address this problem, we developed a humanized <b>elastin</b> mouse with <b>elastin</b> production being controlled by the human <b>elastin</b> gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the human transgene mirrors the endogenous murine gene, and the human gene accurately recapitulates the alternative-splicing pattern found in humans. Human <b>elastin</b> protein interacts with mouse <b>elastin</b> to form functional elastic fibers and when expressed in the <b>elastin</b> haploinsufficient background reverses the hypertension and cardiovascular changes associated with that phenotype. <b>Elastin</b> from the human transgene also rescues the perinatal lethality associated with the null phenotype.

Equi- and nonequi-biaxial tests were performed to study the effect of different loading conditions on the stress–strain responses of the <b>elastin</b> network. The mechan-ical properties of different <b>elastin</b> sections along the thoracic aorta were examined and studied to understand the anisot-ropy of <b>elastin</b> along the whole artery. Biaxial tensile test data comparing <b>elastin</b> vs. intact aorta showed that <b>elastin</b> is mainly responsible for the linear elastic response of the arterial wall at lower strains. Experimental results revealed that <b>elastin</b> network possesses significant anisotropic {{mechanical properties}} with the circumferential direction being stiffer than the longitudinal direction.

One of the major components of the vascular matrix is <b>elastin,</b> which confers vessels with the specialized property of stretch and recoil. <b>Elastin</b> deficiency has been implicated in many vascular diseases and determined experimentally to be a negative regulator of smooth muscle cell proliferation. In zebrafish, two <b>elastin</b> genes have been identified, which are actively expressed during development. Based on this finding, protein production and spatial localization for the two <b>elastin</b> proteins was studied by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies. Results revealed a global distribution for <b>elastin</b> 1 in the ventral aorta and swim bladder, whereas <b>elastin</b> 2 was preferentially localized to the bulbus arteriosus indicating a possible specialized function of <b>elastin</b> 2 in this structure. This observation, and the unique physiological property of this structure, suggests a possible reason for the preservation of both <b>elastin</b> genes during evolution. In the second part of this study, elastin-null mice were studied to uncover the impact of the loss of <b>elastin</b> on the expression of other elastic fiber-associated proteins. The expression of fibrillin- 1, the major component of microfibrils, was not altered in the absence of <b>elastin,</b> implying that <b>elastin</b> is not necessary for the formation of microfibrils. On the other hand, both fibulin- 2 and - 5 were upregulated in the absence of <b>elastin,</b> suggesting that expression of these genes are controlled by <b>elastin.</b> Overall, this study highlights the importance of <b>elastin</b> in evolution, as well as its potential role in the regulation of expression of other matrix molecules...|$|R

Aortae and other tissues from several vertebrates and invertebrates were examined for the presence of elastin, which was defined on the basis of a characteristic amino acid composition, the presence of the unique crosslinks desmosine and isodesmosine, and by histologic criteria. The protein was present in all vertebrates except the primitive jawless fishes and was absent from all invertebrates which were examined. In addition, the morphology of aortic elastin fibers differed markedly among the vertebrate families. Biochemical analysis revealed increases in both the degree of crosslinking and hydrophobicity in <b>elastins</b> from higher vertebrates (mammals, birds) as compared to those from bony fish. Mammalian elastin displayed an increased tendency toward coacervation (polymerization into aggregated structures) at 37 °C and behaved differently from a conventional elastomer when stretched in a microcalorimeter. Selection for an increasingly hydrophobic elastin appears to have paralleled the development of a highly-pressurized, closed circulatory system in homeothermic animals. The data do not support a common genetic origin for elastin and other connective tissue proteins. Significant variations in amino acid composition among aortic <b>elastins</b> from different species, however, indicate that genetically distinct elastin types could have arisen by divergence from a common ancestral gene...|$|E
40|$|Val-Val-Pro-Gln (valyl-valyl-prolyl-glutamine) is a {{small but}} highly conserved {{sequence}} present in all <b>elastins.</b> We describe its synthesis by mixed anhydride solution chemistry {{as an alternative to}} solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The molecular structure of the tetrapeptide in solution was investigated by classical spectroscopy, such as circular dichroism (CD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The biological activity of Val-Val-Pro-Gln was evaluated by a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay with normal human dermal fibroblasts. This small peptide may {{play a critical role in}} control of matrix metabolism through its release from the elastin polypeptide chain during periods of tissue breakdown and remodelling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter isolation, purification, and radiolabeling of elastin from baboon aorta and lung, {{the rates}} of {{hydrolysis}} of both H- 3 -labeled <b>elastins</b> by porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) or by human leukocyte elastase (HLE) were compared. PPE (30 nM) degraded aorta and lung <b>elastins</b> at rates of 40 and 75 mu g/h, respectively, leading to their complete solubilization. In contrast, the low rate of hydrolysis of lung elastin (10 mu g/h) by HLE was paradoxically accompanied with a fivefold decrease in the Michaelis constant value and became negligible after 1 h of incubation. Moreover, HLE adsorption isotherms showed that 0. 87 nmol HLE was adsorbed on 1 mg of aorta elastin vs. 1. 30 nmol/mg lung elastin. Also, increasing ionic strength was found to enhance the elastolytic potential of HLE toward lung elastin. Investigations were carried out to explain why baboon lung elastin exhibited low susceptibility to hydrolysis by HLE. Solubilization of lung elastin with PPE produced a residue that exhibited inhibitory capacity toward HLE when either H- 3 -labeled aorta elastin or succinyl trialanine nitroanilide {{was used as a}} substrate. When analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, this residue was found to consist of several mineral dust particles, mainly kaolinite (53 %) of environmental origin. The HLE-inhibitory capacities of various mineral or coal mine dust particles were then analyzed. Mineral aluminum-silicate dusts were found to be potent HLE inhibitors: 5 mu g of either kaolinite or montmorillonite totally abolished the activity of 0. 45 mu g of HLE. All these results allowed us to propose that HLE inhibition by aluminum-silicate dusts may be of importance in the pathogenesis of industrial pneumoconiosis and in opportunistic lung infection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{clinical}} investigations <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration {{has been proposed}} as one potential marker of lung <b>elastin</b> degradation. No epidemiological study has yet confirmed this hypothesis. METHODS: The relation of <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration to some factors closely related to pulmonary emphysema (age, smoking habits, FEV 1 alpha protease inhibitor (PI) phenotype) and to alcohol consumption was examined in an epidemiological study of 310 working men. The <b>elastin</b> peptides used for obtaining antibodies and as reference in an ELISA assay were prepared from chemically hydrolysed <b>elastin.</b> RESULTS: The <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration significantly decreased with age from 2. 92 (1. 54) micrograms/ml among subjects younger than 30 years to 2. 18 (1. 14) micrograms/ml among subjects older than 50. <b>Elastin</b> peptide concentration did not differ with smoking habits and was clearly unrelated to FEV 1. A lower <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration was observed in all groups of subjects with a protease inhibitor phenotype other than PI MM (PI FM, IM, MP, MS, MZ, and S phenotypes). CONCLUSIONS: The results cast doubts on {{the usefulness of the}} <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration as a marker of lung destruction in middle aged, predominantly healthy men. Blood <b>elastin</b> peptide concentration may reflect both <b>elastin</b> degradation and resynthesis. The results of this analysis suggest that several factors (age, alcohol consumption, non-PI MM phenotype) may be associated with decreased resynthesis of lung <b>elastin.</b> Further studies, conducted in various age groups and including estimates of the degree of lung destruction, are needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying lysis and resynthesis of lung <b>elastin...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fetal bovine {{ligamentum nuchae}} {{fibroblasts}} maintained in culture synthesized soluble <b>elastin</b> but {{were unable to}} form the insoluble elastic fiber. Secreted <b>elastin</b> precursors accumulated in culture medium and were measured using a radioimmunoassay for <b>elastin.</b> When <b>elastin</b> production was examined in ligament tissue from fetal calves of various gesta-tional ages, cells from tissue taken during the last trimester of development produced signifi-cantly more <b>elastin</b> than did cells from younger fetal tissue, with maximal <b>elastin</b> synthesis occurring shortly before birth. Soluble <b>elastin</b> was not detected in ligament cells plated at low density until proliferation began to be density inhibited and the cells became quiescent. Also, soluble <b>elastin</b> production per cell declined with increasing population doubling or with age in culture. Cells grown {{in the presence of}} 5 % fetal calf serum produced approximately four times as much soluble <b>elastin</b> as cells grown in serum-free medium. The addition of dexamethasone (0. 1 pM) and bleomycin (1 gg/ml) increased soluble <b>elastin</b> production by cultured cells 180 % and 50 %, respectively, whereas theophylline (5 ftg/ml) depressed production 50 % and antago-nized stimulation by dexamethasone.

40|$|Purification {{protocols}} for <b>elastin</b> generally {{result in}} greatly damaged <b>elastin</b> fibers and this likely influences the biological response. We here describe a novel protocol for {{the isolation of}} <b>elastin</b> whereby the fibers stay intact, and introduce the term "elastin fiber" for intact elastic fibers with <b>elastin</b> as their sole component. As opposed to elastic fibers, <b>elastin</b> fibers do not contain any microfibrils or associated molecules. <b>Elastin</b> fibers were isolated from equine elastic ligaments according to various protocols and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid quantification, immunofluorescence assay, transmission/scanning electron microscopy, and cellular reactivity in vivo. The optimal protocol comprised several extraction steps and trypsin digestion. <b>Elastin</b> fibers were free of contaminants and had a smooth, regular appearance. The cellular response to purified, intact <b>elastin</b> fibers was different in comparison with purified, but affected, fibers and to contaminated fibers. Intact fibers consisting only of <b>elastin</b> may be important for both fundamental and applied research, for example, tissue engineering, which need well-defined preparations to study the cellular biological effect of individual components...|$|R
