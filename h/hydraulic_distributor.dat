40|$|The {{effect of}} {{steady-state}} axial flow-forces on {{the motion of}} an open center <b>hydraulic</b> <b>distributor</b> notched spool is considered. More in details, the spring driven spool centering is considered, in which undesired axial flow-forces could overcome the spring action. A steady-state analysis of the forces influencing the spool motion is reported, calculating the axial flow-force for different positions of the spool. Different notched shapes of the metering edge are considered, and an optimized solution for the notched edge of the spool is proposed at last...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{mechanical}} system {{to detect the}} static wheel weight of the railway bogie using hydraulic pressure has been designed. Wheel weight can be acquired by a pressure sensor mounted on the <b>hydraulic</b> pressure <b>distributor</b> and displayed by a wheel load indicator with a resolution of 0. 1 KN when the hydraulic pressure induced from the hydraulic hand pump lifts a wheel by mechanical components connected with the hydraulic pressure cylinder. The measurable wheel load is 100 KN. Also, a height indicator which is attached on the wheel using a magnet shows the elevated height of the wheel from the rail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{issues are}} {{discussed}} in the paper. The first one concerns the FEM modelling of the magnetic field enclosing the permanent magnet – reed switch system. The system works as the motion detection device of the <b>hydraulic</b> servoactuator <b>distributor</b> to improve the helicopter steering reliability and flight safety. The second one describes optimization of the active magnetic bearing (AMB) design with the FEM. The optimization has two goals: weight reduction and bearing load capacity. The bearing is applied to active vibration control of helicopter flexible tail rotor shaft. Introduction to part I: FEM modelling of the magnetic field in the hydraulic servoactuator slider motion detection system Hydraulic servoactuators are common devices in control systems of rotating machinery. In some special applications of hydraulic servoactuators, it is desirable to detect their slider motion with 0. 05 – 0. 3 mm precision level. Former solutions were based on pure mechanical ideas so they had on...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a new cast iron {{hydraulic}} component is problematic. Usually the fluid power components are made using cast iron, in order to overcome the complexity related to the ducts geometry. Direct observations and empirical investigations during casting are difficult and expensive to make. Usually direct methods are replaced by using physical and/or mathematical modelling. A yet unsolved problem is predicting the fatigue life of the cast component. In this paper will be showed the preliminary results of a study carried out with the aim to investigate the fatigue behavior of a cast <b>hydraulic</b> <b>distributor.</b> The geometry optimization performed to reduce the local stress concentration and the first metallographic analyses on the broken sample have been showed. The results of simulations have been compared with the experimental analysis on the same component, obtaining a good correspondence. The presented work {{is part of the}} European project FLEXICAST (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013 grant agreement n° 314540), which is ongoing and will be finished in November 2016...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental results {{of studies on}} the influence of shape and number of spool notches on the discharge characteristics (discharge coefficient, velocity coefficient and flow angle) of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>distributor</b> metering edge. The flow rate vs. pressure drop and the steady state axial flow-force vs. pressure drop diagrams are determined for spools with different configurations of multiple notched metering edges. Various combinations of the shape and number of the notches modulating the metering area of the passage between supply and drain ports were investigated and correlated with flow rate, axial flow force and pressure drop, in order to get estimates of discharge coefficient and flow angle. The procedure is applied to all the data collected during the experimental activity, and shows the behaviour of the flow characteristics in both fully turbulent and transitional region of motion. The influence of notch shape and number on the metering edge flow characteristics is evaluated as well...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some results}} obtained during the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim {{of the work is}} to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>distributor</b> and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented...|$|E
