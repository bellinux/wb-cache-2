In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> tax credit, and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> tax credit.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} by a United States child psychiatrist, Dr Kyle D. Pruett, found that infants between 7 and 30 months responded more favorably to being picked up by their fathers. Pruett also found that a father's parenting style is beneficial for a child's physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral development. Mothers reassure toddlers when they become frustrated while fathers encourage them to manage their frustration. This helps the children {{learn to deal with}} stress and frustration. A long-term study Pruett conducted proved that a father's active involvement with his children, from birth to adolescence, promotes greater emotional balance, stronger curiosity and a stronger sense of self-assurance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E

There she entrusted his education to her father, a farmer and schoolteacher, who provided his elementary education, taught him Malagasy proverbs and stories, introduced him to Christianity, and taught him to paint and play music. Razakandrainy's grandfather taught him the history of their royal family line and the people of the Anjanapara valley in southern Imerina.

5|$|When the 20-year-old Sue Ellen Shepard {{wins the}} title of Miss Texas in 1967, she meets her future husband, J.R. Ewing, who is a judge for the pageant. After a courtship, they marry on February 15, 1970, but after several years, their {{marriage}} deteriorates, {{due in large part}} to J.R.'s numerous extramarital affairs and his disinterest in her. In 1978, a lonely Sue Ellen begins an affair with J.R.'s nemesis, Cliff Barnes. Shortly thereafter, Sue Ellen finds herself pregnant and believes that Cliff is the father because she and J.R. had been married for years without conceiving, and by this point, they barely had marital relations. Sue Ellen believes she loves Cliff, but is unable to leave J.R. To console herself, she starts drinking heavily during her pregnancy. Worried about the safety of her unborn child, J.R. has Sue Ellen committed to a sanitarium in 1979, to gain sobriety. However, Sue Ellen manages to continue drinking and escapes from the sanitarium drunk and crashes a car. While in the hospital, she gives birth to a son, John Ross Ewing III. After her son's birth, Sue Ellen becomes severely depressed and shows no interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} abnormal Technetium Tc 99 m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (Tc 99 m DMSA) renal scintigraphy findings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with urinary tract infection (UTI), and to evaluate the difference between <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with UTI and vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR), and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with UTI without VUR. Methods. Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was performed in 170 children with UTI, mean age 7. 07 years (1 month to 14 years, 137 were girls and 33 were boys). <b>In</b> 88 of <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> VUR was proved by micturating cystouretherography (MCU), while in 82 VUR could not be detected by MCU. VUR was graded in accordance with MCU recommended by the international study of VUR. <b>In</b> 13 of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>the</b> grade of VUR was grade I, in 30 was grade II, in 23 grade III, in 17 grade IV, while the grade V was <b>in</b> 5 of <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> Findings of Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy were classified as: 1 - normal, 2 - probably normal, 3 - equivocal, 4 - probably abnormal, and 5 - abnormal. The degree {{of the significance of}} the difference of the findings was estimated using χ 2, taking p < 0. 01 as the limit of statistical significance. Results. Of the total number of 170 studied <b>children,</b> <b>the</b> abnormal findings were detected in 30 % (51 / 170), normal findings in 62 % (106 / 170), and equivocal in 8 % (13 / 170). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with UTI and VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 49 % (43 / 88), of normal 43 % (38 / 88), and of equivocal findings 8 % (7 / 88). All <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade V had the abnormal findings (the incidence of the abnormal findings was 100 %). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade IV, the abnormal findings were 71 %. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade I, 77 % of the findings were normal, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade II, 53 % of the findings were normal and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade III, 30 % of the findings of renal scintigraphy were normal. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with UTI without VUR, the incidence of abnormal findings was 10 % (8 / 82), of normal findings 83 % (68 / 82), and of equivocal findings 7 % (6 / 82). The incidence of abnormal findings was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with UTI and VUR than in those with UTI without VUR (p < 0. 01). Also, the incidence of the abnormal findings was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grades IV and V than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with VUR grade I (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. DMSA renal scintigraphy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with ITU revealed <b>the</b> abnormal findings <b>in</b> 30 % of the cases. The incidence of the abnormal findings was significantly higher when VUR was present, as well as if the grade of VUR was higher. Our results confirmed that Tc 99 m DMSA renal scintigraphy was a very important technique <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> with ITU...|$|R

In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services, including healthcare based upon race and social class, and the resultant health inequities. Further, evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries.
