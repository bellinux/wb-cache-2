At the end of October, Tristan ran twice at the Newmarket Houghton meeting without reproducing his best form. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap he carried top weight of 130 pounds and finished seventh of the thirty-one runners behind Hackness. On his final {{start of the year}} he ran in the Jockey Club Stakes over two and a quarter miles. In a closely contested four way finish he dead-heated for second place with City Arab, a short head behind Chippendale and a neck in front of the mare Corrie Roy.|$|E

25|$|Westward bound {{settlers}} took Dutch ovens with them. A <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{was among}} the gear Lewis and Clark carried when they explored the great American Northwest in 1804–1806. Mormon pioneers who settled the American West also took along their Dutch ovens. In fact, a statue raised to honor the Mormon handcart companies who entered Utah’s Salt Lake Valley in the 1850s proudly displays a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> hanging {{from the front of}} the handcart. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> is also the official state cooking pot of Texas, Utah and Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are heavy, {{relatively}} deep pots {{with a heavy}} lid, {{designed to}} re-create oven conditions on the stovetop or campfire. They {{can be used for}} stews, braised meats, soups and a large variety of other dishes that benefit from low heat, slow cooking. <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are typically made from cast iron or Natural Clay and are sized by volume.|$|R

25|$|When cooking over a campfire, it is {{possible}} to use old-style lipped cast-iron <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> as true baking ovens, to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller baking pan can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible to stack <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as 5 or 6 pots.|$|R
25|$|Where possible, a {{cleaned and}} freshly oiled <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> should {{be stored in}} a clean, dry {{location}} with the lid ajar or off to promote air circulation and to avoid the smell and taste of rancid oil. If the <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> must be stored with the lid on, a paper towel or piece of newspaper should be placed inside the oven to absorb any moisture.|$|E
25|$|Dutch ovens {{are well}} suited for long, slow cooking, such as in making roasts, stews, and casseroles. Virtually any recipe that can be cooked in a {{conventional}} oven can be cooked in a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Australia, a bedourie camp oven is a steel cookpot {{shaped and}} used like a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven.</b> Named after Bedourie, Queensland, the Bedourie ovens were {{developed}} as a more robust (non-breakable) alternative to the more fragile cast-iron Dutch ovens.|$|E

25|$|A Wonder Pot is an Israeli {{invention}} {{that acts}} as a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> but is made of aluminium. It consists of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a centre hole that is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.|$|E
25|$|A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{has three}} legs, a wire bail handle, and a {{slightly}} concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below. This provides more uniform internal heat and lets the inside act as an oven. These ovens are typically made of bare cast iron, although some are aluminum. Dutch ovens are often used in Scouting outdoor activities.|$|E

50|$|When {{identifying}} various utensils, {{know that}} skillets are always {{of a larger}} diameter, with a shallow depth and a single long handle. Sauce pans will have a relative depth, and also a single long handle. Stock Pots are generally four quarts or larger, and have two smaller handles for grasping at each side. <b>Dutch</b> <b>Ovens</b> are similarly constructed, but feature a flared edge {{at the top of}} the pot with a narrow seat for their larger, more pronouncedly domed lid to seal. The domed lids used for <b>Dutch</b> <b>Ovens</b> (and square Skillets) are distinctly different in shape than that of the traditional bell-lipped Stainless Steel lids. The walls of these Domed lids are noticeably taller than standard utensil lids.|$|R

"I never thought," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, as she {{sat down}} at the tea-pot, [...] "that the heathens had so many conveniences, {{specially}} bakin'-powders and <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens.</b> For my part, I always supposed that they used their altars for bakin', when they wasn't offerin' up victims on 'em." ...|$|R
25|$|In the Netherlands, a <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. An other name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
500|$|On 7 June at Royal Ascot he contested the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most {{important}} staying race. Fordham sent {{him into the}} lead {{a mile from the}} finish and he won easily by three lengths from <b>Dutch</b> <b>Oven</b> and Wallenstein. On {{the last day of the}} Royal meeting he took the lead on the turn into the straight and won by a length and a half from Iroquois and eight others under top weight of 138 pounds to take his second Hardwicke Stakes. His winning time of 2:37 was considered exceptionally fast for the date. By this time he was being described as [...] "about the best horse of the day in England", and [...] "the present champion of the English turf", although he was also called [...] "a bad horse to ride". An example of Tristan's problematic behaviour came on Newmarket Heath that summer when he attacked a horse named Gratin, who was acting as his training companion. Gratin was left lame whilst his rider, whom Tristan also attempted to savage, escaped with a black eye. Another of Tristan's [...] "victims" [...] was a stable boy, whom he reportedly [...] "shook like a rat". His poor behaviour was blamed for contributing to his two defeats at Newmarket in July.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> is a {{thick-walled}} cooking {{pot with}} a tight-fitting lid. Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron, however some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium, or are ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled {{rather than being}} seasoned. Dutch ovens {{have been used as}} cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English speaking countries other than the United States ("casserole" [...] means [...] "pot" [...] in French), and cocottes in French. They are similar to both the Japanese tetsunabe and the Sač, a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African Potjie and the Australian Bedourie oven.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> were {{traditionally}} {{specially designed}} for camping, and such pots (often with legs and a handle, both for suspending the pot over a fire) are still widely available, though sometimes {{at a premium}} over flat-bottomed stove-top models. The oven is placed in a bed of hot coals, often from a keyhole fire with additional coals placed {{on top of the}} lid, which in camp ovens usually has a raised rim to keep the coals from falling off. <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are made of cast iron or aluminium, and are generally not considered suitable for backpacking due to the heavy weight of the pot. <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> are convenient for cooking dishes that take a long time such as stews, joints of meat and baked goods. They are not the only option for baking on a campout as devices for baking on portable stoves exist and clay ovens can be constructed at longer encampments.A pot hanging over the fire, although picturesque, may spill, and the rigging may be difficult to construct from found wood. Generally this is done with metal rigging, much of it identical to that historically used in home fireplaces before the invention of stoves. Two vertical iron bars with an iron cross-piece allow pots to be hung at various heights or over different temperatures of fire. Griddles, grills and skewers can also be hung over the fire. When working with wood, one may use two tripods, lashed with tripod lashings, but the rope will be liable to melt or burn. Dovetail joints are more secure, but difficult to carve.|$|R
25|$|American <b>Dutch</b> <b>ovens</b> {{changed over}} time during the colonial era. These changes {{included}} a shallower pot, legs to hold the oven above the coals, and a lid flange to keep the coals on the lid {{and out of the}} food. Paul Revere is credited with the design of the flat lid with a ridge for holding coals as well as the addition of legs to the pots.|$|R
50|$|Cast-iron {{cookware}} {{is valued}} for its heat retention properties, {{and can be}} produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology. Seasoning is used to protect bare cast iron from rust {{and to create a}} non-stick surface. Types of bare cast-iron cookware include panini presses, waffle irons, crepe makers, <b>dutch</b> <b>ovens,</b> frying pans, deep fryers, tetsubin, woks, potjies, karahi, flattop grills and griddles.|$|R
