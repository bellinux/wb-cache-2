50|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused <b>his</b> <b>hotel</b> efforts on courting the {{convention}} and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> minimal, so as to encourage guests {{to spend as much}} time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all <b>his</b> <b>hotel</b> <b>rooms</b> made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling. And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.|$|R
