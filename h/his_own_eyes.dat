5|$|In December 1554, Ambrose and Robert Dudley {{took part}} in a tournament held to {{celebrate}} Anglo-Spanish friendship. Yet, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there, otherwise they were even suspected of associating with people who conspired against Mary's regime. In January 1557 Robert and Amy Dudley were allowed to repossess some of their former lands, and in March of the same year Dudley was at Calais where he was chosen to deliver personally to Queen Mary the happy news of Philip's return to England. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley, the youngest brother, fought for PhilipII at the Battle of St. Quentin in August 1557. Henry Dudley was killed in the following siege by a cannonball—according to Robert, before <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> All surviving Dudley children—Ambrose and Robert with their sisters Mary and Katherine—were restored in blood by Mary I's next parliament in 1558.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes faced {{competition}} for the Matabeleland mining concession from George Cawston and Lord Gifford, two London financiers. They appointed as their agent Edward Arthur Maund, who had served with Sir Charles Warren in Bechuanaland between 1884 and 1885, {{towards the end of}} this time visiting Lobengula as an official British envoy. Cawston and Gifford's base in England gave them the advantage of better connections with Whitehall, while Rhodes's location in the Cape allowed him to see the situation with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b> He also possessed formidable financial capital and closer links with the relevant colonial administrators. In May 1888, Cawston and Gifford wrote to Lord Knutsford, the British Colonial Secretary, seeking his approval for their designs.|$|E

50|$|Independent from Young, George Biddell Airy {{discovered}} {{the phenomenon of}} astigmatism on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eye.</b> Airy presented <b>his</b> observations on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eye</b> in February 1825 at the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Airy produced lenses to correct his vision problems by 1825, while other sources put this into 1827 when Airy obtained cylindrical lenses from an optician from Ipswich. The name for the condition was not given by Airy, but from William Whewell.|$|R

25|$|Pompous British {{newspaper}} magnate Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) forbids his would-be aviatrix daughter, ardent suffragette Patricia (Sarah Miles), from flying. Aviator Richard Mays (James Fox), a young {{army officer}} and (at least in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes)</b> Patricia's fiancé, conceives {{the idea of}} an air race from London to Paris to advance the cause of British aviation (and his career). With Patricia's support, he persuades Lord Rawnsley to sponsor the race as a publicity stunt for his newspaper. Rawnsley, who takes full credit for the idea, announces the event to the press, shocking everyone with the amount of the prize.|$|E
25|$|John Cutting Berry, another missionary of the American Board, {{directed}} {{not only}} the International Hospital of Kobe but also Kobe Hospital, and was energetic in his medical practice in Kobe, Himeji, and Sanda. In January 1873, Berry conducted the first human dissection in the prefecture at Kobe Hospital. He visited Kobe's prison in 1877, on the prefecture's request, {{in response to an}} outbreak of beriberi within, and saw with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> the unsanitary conditions and inhumane treatment of prisoners there. He pushed the prefecture to reform its prison system, and many other missionaries followed him in visiting the prisons and presenting plans to the government for their reform.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Oedipus Rex, Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly {{fulfilling}} a prophecy that he would kill his father, Laius (the previous king), and marry his mother, Jocasta (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus, horrified at his patricide and incest, proceeds to gouge out <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> in despair.|$|E
25|$|Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses {{himself and}} fate {{before leaving the}} stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be felled by fate, and {{following}} this, a servant exits the palace to speak {{of what has happened}} inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> in despair.|$|E
25|$|Having {{obtained}} the intermediary {{degree in the}} imperial exams in 1813, Xu Jiyu was initially unsuccessful in advancing in the exam system. In 1826, Xu Jiyu was finally awarded the highest degree in the imperial examinations and four years later he was appointed to {{a position in the}} prestigious Hanlin Academy. In the academy, he worked {{under the direction of the}} chancellor, Mujangga, with whom he would work closely during following years. In 1836, he became prefect of Xunzhou in Guangxi province. During his tenure as a prefect Xu Jiyu submitted a number of official memorials on domestic reform, which impressed the Daoguang Emperor and further helped Xu to rapidly rise through the ranks of the Qing civil service. Following the outbreak of the First Opium War, Xu was appointed circuit intendant of a coastal prefecture in Fujian province, where he witnessed the war with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes,</b> an experience that convinced him that China needed to learn more about the West.|$|E

500|$|That evening Tulsidas {{noted that}} the first {{listener}} to arrive at his discourse was an old leper, who sat {{at the end of}} the gathering. After the Katha was over, Tulsidas quietly followed the leper to the woods. In the woods, at the spot where the Sankat Mochan Temple stands today, Tulsidas firmly fell at the leper's feet, shouting [...] "I know who you are" [...] and [...] "You cannot escape me". At first the leper feigned ignorance but Tulsidas did not relent. Then the leper revealed his original form of Hanuman and blessed Tulsidas. When granted a boon, Tulsidas told Hanuman he wanted to see Rama face to face. Hanuman told him to go to Chitrakuta where he would see Rama with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
500|$|Black is {{discovered}} {{at a bus}} depot by a police, his hands injured and bandaged. His pseudonym is found on a hospital bracelet; {{and he has no}} recollection of events save for the suspicion that someone died during the gap in his memory. Watts helps Black trace Dr. Miller (Željko Ivanek) to a hotel, where he informs them that Black was seeking a cure for his [...] "gift"; a seemingly-psychic ability to understand others' psyches. [...] Miller had been helping Black join a clinical trial for a drug called Proloft which would treat temporal lobe abnormalities; however, Black refutes that he would be interested in such a thing. Visiting a clinic, Black's ability reveals to him that he has been there before, during the nightmarish drug trial he cannot remember. From there, he is able to use the Millennium Group to persuade the drug company to release records which allow him to trace other participants. He finds that one participant died after gouging <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> out; the body of the supervising nurse is later found in a dumpster.|$|E
500|$|Maxentius {{organized}} his forces—still {{twice the}} size of Constantine's—in long lines facing the battle plain, with their backs to the river. Constantine's army arrived at the field bearing unfamiliar symbols on either its standards or its soldiers' shields. According to Lactantius, Constantine was visited by a dream the night before the battle, wherein he was advised [...] "to mark the heavenly sign of God on the shields of his soldiers... by means of a slanted letter X with the top of its head bent round, he marked Christ on their shields." [...] Eusebius describes another version, where, while marching at midday, [...] "he saw with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>eyes</b> in the heavens a trophy of the cross arising from the light of the sun, carrying the message, In Hoc Signo Vinces or [...] "with this sign, you shall win"; in Eusebius's account, Constantine had a dream the following night, in which Christ appeared with the same heavenly sign, and told him to make a standard, the labarum, for his army in that form. Eusebius is vague about when and where these events took place, but it enters his narrative before the war against Maxentius begins. Eusebius describes the sign as Chi (Χ) traversed by Rho (Ρ): ☧, a symbol representing the first two letters of the Greek spelling of the word Christos or Christ. In 315AD a medallion was issued at Ticinum showing Constantine wearing a helmet emblazoned with the Chi Rho, and coins issued at Siscia in 317/318AD repeat the image. The figure was otherwise rare, however, and is uncommon in imperial iconography and propaganda before the 320s.|$|E

2500|$|Believing in the perfectibility of the race, {{that there}} are no innate principles, and {{therefore}} no original propensity to evil, he considered that [...] "our virtues and our vices may be traced to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the world."

2500|$|Huxley's {{courses for}} {{students}} {{were so much}} narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: [...] "The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said [...] "Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, yet our obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices". E.W MacBride said [...] "Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist.
