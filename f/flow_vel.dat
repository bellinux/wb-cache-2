O objetivo da pesquisa foi estudar a combustÃo do BiogÃs do lÃquido da casca do coco verde, com respeito Ã eficiÃncia e emissÃes. A combustÃo Ã analisada com um modelo numÃrico, estruturado em FORTRAN e PREMIX, adaptado para processos de âCombustÃo em Meios Porososâ. Os resultados de simulaÃÃo sÃo confrontados com dados experimentais, que ressaltam vantagens operacionais em relaÃÃo Ãs caldeiras convencionais, destacando-se elevada eficiÃncia de extraÃÃo de energia e baixos nÃveis de emissÃes de CO e NOx. The current Dissertation {{treats the}} {{theoretical}} and experimental studies about a non- conventional saturated steam boiler, {{in which a}} com bustion technology is employed, the âFiltration Combustionâ, as basis for conception of its burner construction design. This combustion thermal system was studied {{by means of a}} prototype, in laboratory scale, specially developed for this research. It was prop erly instrumented {{in order to make it}} possible to monitor as well as the combustion proce ss as the energy extraction in the reaction zone. The objective of this investigation is to verify the effects of the Biogas obtained from the anaerobic digestion of the Green Coconut Skin Liquid (GCSL), on the boiler operation, concerning efficiency and polluta nt emissions, as well as the reaction stability. Biogas combustion is analyzed by numeri cal model simulations, which take in account the mass, energy (gas and solid phases) and species conservation equations. The model is structured with a flexible code in languag e FORTRAN, which includes equilibrium calculation performed through premixed combustion simulation software, the PREMIX, adapted to the combustion process and heat transfer in porous medium. The simulation allows the prediction of the temperature distribution profiles along the burner and the combustion products as function of two main operation parameters, the equivalence ratio and the air-fuel mixture <b>flow</b> <b>vel</b> ocity. Simulation results are compared with measurements in this analysis and some design aspects of the "Porous Burner Boilerâ are discussed, which evidences its operational adva ntages in comparison to the conventional boilers, especially the high energy ex traction efficiency and low carbon and nitrogen oxides emission level...|$|E
40|$|Background: The thromboembolic risk of {{atrial flutter}} (AFL) {{is not well}} defined. On the other hand, in atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), the echocardiographic demonstration of thrombus or spontaneous echo contrast in the left atria or its appendage, a lower flow velocity in the left atrial appendage, and its reduced mobility, are well known risk factors of thromboembolism. Aim: To study the incidence of these echocardiographic risk factors in patients with AFL. Material and methods: We prospectively studied 50 consecutive patients with AFL comparing them with two groups of patients with a well known increased risk of thromboembolism: 54 patients with AF and 24 patients with sinus rhythm and severe mitral stenosis (RSEMS). The group of patients with AFL was also compared with a control group of 27 patients with sinus rhythm and no increased risk of thromboembolism. In each group, we studied the presence of thrombi and spontaneous echo contrast in the left atria and left atrial appendage, emptying velocity (Vel A), filling <b>flow</b> (<b>Vel</b> B) and motility of the left atrial appendage and left atrial dimensions. Results: When compared with control patients, AFL subjects had {{a higher incidence of}} spontaneous echo contrast in the left atria and left atrial appendage (11 and 42 % respectively, p< 0. 05); slower flow velocity in the left atrial appendage (Vel A 69. 25 ± 25 and 41 ± 19 cm/s respectively, Vel B 55 ± 16 and 46 ± 20 cm/s respectively, p< 0. 05); lower atrial appendage wall motility (4 and 84 % respectively, p< 0. 001) and a larger left atrium (40 ± 10 and 45 ± 0. 6 mm respectively, p< 0. 05). Patients with AFL had a lower incidence of echocardiographic abnormalities than subjects with AF or RSEMS. Thrombi were found in 2 patients with AFL, 12 patients with AF, 4 patients with RSEMS and in no control patient. Conclusions: In AFL, there are echocardiographic markers of increased thromboembolic risk in comparison with a control group. Nevertheless, the incidence of these factors is lower than in patients with AF or with RSEMS (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 1327 - 34) ...|$|E

It flows north-east, then turns south-east, and around the village of Bolshaya Gora it accepts two right tributaries, the Votchitsa and the Tavrenga, and turns north-east. It enters Velsky District, and behind the settlement of Solginsky sharply turns north-west, until the confluence with the Podyuga.
