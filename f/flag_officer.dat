5000|$|<b>Flag</b> <b>officers</b> of the Kriegsmarine {{were the}} {{leadership}} of the German Navy (known then as the [...] "Kriegsmarine") from 1935 to 1945. Most <b>flag</b> <b>officers</b> had also served as officers of the Reichsmarine, as well as the Imperial German Navy during World War I. German naval <b>flag</b> <b>officers</b> were divided into five Admiralty ranks while a senior captain rank, known as Kommodore also existed. The Kriegsmarine <b>flag</b> <b>officers</b> were responsible for holding the senior most naval positions within the organization of the Kriegsmarine.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} September, Vikrant and her escorts reached Port Blair. En {{route to}} Visakhapatnam, {{tactical}} exercises were conducted {{in the presence of}} the <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command. From Vishakhapatnam, Vikrant set out for Madras for maintenance. Rear Admiral S. H. Sharma was appointed <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Commanding Eastern Fleet and arrived at Vishakhapatnam on 14 October. After receiving the reports that Pakistan might launch preemptive strikes, maintenance was stopped for another tactical exercise, which was completed during the night of 26–27 October at Vishakhapatnam. Vikrant then returned to Madras to resume maintenance. On 1 November, the Eastern Fleet was formally constituted, and on 13 November, all the ships set out for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. To avoid misadventures, it was planned to sail Vikrant to a remote anchorage, isolating it from combat. Simultaneously, deception signals would give the impression that Vikrant was operating somewhere between Madras and Vishakhapatnam.|$|E
5|$|In {{memory of}} Vikrant, the Vikrant Memorial was {{unveiled}} by Vice Admiral Surinder Pal Singh Cheema, <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Naval Command at K Subash Marg in the Naval Dockyard of Mumbai on 25 January 2016.

5|$|Additionally, the Portland-class cruisers were {{designed}} with space to be outfitted as fleet flagships, with {{space for a}} <b>flag</b> <b>officer</b> and his staff to operate. The class also featured an aircraft catapult amidships. They could carry four aircraft. The total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 807, a wartime complement of 952, which could increase to 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{his tour}} as captain of Vengeance, Burrell briefly resumed {{the role of}} Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954. The {{following}} month he was made an aide-de-camp to the Queen. Burrell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1955 New Year Honours. In February he became <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> of the Australian Fleet, with the acting rank of rear admiral; this was made substantive in July. On 12May 1956, he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier , marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS Sydney as flagship of the RAN. Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office, Canberra, to redevelop the service's officer structure, leading to a new General List of officers' seniority. He served as Second Naval Member (Personnel) from September 1956 until January 1958, when he again became <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> of the Australian Fleet. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1959 New Years Honours, Burrell was raised to vice admiral on 24February and became First Naval Member, the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS). He succeeded Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling.|$|E
5|$|It will {{be remembered}} that the Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, several sailors {{received}} medals {{for their}} conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first <b>flag</b> <b>officer</b> killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{unexpected}} naval success, the Confederate generals {{were still}} skeptical about their chances in the fort and held another late-night council of war, where {{they decided to}} retry their aborted escape plan. At dawn on February 15, the Confederates launched an assault led by Pillow against McClernand's division on the unprotected right flank of the Union line. The Union troops, unable {{to sleep in the}} cold weather, were not caught entirely by surprise, but Grant was. Not expecting a land assault from the Confederates, he was up before dawn and had headed off to visit <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Foote on his flagship downriver. Grant left orders that none of his generals was to initiate an engagement and no one was designated as second-in-command during his absence.|$|E
5|$|Few Australians were {{involved}} in planning the invasion.

5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts {{on the inside of}} her hull to be covered with sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
5|$|Hichens was {{recommended}} for the Victoria Cross {{for his actions}} during the night of 27/28 February. When informed by his commanding officer, Commander Kerr, of the intention to recommend him, Hichens requested that the recommendation be dropped as he now felt he had endangered two of the boats in the flotilla trying to rescue his friends. Kerr, respecting his views, dropped the recommendation, only {{for it to be}} resubmitted six weeks later after his death. The recommendation was endorsed by Commander Kerr, Admiral Lyon (the Commander-in-chief at Nore) and Rear Admiral Rogers (the <b>Flag</b> <b>officer</b> in charge at Harwich). The recommendation was rejected by the Admiralty, citing the same reasons Hichens had himself given.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, Shakti, {{as part of}} {{a battle}} group of four ships, began a {{sustained}} operational deployment to the South China Sea and the North West Pacific Ocean. The other three ships were , a Rajput-class guided missile destroyer, , a stealth frigate, and , a Kora-class corvette. This battle group was under the command of Rear Admiral P Ajit Kumar, <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Commanding, Eastern Naval Command. According to the Ministry of Defence, the two-month deployment, far from India's usual area of operations, along with naval exercises with a number of countries, aimed to demonstrate the Indian navy's operational reach.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1911, Hipper took {{command of}} the armored cruiser , along with the {{position}} {{as chief of staff}} for Rear Admiral Gustav von Bachmann, the Deputy <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer,</b> Reconnaissance Forces. In January 1912, Rear Admiral von Bachmann was promoted out of his position; on the 26th Hipper succeeded him as the deputy commander. The following day, he was promoted to Rear Admiral. After serving as the deputy commander for over a year and a half, Hipper again followed Admiral von Bachmann. Admiral von Bachmann was promoted to Chief of the Baltic Station and Hipper took over as the commanding officer of the I Scouting Group on 1 October 1913. Erich Raeder was appointed as Hipper's deputy.|$|E
5|$|On February 4 and 5, Grant landed two {{divisions}} {{just north of}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. (The troops serving under Grant were {{the nucleus of the}} Union's successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was not yet in use.) Grant's plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi Propaganda Ministry {{was quick}} to {{capitalise}} on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted as heroes, learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made {{for the first time}} to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made <b>Flag</b> <b>Officer</b> of U-Boats.|$|E
