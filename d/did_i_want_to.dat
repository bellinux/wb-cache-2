However, the [...] "much-quoted claims that she taught him the joys of oral sex is viewed with skepticism by other lovers of the King." [...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis explained to her, [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple.

2500|$|Some saw the Defence Secretary post as {{a reward}} for Portillo's {{cautious}} loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major's [...] "back me or sack me" [...] resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the [...] "darling of the right", to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: [...] "I did not want to oppose , but neither <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> close the possibility of entering a second ballot if it came to that." [...] Portillo acknowledged that [...] "ambiguity is unattractive" [...] and his opponents within the party later used Portillo's apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; [...] "I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position." ...|$|E

I wonder so much why they should have been WOMEN, and halt between two opinions in the matter. Sometimes I think it is because they were made by a man for men; sometimes, again, I think there is an abstract reason for it, and there is something more substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man. I can conceive a great mythical woman, living alone among inaccessible mountain-tops or in some lost island in the pagan seas, and ask no more. Whereas if I hear of a Hercules, I ask after Iole or Dejanira. I cannot think him a man without women. [...] But I can think of these three deep-breasted women, living out all their days on remote hilltops, seeing the white dawn and the purple even, and the world outspread before them for ever, and no more to them for ever than a sight of the eyes, a hearing of the ears, a far-away interest of the inflexible heart, not pausing, not pitying, but austere with a holy austerity, rigid with a calm and passionless rigidity; and I find them none the less women to the end.|$|E
