25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining <b>flooded</b> <b>compartment.</b> Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|E
500|$|After launching, {{the sisters}} were {{transferred}} to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{a damaged}} ship floods, flows {{of water and}} air move from one {{compartment}} to another, or {{to and from the}} outside. There are two main difficulties in simulation of such flooding. One is the effect of air, and the other is the calculation of pressure in a complex system of openings involving a large number of compartments. The air plays {{a crucial role in the}} <b>flooding</b> of some <b>compartments,</b> and the presence of air slows the rate of <b>flooding</b> in vented <b>compartments.</b> However, taking into account the effect of air results in ‘ripples’ of pressure fluctuation. Some other unusual difficulties arise, when many <b>compartments</b> are <b>flooded.</b> In this paper, new models for vented compartments and an accumulator model were proposed, which can adjust the inner pressure automatically, even for systems with many compartments and openings, especially for fully <b>flooded</b> <b>compartments.</b> The dynamic-orifice equation was investigated for use in the case of large openings, so that the ripples in the air pressure that had been caused by the square-root singularity of the existing orifice equation could be eliminated. Application to a recent real accident showed the usefulness of the proposed models...|$|R

50|$|Dragonet reached Pearl Harbor from New London 9 October 1944, {{and put out}} on {{her first}} war patrol 1 November, bound for the Kurile Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk. On the morning of 15 December 1944, while {{submerged}} south of Matsuwa, Dragonet struck an uncharted submerged pinnacle, which holed her pressure hull in the forward torpedo room. The space was completely flooded, {{and in order to}} surface the submarine, it was necessary to blow water out of the compartment with compressed air. At 0845 she surfaced, just 4 mi from the airfield on Matsuwa, and set course to clear the danger area as quickly as possible. Her bow planes were rigged out, and in order to rerig them, it would be necessary to enter the <b>flooded</b> <b>compartment.</b> Next day this was accomplished by putting pressure in the forward battery compartment, and opening the water-tight door into the forward torpedo room. The determination and skill of her crew were further tried when she had to run through two days of storm to reach Midway 20 December for emergency repairs.|$|E

The aircraft crashed through the ship's flight deck abreast of the No. 2 5 in mount, and its bomb exploded just above her hangar deck. Several aircraft stowed nearby erupted into flames and men were killed. While the crew were ordered into action to save the endangered carrier, Captain Kiefer conned his ship skilfully. First, he changed course to keep the wind from fanning the blaze. Then, he ordered magazines and other <b>compartments</b> <b>flooded</b> to prevent further explosions and to correct a 10° starboard list. Finally, he instructed the damage control party to continue <b>flooding</b> <b>compartments</b> on Ticonderogas port side which induced a 10° port list which dumped the fire overboard.

The German destroyer is unable to take evasive action and is sunk. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Trigger's death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons the submarine with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U-571 as she slips beneath the waves.

50|$|Floodability {{is reduced}} by {{dividing}} {{the volume of the}} hull into watertight compartments with decks and bulkheads (which also increase the strength of ships), use of double bottom (or double hull), and by other means. If a ship's hull is divided into watertight compartments, any flooding resulting from a breach of the hull can be contained in the compartments where the flooding occurs. In most case, the watertight compartments are fitted with a system of automatic doors, which can be triggered either remotely or locally as soon as flooding is detected (and early example of such as system was used on the RMS Titanic, which sank in spite of its watertight bulkheads). Smaller vessels and submarines generally feature watertight hatches between compartments, which are closed manually to block water from escaping the <b>flooded</b> <b>compartment.</b> As long as the flooding is localised, this can allow a ship to retain sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat, but if numerous compartments are opened to the sea, the ship can sink regardless. If a ship is fitted with longitudinal bulkheads (running fore and aft) as well as transverse bulkheads, flooding along one side of the ship can cause a serious list, which can threaten to capsize the vessel. In such cases, damage control parties can intentionally flood the corresponding compartment on the other side, equalizing the list (although this can happen in ships without longitudinal bulkheads, as well). Such techniques can work fore-and-aft as well, for example, if a flooded bow is holding the rudder and propellers out of the water.|$|E

50|$|Six torpedoes {{fired by}} Ghazi are avoided by S21 through simple depth {{changing}} manoeuvers. Ghazi by now has depleted its aft torpedoes. After Ghazi's sixth aft torpedo is fired, the critically damaged S21 dives to 350m {{so that it}} is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range. This is despite the S21 being only designed for a maximum of 250m depth. S21 also has very limited battery support for it to stay hidden from Ghazi. Captain Razak also decides to play the waiting game, although he is not aware of S21's dire situation. With time running out, Arjun decides to instigate Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees so that it can use it's bow torpedoes. Unknown to Razak, with this manoeuver Ghazi is now inside S21's extremely restricted aft torpedoes firing path. However, S21's aft torpedoes by now only can be launched manually due to Compartment 1 being totally flooded. Arjun, decides to dive into Compartment 1 to manually trigger the torpedoes, knowing that he might drown in the process. Arjun dives into Compartment 1 and successfully triggers an aft torpedo. Ghazi also launches its bow torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by S21 aft torpedo and disintegrates in water, thus ending the stand-off. Arjun is later saved alive from the <b>flooded</b> <b>Compartment</b> 1. The movie ends with XO Devraj waving the national flag on a surfaced S21, signalling an Indian Navy Vessel. The epilogue indicates that the day after the Ghazi incident, Pakistani fighters bomb Indian airfields, marking the beginning of the 1971 Indo-Pak war for liberation of Bangladesh.|$|E
5000|$|The A-3 Aerosledge has a hull {{built of}} riveted metal alloy {{construction}} using 2mm D-16T plates and profiles. The craft's ribs, stringers and plates are also of D-16 Duraluminium. Traverse bulkheads divide the craft into three watertight compartments. The craft will remain afloat with one <b>flooded</b> <b>compartment.</b> Double plating is employed for the hull bottom to strengthen it for crossing ice and snow. Low friction 3.5 mm polyethylene {{is attached to}} the bottom plates, which is removable for repair. Three stainless-steel runners are mounted to the hull base to provide the craft with the ability to maintain an even course, and prevent sideslipping on ice. The smooth lines of the hull's underside allow it to traverse bodies of water choked with weeds without difficulty. [...] Even with a maximum payload, the Aerosledge has a draft of no more than 2 inches. [...] The cabin is fully enclosed with a seating capacity of five in passenger configuration. In standard mail-carrying configuration, the cabin has one swiveling seat for the driver/mail carrier, and a cargo capacity of 1,433 lbs over ice, and 661 lbs over water. [...] Cabin access is by two gull-wing doors. There is an additional baggage storage compartment in front of the cabin, located beneath a hermetically-sealed hatch. The craft is controlled by a single wheel connected to twin rudders located behind the propeller. If the wheel is pulled towards the driver both rudders fold outward, forming a brake. If turned and pulled toward the driver, only one rudder folds outward, giving greater turning control over water overgrown with reeds or weeds. Three stainless steel runners mounted along the bottom of the hull provide additional stability while traveling over ice or snow. [...] When traversing snow, the slightly upturned bow of the A-3, together with the differences in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces of the hull, generate an aerodynamic lifting force. At speeds above 50 mph aerodynamic lift reduces the pressure exerted by the craft against the surface by one third. As the depth of the furrow decreases, friction resistance is reduced accordingly. On water the large area of the lower hull, with its small keel, makes it an ideal shallow-draft watercraft.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{existing}} criteria of stability for ships both intact and with damage are reviewed from {{a critical point}} of view.

50|$|From {{the time}} of the {{collision}} to the moment of her sinking, at least 35000 LT of water flooded into Titanic, causing her displacement to nearly double from 48300 LT to over 83000 LT. The flooding did not proceed at a constant pace, nor was it distributed evenly throughout the ship, due to the configuration of the <b>flooded</b> <b>compartments.</b> Her initial list to starboard was caused by asymmetrical flooding of the starboard side as water poured down a passageway {{at the bottom of the}} ship.

50|$|The {{significance}} of this effect {{is proportional to the}} cube of the width of the tank or compartment, so two baffles separating the area into thirds will reduce the displacement of the center of gravity of the fluid by a factor of 9.

Another worrying feature of free surface effect is that a positive feedback loop can be established, in which the period of the roll is equal or almost equal to the period of the motion of the centre of gravity in the fluid, resulting in each roll increasing in magnitude until the loop is broken or the ship capsizes.|$|R
