5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and in conclusion to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

500|$|Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism (original Spanish title: Facundo: Civilización i Barbarie) is a {{book written}} in 1845 by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, a writer and {{journalist}} who became the seventh president of Argentina. It is a cornerstone of Latin American literature: a work of creative non-fiction that helped to define the parameters <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the region's development, modernization, power, and culture. Subtitled Civilization and Barbarism, Facundo contrasts civilization and barbarism as seen in early 19th-century Argentina. [...] Literary critic Roberto González Echevarría calls the work [...] "the most important book written by a Latin American in any discipline or genre".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{argues that}} Val Plumwood is {{incorrect}} {{to declare the}} resituation of animals into ethical terms as supererogatory {{as opposed to the}} necessary resituation of humans into ecological terms, as the two tasks are linked. Smith rejects the culture/nature dichotomy, and suggests that a politics of recognition is an appropriate way to think about relationships. She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> ecological and animal injustices.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots {{may be more likely to}} believe not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E

40|$|Title: Critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation: a {{framework}} for guiding pedagogy in occupational therapy Type of session: Theoretical paper Keywords: critical thinking, occupation, theory development Intent: This theoretical paper presents our initial proposed framework <b>for</b> critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation. Literature review and a practical scenario are used to illustrate critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation as different from professional reasoning (Facione 2 ̆ 6 Facione, 1996; Schell 2 ̆ 6 Cervero, 1993). Models and frameworks of critical thinking from other disciplines are examined in relationship to occupation (Moseley et al., 2005). Argument: Critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation is a foundation {{that needs to be}} explicitly taught in the occupational therapy curriculum [...] before and while teaching professional reasoning. Critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation is different from the application of professional reasoning in practice, as critical thinking requires deep understanding of the underlying structure of the discipline. Although there has been renewed focus on deep learning about occupation (Hooper et al., 2014), currently there is no existing framework <b>for</b> teaching critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation. We present an initial framework with elements of information gathering, building understanding, and productive thinking interacting with strategic and reflective <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation. Importance to occupational science: Occupational science is the conceptual and empirical basis for the practice of occupational therapy, and informs pedagogical approaches to teaching the epistemology of the discipline of occupational therapy. A recognized framework <b>for</b> teaching critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation may increase awareness of the need to include occupational science in the occupational therapy curriculum. Conclusion: This is an invitation for dialog that will inform development of {{a framework}} <b>for</b> teaching critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation. We argue that critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation is distinct from professional reasoning in occupational therapy, and that occupational science directly informs this critical thinking. Questions to facilitate discussion: Taking a look at the elements and processes in our framework- how do you see these holding true as you teach critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation? What elements are supported? What elements are missing? What examples do you have of pedagogical methods that explicitly promote critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation? What opportunities exist for the measurement of growth in critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation in learners across a curriculum? What are some examples of how occupational science research could be integrated into occupational therapy curricula as a method <b>for</b> teaching critical <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> occupation...|$|R

2500|$|Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land is a 2004 {{documentary}} by Sut Jhally and Bathsheba Ratzkoff. The movie {{claims that}} the influence of pro-Israel media watchdog groups, such as CAMERA and Honest Reporting, leads to distorted and pro-Israel media reports. In its response to the movie, the pro-Israel JCRC criticizes the film for not discussing the influence of [...] "the numerous pro‐Palestinian media watchdog groups, including, ironically, FAIR (Fair and Accuracy in the Media, which describes itself as 'A National Media Watch Group'), whose spokesperson played {{a prominent role in}} the film". According to the pro-Palestinian LiP Magazine, the movie [...] "offers a great starting point <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> media misrepresentation of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and useful analysis of how language is used to manipulate public opinion," [...] but is short on [...] "solid statistics and facts to back up some of its blanket statements". A review in The New York Times by Ned Martel found that the film [...] "largely ignores Palestinian leadership, which has surely played a part in the conflict’s broken vows and broken hearts. And such a lack of dispassion weakens the one-sided film's bold and detailed argument".|$|E
2500|$|Sylvia Cremer (then at the University of Regensburg) {{gave the}} first {{definition}} of social immunity in her seminal 2007 Current Biology paper 'Social Immunity', {{saying that the}} [...] "collective action or altruistic behaviours of infected individuals that benefit the colony" [...] before laying out a conceptual framework <b>for</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the topic using examples from primates and eusocial insects. Cremer's definition focused on the collective benefits of behaviours and was adopted by other behavioural ecologists (e.g. Wilson-Rich 2009) when describing immune phenomena which were contingent on the action of multiple individuals. Cremer went on to develop a series of comparisons between personal and social immune systems—she explained that her definition of social immunity encompassed [...] "the nature of these defences that they cannot be performed efficiently by single individuals, but depend strictly on the cooperation {{of at least two}} individuals". However, in 2010, Sheena Cotter and Rebecca Kilner (both then at the University of Cambridge) proposed to widen the definition of social immunity to [...] "any type of immune response that has been selected to increase the fitness of the challenged individual and one or more recipients", and recommended that the phenomena described by Cremer be known as collective immunity. This definition places importance on the evolutionary origin of behaviours rather than on their functional role at present; Cotter and Kilner explained that their broader definition would include immune behaviours in both animal families and social microbes as well as situations where herd immunity exists due to investment in personal immunity, arguing that this allowed for investigations of the evolution of social immunity to have a [...] "greater depth than would otherwise be possible". They further suggested that the evolution of social immunity be seen as one of the major transitions in evolution. Joël Meunier (University of Mainz) proposed a further redefinition in his 2015 paper on the role of social immunity in the evolution of group living, suggesting that Cotter and Kilner's definition could problematically encompass immune defences which arise not due to social life but due to shared location; Meunier defines a social immune system as [...] "any collective and personal mechanism that has emerged and/or is maintained at least partly due to the anti-parasite defence it provides to other group members".|$|E
