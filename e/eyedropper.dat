Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an <b>eyedropper,</b> or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{selecting}} colors, including palettes, color choosers and using an <b>eyedropper</b> tool to select a colour on the canvas. The built-in color choosers include RGB/HSV selector or scales, water-color selector, CMYK selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed colour and RGB color spaces; other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black-and-white image. CMYK, LAB and HSV (hue, saturation, value) are supported this way. Color blending can be achieved using the Blend tool, by applying a gradient {{to the surface of}} an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP; a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided. Gradient plug-ins are also available.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePreservative free {{ophthalmic}} formulations {{need to be}} packaged {{either as}} single doses, or using specially designed sterility preserving multidose <b>eyedroppers.</b> Our objective was to evaluate potential sorption phenomena between a device with a silicone sterility preserving membrane and the delivered drops of several ophthalmic solutions. Cyclosporine, rifamycin, latanoprost, timolol and norfloxacin were used as model drugs. Quantification of the active substance in delivered drops (1 to 4 drops per day) from low density polyethylene (LDPE) bottles without any sterility preserving device and from LDPE bottles with a sterility preserving silicone membrane (LDPE-Si) was performed for 14 days (n≥ 3), using validated HPLC methods. For cyclosporine, mean concentrations did not vary by more than 10  % from reference concentrations for either LDPE or LDPE-Si <b>eyedroppers,</b> but for LDPE-Si, the concentrations of the 1  mg. ml- 1 cyclosporine micellar solution {{were found to be}} significantly lower than for those from LDPE <b>eyedroppers</b> (p= 0. 0127). For LDPE-Si, rifamycin mean concentrations decreased by 11. 2  % throughout the 14 day study period, but didn’t vary by more than 10  % for LDPE and glass <b>eyedroppers.</b> However, rifamycin concentrations from LDPE-Si were not significantly different from those from LDPE <b>eyedroppers.</b> For latanoprost, whilst mean concentrations did not vary by more than 10  % from reference concentration for LDPE <b>eyedroppers,</b> for LDPE-Si <b>eyedroppers</b> concentrations decreased by 76. 4  % at their lowest concentration and never returned to their initial level. For timolol and norfloxacin, mean concentrations did not vary by more than 10  % for either LDPE or LDPE-Si <b>eyedroppers</b> and no significant difference was found between the 2 <b>eyedroppers</b> concentrations. Our results are in favor of an absence of significant sorption between LDPE-Si <b>eyedroppers</b> for timolol or norfloxacin ophthalmic solutions. Further studies should be performed on cyclosporine ophthalmic micellar solutions and rifamycin ophthalmic solutions before any definite conclusions can be made. Finally, our results show that latanoprost ophthalmic solutions shouldn’t be used with LDPE-Si <b>eyedroppers</b> as the loss of active substance would cause a sever under-dosing...|$|R
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} topically administered phenylephrine 10 % {{are well known}} and can be minimised by reducing the concentration of drops administered. By modifying {{the dimensions of the}} dropper tip we reduced the volume of the drops administered, and therefore the total dose of phenylephrine, without altering the concentration. No difference in the mydriasis produced by drops of small and normal volume could be detected. Since a smaller dose of phenylephrine is administered with smaller drops, the risk of systemic side effects could be reduced by modifying the tips of <b>eyedroppers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeAcanthamoeba {{keratitis}} {{is difficult}} to treat because Acanthamoeba cysts are resistant {{to the majority of}} antimicrobial agents. Despite the efficacy of 0. 02 % chlorhexidine in treating Acanthamoeba keratitis, a lack of data in the literature regarding the formulation's stability limits its clinical use. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop an optimal extemporaneous 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate ophthalmic formulation for patients in need. MethodsWith available active pharmaceutical ingredients, 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate sample solutions were prepared by diluting with BSS Plus Solution or acetate buffer. Influences of the buffer, type of container, and temperature under daily-open condition were assessed based on the changes of pH values and chlorhexidine concentrations of the test samples weekly. To determine the beyond-use date, the optimal samples were stored at 2 – 8 °C or room temperature, and analyzed at time 0 and at Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24. ResultsDespite chlorhexidine exhibiting better stability in acetate buffer than in BSS solution, its shelf-life was <  14 days when stored in a light-resistant low-density polyethylene container. The acetate-buffered 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate solution stored in light-resistant high-density polyethylene <b>eyedroppers</b> did not exhibit significant changes in pH or strength at any time interval. ConclusionThe acetate-buffered 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate ophthalmic solution stored in light-resistant high-density polyethylene <b>eyedroppers</b> demonstrated excellent stability at 2 – 25 °C for 6 months after being sealed and for 1 month after opening. This finding will enable us to prepare 0. 02 % chlorhexidine digluconate ophthalmic solutions based on a doctor's prescription...|$|R

5000|$|The {{reservoirs}} of {{the earliest}} fountain pens were mostly filled by <b>eyedropper.</b> This was a cumbersome and potentially messy process, {{which led to the}} commercial development of alternative methods that quickly dominated the industry. However, newer, more convenient filling mechanisms have never entirely displaced [...] "eyedropper-filling" [...] pens in the marketplace, and they remain widely manufactured today. For some the simplicity of the mechanism, coupled with the large volume of ink it can encapsulate, compensates for the inconvenience of ink transfer.|$|E
50|$|Fountain pens carry ink {{within the}} barrel, {{traditionally}} either inserted {{at one end}} in bulk with a syringe or <b>eyedropper</b> pipette, or through a mechanical filling system built into the pen (such as a piston or vacuum-pump mechanism). For such fountain pens, ink is available in bottles which will typically refill an individual pen many tens of times. Simpler fountain pens use pre-filled ink cartridges, although {{in many cases the}} cartridge can be replaced with a converter which replicates the mechanical filling action of more expensive pens. The cost per millilitre of ink tends to be lower for bottled ink than for cartridges.|$|E
50|$|Hess had {{established}} the first American premature nursery at the Sarah Morris Children's Hospital within Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital in 1922. In 1924, he hired Lundeen {{to head the}} nursery. Hess and Lundeen focused on three goals {{in the care of}} preterm infants: maintaining body temperature, avoiding infection and providing nutrition. The pair advocated for breast milk as the optimal nutrition source for the preterm baby. In their attempts to prevent infection, staff in premature nurseries of the time wore gowns, masks and caps, and they even excluded parents from visitation. Feedings were given by <b>eyedropper.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen is a nib pen that, unlike its predecessor, the dip pen, contains an internal reservoir of liquid ink. The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via {{a combination of}} gravity and capillary action. Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually, via {{the use of a}} Pasteur pipette (<b>eyedropper)</b> or syringe, or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction (for example, through a piston mechanism) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens employ removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Pearson {{was born}} in Baltimore Maryland, the {{daughter}} of two incarcerated drug addicts, and was raised in an East Baltimore foster home. Born a premature crack baby and weighing only three pounds, she was not expected to live. [...] She was so small that she was fed with an <b>eyedropper</b> until she could be fed normally. According to her memoir, Grace After Midnight, she met her biological parents very few times; {{her mother was a}} crack addict and her father was an armed robber. She thus decided to go by her foster family's surname. She was a tomboy from a young age.|$|E
50|$|Though his {{composition}} output was small, Le Caine {{is remembered}} {{as one of}} the great pioneer composers of musique concrète, his best known work being Dripsody (1955), a piece of musique concrète based on the sound of a single drop of water that over the course of the piece is permuted and contorted into a variety of sounds. Le Caine used a metal wastebasket filled with two inches of water, held an <b>eyedropper</b> ten inches above the wastebasket, and tape-recorded the water drops for thirty minutes. After reviewing the resulting recording, Le Caine selected one of the water drops and spliced it onto a short tape loop. This allowed the water drop to repeat like a traditional ostinato figure.|$|E
5000|$|Fountain pens were {{developed}} in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an ink reservoir chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, {{in order to protect}} its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by <b>eyedropper,</b> suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with [...] "converters", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, the {{principle}} is used to make small toys often called [...] "water dancers" [...] or [...] "water devils". The principle is the same, but the <b>eyedropper</b> is instead replaced with a decorative object with the same properties which is a tube of near-neutral buoyancy, for example, a blown-glass bubble. If {{the tail of the}} glass bubble is given a twist, the flow of the water {{into and out of the}} glass bubble creates spin. This causes the toy to spin as it sinks and rises. An example of such a toy is the red [...] "devil" [...] shown here. The device also has a practical use for measuring the pressure of a liquid.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen uses water-based liquid ink delivered through a nib. The ink flows from a reservoir through a [...] "feed" [...] to the nib, then through the nib, due to capillary action and gravity. The nib has no moving parts and delivers ink through a thin slit {{to the writing}} surface. A {{fountain pen}} reservoir can be refillable or disposable; the disposable type is called an ink cartridge. A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism, such as a piston, to draw ink from a bottle through the nib, or it may require refilling with an <b>eyedropper.</b> Refill reservoirs, also known as cartridge converters, are available for some pens which use disposable cartridges. A fountain pen {{can be used with}} permanent or non-permanent inks.|$|E

This is a simple scaling of the red, green, and blue channels, and is why color balance tools in Photoshop and the GIMP have a white <b>eyedropper</b> tool. It has been demonstrated that performing the white balancing in the phosphor set assumed by sRGB tends to produce large errors in chromatic colors, even though it can render the neutral surfaces perfectly neutral.|$|E
5000|$|In Buy mode, {{the player}} may {{purchase}} {{items from the}} catalog, sell objects {{that are on the}} current lot, and arrange objects on the current lot. Construction-related elements such as doors, windows, fences, and stairs are not associated with buy mode, but are in build mode. Buy mode largely focuses on furniture and appliances. The descriptions of many of the objects available for purchase in the game (namely the least expensive ones) involve humor, sarcasm, insults towards the player, and wit, and serves as comic relief in the game. For example, one of the cheapest cars available in The Sims 3, the [...] "Big Lemon", notes that although the car's doors are jammed and its ignition is faulty, it is still worth buying. Another example is the outdoor entertainment item [...] "Foot-and-Hand Ball" [...] used to train the athletic skill, which references and pokes fun at American football, which, despite its name, rarely involves contact with the ball via the feet. A feature that was introduced in The Sims 2 and stays present currently is the <b>eyedropper</b> tool. When the <b>eyedropper</b> tool is pointed at a wall covering, floor covering, or most objects, will show the name of what it's pointed at. Clicking on a wall or floor covering will switch to the appropriate area of build mode and select that covering so it can be applied. Clicking on an object will make an exact duplicate of it, and will focus the catalog on that object. The family inventory is a space where objects that are too large to be held in a Sim's personal inventory are kept. Certain opportunities may make an object available in the Family Inventory. When a Sim family moves, if [...] "pack furniture" [...] is selected, all objects in the household will be placed in the Family inventory, to be moved and rearranged in the new house.|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{fountain}} pens were almost all filled by unscrewing {{a portion of}} the hollow barrel or holder and inserting the ink by means of an <b>eyedropper</b> - a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling. Now that the materials' problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. In 1890, W. B. Purvis became the first African-American to patent a self-filler. Self-fillers began to arrive {{around the turn of the}} century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman's twist-filler. The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer's lever-filler, introduced in 1912, paralleled by Parker's roughly contemporary button-filler.|$|E

5000|$|A dip pen or nib pen usually {{consists}} of a metal nib with capillary channels like those of fountain-pen nibs, mounted in a handle or holder, often made of wood. Other materials {{can be used for}} the holder, including bone, metal, and plastic; some pens are made entirely of glass. Generally, dip pens have no ink reservoir, so the user must recharge the ink from an ink bowl or bottle to continue drawing or writing. There are simple, tiny tubular reservoirs that illustrators sometimes clip onto dip pens, which allow drawing for several minutes without recharging the nib. Recharging can be done by dipping into an inkwell; but some illustrators and cartoonists, who are the main users of such pens, are likelier to charge the pen with an <b>eyedropper,</b> a syringe, or a brush, which gives more control over the amount of ink applied. Thus, [...] "dip pens" [...] are not necessarily dipped; many illustrators call them [...] "nib pens".|$|E

Cyclosporine A formulations at high concentrations are difficult to manufacture because of cyclosporine's lipophilicity, and generally require an oil based vector. In this study, we investigated the physicochemical and microbiological stability of two high concentrations (10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL) of an ophthalmic cyclosporine A micellar solution in a low density polyethylene multidose <b>eyedropper,</b> at two conservation conditions (5 °C and 25 °C), before and with simulated use. Analyses used were the following: visual inspection, cyclosporine quantification by a stability-indicating liquid chromatography method, osmolality and pH measurements and turbidity. A complementary analysis by dynamic light scattering was implemented to evaluate potential particle formation or micelle size change. In the in-use study, cyclosporine quantification was also performed on the drops emitted from the multidose eyedroppers. Our {{results show that the}} cyclosporine micellar formulation retains good physicochemical and microbiological stability, as all parameters stayed within acceptable range limits, however a higher variability in cyclosporine concentrations was observed for 20 mg/mL units stored at 25 °C. The in-use study showed that cyclosporine concentrations in the emitted drops were also within acceptable range limits. The micellar formulation presented in this study can therefore be stored at 5 °C or at ≤ 25 °C for up to 6 months...|$|E
40|$|Something {{to paint}} <b>Eyedropper</b> or {{medicine}} syringe GOUACHE is a heavy, opaque watercolor paint, {{sometimes referred to}} as body color. When applied correctly its finish can be almost velvety in appearance. It is commonly found in tube form today, however dried or tablet forms are still available. Gouache is easily reconstituted once it dries out, and truly a little goes a long way. There are many different makers or brands of gouache paint and you will have to try them out yourself to see what you prefer. Every artist’s personal taste is unique and what may be the perfect brand for one may not be for another. In today’s class we will be using Reeves student quality gouache. Not necessarily because I like it, but rather it is very inexpensive. My personal preference when it comes to gouache is Windsor and Newton Designer gouache. There is a big difference between student quality and artists quality gouache. The main difference is how much pigment is actually in the paint itself. Obviously the more pigment that is ground in the more opaque and even the final appearance will be. It is easier with artist’s quality to lay a “flat ” background, and uses much less medium as there is more pigment. It can be done with the student gouache, and if you can master the technique with inferior paint, imagine how great you’ll be with the good stuff. Period painting was not done in a “flat ” manner, and had beautiful shadings and highlights. Some of this was done with watering down the paint to almost translucent and some was done with the layering of paint colors. We will be learning and practicing the latter today...|$|E
