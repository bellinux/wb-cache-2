40|$|Comparisons of {{duration}} of response (DoR) and {{duration of}} clinical benefit (DoCB) within clinical trials are prone to biases. To address these biases, we used new methodology to prospectively analyze <b>expected</b> DoR and <b>expected</b> DoCB. Objective response rate and clinical benefit rate were calculated for fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg, and used to calculate <b>expected</b> DoR and <b>expected</b> DoCB for each dose group. The ratios for <b>expected</b> DoR and <b>expected</b> DoCB (<b>expected</b> DoR 500 /expected DoR 250 and <b>expected</b> DoCB 500 /expected DoCB 250) were then calculated, thereby allowing statistical comparisons of these endpoints between each arm of the COmparisoN of Faslodex In Recurrent or Metastatic breast cancer (CONFIRM) trial. <b>Expected</b> DoRs for fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg were 3. 2 and 3. 6 months, respectively. The <b>expected</b> DoR ratio between fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg {{was not statistically significant}} (0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 48 - 1. 67, P = 0. 724). The <b>expected</b> DoCBs for fulvestrant 500 and 250 mg were 9. 8 and 7. 2 months, respectively. The <b>expected</b> DoCB ratio showed that the <b>expected</b> DoCB for fulvestrant 500 mg was significantly improved compared with the <b>expected</b> DoCB for fulvestrant 250 mg (1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 73, P = 0. 013).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>expected</b> inflation on stock prices and <b>expected</b> long-run returns. An ex ante estimates measure of <b>expected</b> long-run returns is derived by incorporating estimates of <b>expected</b> of future corporate cash flows into {{a variant of the}} Campbell-Shiller dividend-price ratio model. In this model, the log earnings-price ratio is expressed as a linear function of <b>expected</b> future returns, <b>expected</b> earnings growth rates, and the log of the current dividend-payout ratio. Expectations of earnings growth are inferred from equity analysts' earnings forecasts, while inflation expectations are drawn from surveys of professional forecasters. I find that the negative relation between equity valuations and <b>expected</b> inflation results from two effects: higher <b>expected</b> inflation coincides with (I) lower <b>expected</b> real earnings growth and (ii) higher required real returns. The earnings channel is not merely a reflection of inflation's recession-signalling properties; rather, much of the negative valuation effect results from a negative relation between <b>expected</b> inflation and <b>expected</b> longer-term real earnings growth. The effect of <b>expected</b> inflation on required (long-run) real stock returns is also substantial. A one percentage point increase in <b>expected</b> inflation raises required real stock returns about one percentage point, which on average implies a 20 percent decline in the level of stock prices. The inflation-related component of <b>expected</b> real stock returns is closely related to the component explained by real long-term bond yields. Stock - Prices; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|R
