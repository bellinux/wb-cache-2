40|$|Given {{the choice}} of waiting for an adverse outcome or <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> quickly, many people choose the latter. Theoretical models of {{decision-making}} have assumed that this occurs {{because there is a}} cost to waiting—i. e., dread. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the neural responses to waiting for a cutaneous electric shock. Some individuals dreaded the outcome so much that, when given a choice, they preferred to receive more voltage rather than wait. Even when no decision was required, these extreme dreaders were distinguishable from those who dreaded mildly by the rate of increase of neural activity in the posterior elements of the cortical pain matrix. This suggests that dread derives, in part, from the attention devoted to the expected physical response and not simply from fear or anxiety. Although these differences were observed during a passive waiting procedure, they correlated with individual behavior in a subsequent choice paradigm, providing evidence for a neurobiological link between the experienced disutility of dread and subsequent decisions about unpleasant outcomes. Making decisions about gains and losses is one of the archetypal problems that all animals face, but whe...|$|R

In addition, 111 police officers were injured in the conflict, including one who was knifed in the chest. Reagan then called out 2,200 state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for two weeks {{to crack down on the}} protesters. The Guard remained in Berkeley for 17 days, camping in People's Park, and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordoned-off fencing and placed all development plans for People's Park on hold.

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E

Their very essence goes against much of what recent pedagogy says about teaching research and writing. By setting the bar too low with a five-paragraph essay as the benchmark for success, teachers fail to sufficiently challenge their students. Multigenre {{writing is a way}} to learn the necessary research skills developed in traditional methods and demonstrate a deeper understanding of multiple genres. By allowing the students to present their findings through both traditional and alternative forms of expression, multigenre essays challenge students to keep up instead of punishing them with monotonous methods. Students have a choice in what to research instead of being spoon-fed a dry topic. The motivation to work and the desire to finish comes from a passion for the subject that goes way beyond the traditional avenue of just <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> In the secondary classroom we teach individuals and there must be multiple ways for writers to develop their skills. By giving students freedom in topic choice and assessment scales, we increase their investment in education. We should work with our class to shape the curriculum instead of imposing it upon the students. A multigenre unit opens itself up to this kind of teaching through its focus on the individual learner. During conferences, teachers meet one on one with students to address their needs, develop their writing, and guide the research. The workshop environment, one of sharing and support, will take students to the next level in their education, beyond the heights of a traditional essay. Teachers should embrace this research format for the betterment of their practice and their students' futures.

[...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] He wants to give me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Sunday 2030 My Darling, Just {{got back}} from Eglin Field. It was quite {{interesting}} they’ve got alot [sic] of stuff over there. We had a mail call while we were there, an AT- 7 flew down from Craig with a load. I’m sending you a letter we got from your mother. Tell her hello for me, and send her my love, she’s very sweet. I also {{got a letter from}} you written Thursday night. It didn’t sound like you honey, it was very disgusted and very bitter and I’m sorry. But darling it can’t be helped. The Army is running our lives and there’s {{nothing we can do about}} it. Keep that beautiful chin of yours up baby, don’t let <b>it</b> <b>get</b> you down, <b>it’s</b> much harder that way. Darling I’m making this promise to you that every minute, every second that we can be together we will be. We can’t afford to spend a second of our time thinking about the past of the future. What’s important is that we will have that time and we’ve got to pack into it a lifetime of laughs, of wonderful moments, and maybe a few sorrows. And if you think I’m going to live on the post you’re nuts, and if the Army thins so its nuts too. You bet I’m going to live with you darling, the Army or anyone isn’t strong enough to stop me. Honey we really have no right to complain, we’re really very lucky, there are many other couples who haven’t had the happiness that we are going to, and will never be able to. Darling we should thank God that we will have all those wonderful months together. We have had some tough weeks but we can’t be bitter about it. If we let that happen we’ll start blaming each other, and that’s the quickest way of breaking up a marriage. I can’t help what the Army does with me darling, from the job they’re doing over there I guess they know what they’re doing. All fighter pilots have to go through this and I’m glad to be <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> <b>It</b> would be even tougher later wouldn’t it darling? So keep smilin’ baby, and I’ll see you Saturday. Yes, Saturday, I was going to surprise you but I guess you need some cheering up (conceited ain’t I?). If you feel a tenth as bad as I do darling, you sure must. It’s so damned lonesome around here anyway and being separated from you makes it so God damned much worse. Please darling tell me that you’re happy, because when you aren’t, I’m not. Remember honey, the most important thing in the world to me is you. I love you darling, I feel I should make some attempt to tell you how much, but I can’t. It’s as hard to grasp and as large as the infinity of the universe angel, and even Einstein can’t explain that, so how could I ever begin to. All I can tell you is I love you, I love you, again and again, and if I kept on from now ‘til doom’s day, and every “I love you” was materially a part of my love for you, I’d not have enough time darling. The time will pass honey. It will be the longest week of my life, but believe it or not science has proved that time waits for no one. I guess we’ve come the closest to disproving it though. Just think of the time we’ll have together, - it helps. And I will be able to live off the Post darling. It’s not exactly legal but what the Army doesn’t know won’t hurt it. I love you angel, I love you with all my heart. You have all my love all my life, my darling wife, and until Saturday honey, I remain, as always, Your devoted husband Judd P. S. – It’s the moments apart that make the moments together so much more enjoyable. [Translation ends...|$|R
