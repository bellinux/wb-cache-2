Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).|$|E

Prediction of an individual cardiovascular disease risk in young women is difficult. It is known that women with hypertensive pregnancy complications have an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease in later life and pregnancy might {{be used as a}} cardiovascular stress test to identify women who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. In this study we assess the possibility of long term cardiovascular risk prediction in women with a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders at term. In a longitudinal follow-up study, between June 2008 and November 2010, 300 women with a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders at term (HTP cohort) and 94 women with a history of normotensive pregnancies at term (NTP cohort) were included. From the cardiovascular risk status that was known two years after index pregnancy we calculated individual (extrapolated) 10 -and 30 -year cardiovascular <b>event</b> <b>risks</b> using four different risk prediction models including the Framingham risk score, the SCORE score and the Reynolds risk score. Continuous data were analyzed using the Student's T test and Mann-Whitney U test and categorical data by the Chi-squared test. A poisson regression analysis was performed to calculate the incidence risk ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals for the different cardiovascular risk estimation categories. After a mean follow-up of 2. 5 years, HTP women had significantly higher mean (SD) extrapolated 10 -year cardiovascular <b>event</b> <b>risks</b> (HTP 7. 2 % (3. 7); NTP 4. 4 % (1. 9) (p <. 001, IRR 5. 8, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 19)) and 30 -year cardiovascular <b>event</b> <b>risks</b> (HTP 11 % (7. 6); NTP 7. 3 % (3. 5) (p <. 001, IRR 2. 7, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 4. 5)) as compared to NTP women calculated by the Framingham risk scores.
