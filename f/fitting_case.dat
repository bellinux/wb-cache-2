Compression experiments have revealed the known three stages of the constitutive response, namely the initial increasing and softening branches at moderate strains, the plateau region at large strains and the hardening part at very large strains under compaction. Tension tests have quantified the increasing and softening branches of the stress-strain curve up to fracture. Subsequently, a constitutive mechanical model, for the simulation of the experimental findings up to very large strains (75 % engineering strain under compression), is proposed.

Our conclusion is that by taking 50 fb^- 1 total effective integrated luminosity data, the statistical uncertainty of the top potential subtracted mass can be suppressed to about 7 MeV and the total uncertainty is about 30 MeV.

40|$|Economic {{partnerships}} between {{developed and developing}} countries such as bilateral agreements are often seen as a platform for the attainment of economic growth, improvement of living standards, creation of employment opportunities {{as well as the}} reduction of poverty. However there have been some critiques centred around the vulnerabilities involved in developing countries committing themselves to bilateral agreements, as such commitments can cause them to fall short of realising their own developmental aspirations.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Radical, far-beyond-the-norm {{innovation}} engages unknown developmental frontiers {{outside the}} familiar fields of standardised practice, requiring new and broad perspectives. This implies significant uncertainty during problem solution – the more radical, {{the greater the}} uncertainty. No systematic procedures for managing radical innovation exist. Research managers agree that traditional, standardised innovation approaches do not provide sufficient support for managers {{to cope with the}} degree of functional uncertainty typical of radical innovations. An efficient approach for delimiting and describing its uncertainties and managing the development process during the radical innovation process is sought. This thesis synthesizes a methodology for radical innovation from Systems Engineering and Management of Technology theory. Its application in a case study illustrates how it facilitates efficient strategic decision-making during radical innovation. Systems Engineering, by its comprehensive perspective, provides a valuable non-intuitive framework from which required radical innovation functionalities and uncertainties are identified, delimited, characterised and developed. Management of Technology concerns the core theory of technology; its perspective on technology provides the radical innovation process with a means of characterising and delimiting status, potential and uncertainty of functional, technological elements in the system. The resulting Radical Innovation Methodology is verified through application to an emerging renewable energy concept, the Solar Chimney Power Plant, which responds to a demand for innovation aimed at sustainable energy generation. The radically tall chimney structure required by the plant, proposed to stand 1, 500 meter tall, serves as a <b>fitting</b> <b>case</b> for illustrating the methodology.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a wind on the {{emerging}} spectrum from an inefficiently-radiating accretion flow in a global magnetic field are examined, based on the analytic solution obtained recently {{by one of the}} present authors. The results exhibit the steepening of the negative slope appearing in the intermediate frequency range of bremsstrahlung spectrum and the decrease in the luminosity ratio of thermal synchrotron to bremsstrahlung, in accordance with the increasing wind strength. Both effects are due to a suppressed mass accretion rate in the inner disk, caused by a mass loss in terms of wind. In order to demonstrate the reliability of this model, Sagittarius A ∗ (Sgr A ∗) and the nucleus of M 31, both of which have been resolved in an X-ray band by Chandra, are taken up as the best candidates for the broadband spectral fittings. Although the observed X-ray data are reproduced for these objects by both of the inverse-Compton and the bremsstrahlung fittings, some evidence of preference for the latter are recognized. The wind effects are clearly seen in the latter <b>fitting</b> <b>case,</b> in which we can conclude that a widely extending accretion disk is present in each nucleus, with no or only weak wind in Sgr A ∗ and with a considerably strong wind in the nuclear region of M 31.

This fact strongly suggests that the accretion in this object does not proceed like Bondi’s prediction, though its extent almost reaches the Bondi radius...|$|E
40|$|Like {{many other}} {{countries}} worldwide, South Africa has come under public pressure to introduce mandatory GM labelling. Although there is an increased understanding about {{the social and political}} implications of GM labelling in developed countries, there is still a research gap with regard to implications for developing countries. South Africa, as a country that consumes, produces and trades GM food, represents a <b>fitting</b> <b>case</b> study to investigate these dimensions {{in the context of a}} developing economy. There has been very little understanding about how the mandatory labelling law for GM food developed in South Africa. This study, thus, aims to analyse how this policy developed and has been implemented in South Africa, in order to draw wider conclusions about GM food labelling in developing countries. This has been achieved through review of the relevant literature, in-depth interviews with 27 stakeholders from industry, government, NGOs and the academic and scientific community, and document analysis. A stakeholder analysis approach was used for framing and informing the research findings of this study. This framework provided a stakeholder perspective through which to examine the policy development process of mandatory GM labelling. Findings from this research project reveal that the policy governing the mandatory labelling of GM foods in South Africa was developed and shaped by many significant events and decisions. However, the law evolved within a context of conflict from a diversity of stakeholders. Stakeholders, who participated in and contributed towards the process, had their own degree of "interest and power", which influenced and impacted on the GM labelling policy-making and the implementation processes. Research revealed that there were important issues that emerged during the policy development and implementation phases. These included: the effectiveness of stakeholder participation; the use of a "may contain" label; the percentage of the threshold level; and labelling costs. The stakeholders' viewpoints on each of these issues differed among different groups...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis explores {{business}} leaders’ {{attitudes to}} climate change. Situated in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia, participants were interviewed about {{their views on}} climate change and climate mitigation policies. As a major coal producing hub and home to the world’s largest coal port, the Hunter Valley is a <b>fitting</b> <b>case</b> study for a nation which has long seen its economic success as inextricably linked to the coal industry. Positioning climate change within Beck’s risk society (1992; 1999; 2009), the thesis explores Beck’s key proposition; {{that the success of}} modernisation has turned on humanity, and that this realisation has fundamentally challenged our social institutions. As a result, Beck has argued that we are facing new networks of allegiances. Formulated around our relationship to the particular risks of the second modernity, these allegiances go beyond traditional ‘class’ conflicts and boundaries. Yet Beck has been criticised for discounting the resilience of these power relations, which become difficult to trace in the absence of his own theory of practice. In order to resolve this tension, the thesis turns to Bourdieu’s (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992; Wacquant 1993) concept of the field of power as a means of understanding the relational aspects of how participants are responding to climate change. While many participants show indications of a growing awareness and concern about climate change, their ability to respond to these issues is severely limited by a doxic understanding of the economy. Over the period of research, the centre oriented Labor government faced a number of hurdles attempting to implement a price on carbon. While they eventually succeeded in implementing a carbon tax in 2012, this has now been disbanded by the conservative coalition of the Liberal and National parties. By documenting business leaders’ attitudes to climate change over this period, the thesis offers a unique perspective of where business leaders’ converge, and vary, in their attitudes to climate change, and how this impacts more broadly on attempts at climate mitigation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: 1000 {{children}} {{below the}} age of 15 years died from encephalitis in the states of UP, Bihar and Assam since 1978. JE vaccinations in 2010 and deep bore wells in 60 districts in India are the two preventive measures in use. Hypothesis generation through a time, place distribution study followed by a risk factor study would help target preventive and curative measures. A spatial temporal analysis of the 2012 encephalitis epidemic {{in the district of}} Gorakhpur, having the most cases, is reported. &# 13; Material and Method&# 13; Government of UP data on 714 cases of AES/JE occurring during 2012 in Gorakhpur district was analysed. Time and place distribution is described. Various hypotheses on mode of transmission besides other important features of the epidemic were generated. Data was used to create video maps of the 2012 AESJE epidemic using Epi-info 7. Onset of symptoms was used on the time axis and longitude-latitude data from residential details was used to describe the place distribution. Videos were interpreted to draw important inferences which may be used in planning a strategy to break the 2013 epidemic&# 13; Result:&# 13; Thirty (4. 20 %) of 714 patients <b>fitting</b> <b>case</b> definitions were confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis. 148 (20 %) died. 669 (93. 69 %) were below 15 years of age. Male to female ratio was 1. 45 : 1. On 9 th Aug 2012 the usual 5 cases per day mark was crossed with 10 cases/day reported. On 22 th August the peak of 19 cases/day was reached. On 11 th September the epidemic started receding at rates slower than the rise showing multiple spurts. The medical college had 1. 5 times the cases than anywhere else. On 10 th Dec the daily incidence had returned to under 5 levels. District wise place distribution of the 2009, 2011 and 2012 cases shows Gorakhpur as having 714 i. e. twice the number of cases than anywhere else in 2012. &# 13; Conclusion: &# 13; The epidemic is seasonal and perhaps spreads man to man. Mosquito having a life time range of 5 miles cannot spread the virus 30 kms away to the next case. For every case there are about 500 infected children making the number of < 15 yrs infected as 357000. Given 44, 36, 275 as 2012 population of Gorakhpur and 40 % (17, 74, 510) below 15 years old, 20 % were infected and transmitting. A reporting of more than 4 cases near 7. 8. 12 heralded a dangerous spurt up to 19 /day lasting about a month. The epidemic was mainly contributed by the medical college area where incidence rate was highest during the spurt perhaps because of a high case density produced by centripetal referral.

40|$|In the FABEL project several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} and published for retrieving similar cases {{in the domain of}} architectural design. In this paper we want to focus on a short description and foremost on integration of these approaches. We will introduce the most important approaches. As a first step towards integration, we suggest decomposing them into their main parts: representation of cases, similarity function and retrieval component. Using the first two parts each approach in a new search algorithm operating on a generic data structure, we built a shell called AspecT for an easy integration. We are positive that one can never have fully considered all aspects of a design. Therefore, we describe an open framework to define new aspects and to apply them depending on the context. Unfortunately, openness brings some difficulties along with it. One can not predict the importance of an aspect, until the situation assessment of the query is completed. In other words, it is impossible to define a static distribution of aspect weights that fits for all purposes. As a consequence, one can not predefine a static structure on the case base to speed tip retrieval processes. Dealing with this problem, we developed and published a special search algorithm that passes through a multidimensional case base, finding the best <b>fitting</b> <b>cases</b> within a short amount of time. This algorithm does not need any predefined structure on the case base except aspect specific relations between cases. Creativity of inventing new aspects of cases should not be hindered but one can ask whether or not a certain aspect are worth being regarded in searching for useful cases. The shell AspecT offers a tool to evaluate aspects. At first, formal criteria influence the initial weights of aspects but later on, the contribution of an aspect to find user accepted cases, determines the survival fitness of an aspect. The rule for living or dying is simple. Seldom used aspects disappear, whereas others become stronger. A short description regarding this work is given in last part...|$|R
