The axial and circumferential residual stresses are measured directly by x-ray diffraction at the free cylindrical surface exposed by machining and electropolishing.

The method is applicable only to cylindrical samples with rotationally symmetrical stress distributions from which complete cylindrical shells are removed for subsurface measurement. The method does not require prior knowledge of the stress-free lattice spacing, and thus provides a means of verifying neutron and x-ray diffraction methods of full tensor stress determination.

40|$|The {{carburizing}} atmosphere {{during the}} <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> process contains {{a large proportion}} of hydrogen. Due to the rapid diffusion of hydrogen a high amount of hydrogen can be absorbed by the carburizing component. The amount of absorbed hydrogen is dependent on some factors such as for example the carburizing time and component dimensions. HydrogenÂ diffused in material can then cause hydrogen embrittlement and in some cases cause cracking under a static load. This hydrogen must therefore be removed. High amounts of hydrogenÂ diffuse out spontaneously at room temperature. Tempering accelerates the process. The aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally measure the amount of absorbed hydrogen after <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> and hydrogen content after storage at room temperature and also after tempering. The effect of the enriching gas in carburizing furnace on hydrogen absorption was investigated in this study. Three steel grades with different content of alloying elements were used in this investigation. Steel samples were <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> by gas carburizing and tempering.

Both RA and RS can affect the contact fatigue performance of the camshaft.

The majority of research work refers to improvement of mechanical and tribological properties of coatings, deposited on 2 Ì† 7 hard 2 Ì† 7 substrates, i. e. ceramics and tool steels, and used for cutting and forming tools. However, requirements in the case of machine elements are quite different from those for tools. In addition to a hard, wear resistant surface with good frictional characteristics, a tough, fracture resistant core is necessary. In contrast to tool steels, hardened and tempered low-alloy steels have high fracture toughness. On the other hand, high hardness and internal compressive stresses of the case formed by proper thermochemical treatment can lead to increased load-carrying capacity of the steel substrate as well as to improved tribological properties of coated parts. Therefore, the combination of thermochemical treatment and hard-coating, known as a duplex treatment, would allow function sharing between the core material, the <b>hardened</b> <b>case</b> and wear resistant surface, which is of special interest for applications involving machine elements subjected to complex stresses.

The test is used to assess the resistance of surfaces to dynamic, high- cycle loading caused by the repeated impact of a cemented carbide ball. The subsequent observation and comparison of the wear craters produced (and their measured volumes) was used to identify which diffusion treatment (or treatment/coating combination) provided the most marked reduction in contact-induced de- formation and overall improvement in wear behaviour. A combination of nanoindentation, Knoop hardness microindentation, scratch adhesion, stylus profilometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy test and evaluation methods, was used to characterise the surfaces under investigation. Experimental results revealed that triode plasma diffusion treatments can provide exceptional improvements in the impact fatigue resistance, particularly when the dif- fusion process has been designed to maximise the resultant <b>hardened</b> <b>case</b> depth. Also, amongst the three coatings tested, PVD CrAlN was found to be the most suitable for applications involving such dynamic impact loading.

In order to compare and investigate different factors influencing tissue deformations under <b>case</b> <b>hardening,</b> four different plant tissue varieties (apple, potato, carrot and grape) are studied. The simulation results indicate that the inner cells of any given tissue undergo limited shrinkage and cell wall wrinkling compared to the <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> outer cell layers of the tissues. When comparing unique deformation characteristics of the different tissues, irrespective of the normalised moisture content, the cell size, cell fluid turgor pressure and cell wall characteristics influence the tissue response to <b>case</b> <b>hardening...</b>|$|R
