Similarly, by supplementing "forest area development schemes", {{it would be possible to}} increase the mobilisation of timber produced on small (1 to 10 Â ha) and medium (10 to 25 Â ha) forest estates: more forestry cooperatives or local forest agencies and a new timber pre-sale mode adapted to small <b>forest</b> <b>estates</b> are necessary (sales subject to the buyer's choice of purchasing standing timber or cut wood delivered to a depot by the seller).

30|$|This paper expands on {{previous}} work by surveying private companies within New Zealand’s forestry sector {{to determine their}} uptake and use of geospatial technologies. A specific objective of the survey was to determine what remote sensing technologies they use to acquire data for their <b>forest</b> <b>estates</b> and what geospatial software they use to create, edit, and analyse their data. Other objectives of this survey were to determine the common uses of remotely sensed data, the common analysis techniques, and whether barriers existed to acquisition and use of geospatial data for forest management. Although this study focused only on forestry companies in New Zealand, there are international implications. Of the 17 respondents, seven have international <b>forest</b> <b>estates.</b> The tools and technologies used by these respondents may be indicative of those used by those same companies in other countries.|$|R
