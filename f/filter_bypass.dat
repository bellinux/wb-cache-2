50|$|Most {{pressurized}} lubrication systems incorporate an overpressure {{relief valve}} to allow oil {{to bypass the}} filter if its flow restriction is excessive, to protect the engine from oil starvation. <b>Filter</b> <b>bypass</b> may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The overpressure relief valve is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback valve to hold oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback valve, pressurized oil would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|E

The air <b>filter</b> <b>bypass</b> found on aircraft engines is not used, because the air filter on automobiles is not normally exposed to the elements - at least, {{not so much to}} allow an obstructive build-up of snow and/or ice upon it - and because it is usually mounted closer to the cylinder block, such that it is able to absorb enough engine heat to keep itself from freezing up (airflow through the generally large-aperture filter is slower than through the throttle body itself, and thus less influenced by cooling effects). However, this is not always sufficient, and some automobiles have a history of temporary engine failure during rain or snow conditions (power output drops below that sufficient to continue propelling the vehicle, or even to prevent stalling whilst unladen, and the car cannot be driven/engine restarted until it has stood awhile without a mass quantity of cold, wet air travelling through it, so that the residual engine heat can melt the accumulated ice).|$|E

Eight INL four-cycle diesel-engine buses used to transport INL employees on various routes and six INL Chevrolet Tahoes with gasoline engines are equipped with oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> systems from the puraDYN Corporation. This quarter, three additional buses were equipped with <b>bypass</b> <b>filters</b> from Refined Global Solutions. Oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filters</b> are reported to have an engine oil filtering capability of less than 1 micron. Both the puraDYN and Refined Global Solutions <b>bypass</b> <b>filters</b> have a heating chamber to remove liquid contaminate from the oil. During the quarter, the eleven diesel engine buses traveled 62, 188 miles, and as of January 3, 2005 the buses had accumulated 643, 036 total test miles. Two buses had their engine oil changed this quarter. In one bus, the oil was changed due to its degraded quality as determined by a low total base number (30. 0 Abs/cm). Although {{a total of six}} buses have had their oil changed during the last 26 months, by using the oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filters</b> the buses in the evaluation avoided 48 oil changes, which equates to 1, 680 quarts (420 gallons) of new oil not consumed and 1, 680 quarts of waste oil not generated. Therefore, over 80 % of the oil normally required for oil-changes was not used, and, consequently, the evaluation achieved over 80 % reduction in the amount of waste oil normally generated. The six Tahoe test vehicles traveled 39, 514 miles, and as of January 3, 2005 the Tahoes had accumulated 189, 970 total test miles. The Tahoe filter test is in transition.

40|$|Residential air {{conditioning}} {{is responsible for}} {{a substantial amount of}} peak electrical demand and energy consumption throughout most of the United States. Coil fouling, the deposition of indoor dusts and other particulate matter on evaporator heat exchangers, increases system pressure drop and, correspondingly, decreases system air flow and air conditioner performance. In this paper, we apply experimental and simulation results describing particle deposition on evaporator coils as well as research about indoor particle and dust concentrations to determine coil fouling rates. The results suggest that typical coils foul enough to double evaporator pressure drop in about 7. 5 years, much sooner than the expected 15 - 30 year life time for an evaporator coil. The most important parameters in determining coil fouling times are the efficiency of the filter and indoor particle concentrations, although <b>filter</b> <b>bypass</b> and duct and coil design are important as well. The reduced air flows that result from coil fouling cause typical efficiency and capacity degradations of less than 5 %, however they can be much greater for marginal systems or extreme conditions. These energy issues, as well as possible indoor air quality issues resulting from fouling by biological aerosols, suggest that regular coil cleaning to ameliorate low flow and the elimination of <b>filter</b> <b>bypass</b> should be an important part of residential {{air conditioning}} commissioning and maintenance practices...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES:This report characterizes {{pathways}} to first psychiatric admission and describes {{their relationship to}} patients' sociodemographic and clinical features. METHODS: Eighty-four patients consecutively admitted {{for the first time}} in 2009 - 2010 to a Lisbon district psychiatric department were interviewed. Associations between pathways and clinical and sociodemographic variables were explored through univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Most patients (N= 49, 58 %) went directly to the psychiatric emergency department and were admitted, without contacting any other care providers. This pathway was significantly associated with male gender, involuntary admission, referral by a family member, fewer people per room in the household, and lower probability of previous contact with mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: The most striking feature was the high prevalence of direct access to the psychiatric emergency department with subsequent admission. Use of this direct pathway suggests that these patients were bypassing care filters, with negative consequences.

40|$|To {{validate}} an {{analytic model}} of <b>filter</b> <b>bypass,</b> an ASHRAE Standard 52. 2 - 2007 compliant apparatus was modified to accept filters with a known bypass gap. The test matrix covered filter efficiencies from MERV 2 through 14, gap sizes up to 32 mm, and straight-through and U-shaped bypass gap configurations. The {{results show that}} as the filter efficiency increases, bypass causes a greater decrease in particle removal efficiency. Less efficiency degradation occurs when a flow restriction through the bypass gap is introduced, such as caused by the right angle bends of a U-shaped rack channel. The model is in close agreement (± 5 % for all particle sizes) with the experimental results for most cases. However, when more complex filter rack geometries are considered, the model does not predict the effective efficiency as well. The {{results suggest that the}} impacts of bypass are significant and can be predicted for many important scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Current {{models and}} test methods for {{determining}} filter efficiency ignore <b>filter</b> <b>bypass,</b> {{the air that}} circumvents filter media because of gaps around the filter or filter housing. In this paper, we develop a general model to estimate the size-resolved particle removal efficiency, including bypass, of HVAC filters. The model applies the measured pressure drop of the filter to determine the airflow through the bypass cracks and accounts for particle loss in the bypass cracks. We consider a particle size range of 0. 01 to 10 µm, nine typical commercial and residential filters in clean and dust-loaded configurations, and {{a wide range of}} bypass gaps typical of those found in real filter installations. The model suggests that gaps on the order of 1 mm around well-seated filters have little effect on the performance of most filters. For high pressure drop filters, small gaps decrease filter performance and large gaps substantially decrease filter performance. Because higher efficiency filters also typically have a larger pressure drop, bypass tends to have a larger effect on high performance filters. The results provided here suggest that bypass can dramatically affect filter performance...|$|E

40|$|Popular User-Review Social Networks (URSNs) [...] -such as Dianping, Yelp, and Amazon [...] -are {{often the}} targets of {{reputation}} attacks in which fake reviews are posted in order to boost or diminish the ratings of listed products and services. These attacks often emanate from a collection of accounts, called Sybils, which are collectively managed {{by a group of}} real users. A new advanced scheme, which we term elite Sybil attacks, recruits organically highly-rated accounts to generate seemingly-trustworthy and realistic-looking reviews. These elite Sybil accounts taken together form a large-scale sparsely-knit Sybil network for which existing Sybil fake-review defense systems are unlikely to succeed. In this paper, we conduct the first study to define, characterize, and detect elite Sybil attacks. We show that contemporary elite Sybil attacks have a hybrid architecture, with the first tier recruiting elite Sybil workers and distributing tasks by Sybil organizers, and with the second tier posting fake reviews for profit by elite Sybil workers. We design ElsieDet, a three-stage Sybil detection scheme, which first separates out suspicious groups of users, then identifies the campaign windows, and finally identifies elite Sybil users participating in the campaigns. We perform a large-scale empirical study on ten million reviews from Dianping, by far the most popular URSN service in China.

40|$|A {{retrofit}} project {{related to}} an Al 2 O 3 calcination flue gas treatment line, consisting in the installation of a fabric filter downstream an existing electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was the object of this study. In this case, {{the replacement of the}} existing exhaust fan with a more performing one would have been potentially exposed the existing precipitator to suction conditions that did not fall within the process conditions considered when the ESP was designed. In other words, performing a detailed safety analysis focused on the interface between new and existing plants it was highlighted a possible risk of implosion that would not be easily found by following the most common classical approaches as the historical analysis or an HAZOP limited to the new equipments. This hazard would not have been easily reduced by installing reinforcements due to the difficulty (both technical and economical) to modify such existing equipment. The chosen approach was to face the problem analogously to the protection of a vessel from overpressure, that means to size a direct action PSV (counterweight actuated), which opens when a given differential pressure (with opposite sign with respect to the traditional PSV design) is reached. The risk thus determined was translated in terms of a worst case scenario, on the basis of which the design of safeguards has been carried out. In particular, this scenario was identified considering that all the pressure drops are concentrated upstream the equipment to protect, exposing the filter to maximum suction levels. The presence of a fabric <b>filter</b> <b>bypass</b> duct, allowing direct communication between fan and ESP, the complete obstruction of a duct upstream of it and the fan running at full rotational speed were the main hypotheses constituting the worst case scenario. Design choices were verified and validated through a computational fluid-dynamics analysis, evidencing that CFD can be a powerful and useful tool to address safety design issues, allowing to numerically test safeguards actions and consequently evaluating the impact that design choices would have for the purposes of risk reduction and mitigation...|$|E

This represents an avoidance of 39 oil changes, which equates to 1, 374 quarts (343 gallons) of new oil not consumed and, furthermore, 1, 374 quarts of waste oil not generated. One bus had its oil changed due to the degraded quality of the engine oil. Also this quarter, the six Tahoe test vehicles traveled 48, 193 miles; to date, the six Tahoes have accumulated 109, 708 total test miles. The oil for all six of the Tahoes was changed this quarter due to low Total Base Numbers (TBN). The oil used initially in the Tahoe testing was recycled oil; the recycled oil has been replaced with Castrol virgin oil, and the testing was restarted. However, the six Tahoe’s did travel a total of 98, 266 miles on the initial engine oil. This represents an avoidance of 26 oil changes, which equates to 130 quarts (32. 5 gallons) of new oil not consumed and, consequently, 130 quarts of waste oil not generated. Based on the number of oil changes avoided by the test buses and Tahoes to date, the potential engine oil savings if an oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> system were used was estimated for the INEEL, DOE complex and all Federal fleets of on-road vehicles. The estimated potential annual engine oil savings for the three fleets are: INEEL – 3, 400 gallons, all DOE fleets – 32, 000 gallons, and all Federal fleet – 1. 7 million gallons...|$|R
50|$|High {{efficiency}} {{oil filters}} are {{a type of}} <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> that are claimed to allow extended oil drain intervals. HE oil filters typically have pore sizes of 3 micrometres, which studies have shown reduce engine wear. Some fleets {{have been able to}} increase their drain intervals up to 5-10 times.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a methodology to automatically turn arbitrary ARMv 8 programs into alphanumeric executable polymorphic shellcodes. Shellcodes generated {{in this way}} can evade detection and <b>bypass</b> <b>filters,</b> broadening the attack surface of ARM-powered devices such as smartphones.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the segmentation of pulmonary regions on thoracic cross-sectional images obtained by X-ray computer tomography. Relying on priori information about the general location and morphology of the lungs, our method {{is based on the}} interpretation of the histogram, mapping each peak to a group of anatomical structures. We also applied morphologic <b>filtering</b> to <b>bypass</b> misleading effects of pulmonary blood vessels. This method has been applied to several CT images from different patients and, since it is intrinsically non-iterative, proved to be much faster than the more general method of active contours...|$|R
