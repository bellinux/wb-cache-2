50|$|Soon after {{beginning}} the practise of surgery in New York City, Carnochan attained a high reputation {{on account of}} his success in operations never before attempted. In 1852 he severed and tied the femoral artery, effecting a cure in an exaggerated case of nutrition (elephantiasis arabrum). The same year he removed an entire lower jaw, with both condyles. In 1854 he removed the entire ulna, and also the entire radius. In 1856 he cut down and removed the entire trunk of the second branch of the fifth pair of cranial nerves, the nerve being cut from the <b>infra-orbital</b> <b>foramen</b> to the foramen rotundum, {{at the base of the}} skull, involving an operation through the malar bone. The removal of this nerve had been decided upon to secure relief in a chronic case of neuralgia. It was entirely successful, and made the bold and accurate operator famous throughout the world. In 1851 he was appointed professor of surgery in the New York Medical College. He occupied other professional appointments, including that of surgeon-in-chief to the State Immigrant Hospital. He published Congenital Dislocations (1850) and Contributions to Operative Surgery and Surgical Pathology (1860, 1877-86). His professional activity continued almost to the day of his death; so in September 1887, a month before he died, he attended the International Medical Congress at Washington and read two papers.|$|E

Studies on bilateral locational relationship of SOF, IOF and mental foramen in foetal skull are still lacking, so aim of our study was 1) to examine the various morphometric variations (the location and shape) of SOF, IOF and mental foramina of the facial skeleton in human foetuses at different age of gestation 2) to establish whether or not, the location of these foramina get changed as the foetus matures and 3) to establish the pattern of growth of aforesaid foramina. For these 40 formalin-fixed foetuses between 17 and 32 weeks of gestation were studied for SOF, IOF and mental foramina. Foetuses {{were divided into two}} groups according to age. It was interesting to note that supra-orbital and men-tal foramina were placed in the same sagittal plane {{on both sides of the}} midline. <b>Infra-orbital</b> <b>foramen</b> was located lateral to sagittal plane for supra-orbital and mental foramina. The shape of SOF was recorded as a notch or rarely a foramen, whereas the shape of IOF and mental foramen were determined as a circular and a...|$|E
