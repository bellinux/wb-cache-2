50|$|When {{you refer}} to the word <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> it can come in many forms such as a mobile <b>data</b> <b>pack.</b> A mobile <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> refers to an add-on which can enable you to boost the amount of data which you can use on your mobile phone. The rate at which you use your data can also be monitored, so {{you know how much}} data you have left. Mobile data is a service which {{provides}} a similar service to Wi-Fi and allows you to connect to the Internet. So the purpose of a <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> is {{to increase the amount of}} data that your mobile has access to. An example of a mobile <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> can be found on the references.|$|E
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> 4 was {{released}} on 9 June 2016, and is the final update for Pro Evolution Soccer 2016. The <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> includes official UEFA Euro 2016 kits for the national teams of Croatia, England, France, Portugal and Turkey. It also adds new official kits for Brazil, the Netherlands, CD Lugo, Santos, Flamengo, and Torino. The <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> also features two new Adidas boots - Adidas: X 16+ PURECHAOS, and the ACE 16+ PURECONTROL.|$|E
50|$|A <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> (or fact pack) is a pre-made {{database}} {{that can be}} fed to a software, such as software agents, Internet bots or chatterbots, to teach information and facts, which it can later look up. In other words, a <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> {{can be used to}} feed minor updates into a system.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the fictional nature of the game, several fans and unaffiliated {{websites}} have created 3rd party <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> that add real leagues, teams and players into the game, for example, the league featured in the game as 'National League' becomes the National Hockey League. Many of these <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> can have been uploaded to the Steam Workshop which allows users to import real life information into their game.|$|R

5000|$|Quake 3 also {{integrated}} {{a relatively}} elaborate cheat-protection system called [...] "pure server." [...] Any client connecting to a pure server automatically has pure mode enabled, and while pure mode is enabled only files within <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> can be accessed. Clients are disconnected if their <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> fail {{one of several}} integrity checks. The cgame.qvm file, with its high potential for cheat-related modification, is subject to additional integrity checks. Developers must manually deactivate pure server to test maps or mods {{that are not in}} <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> using the PK3 file format. Later versions supplemented pure server with PunkBuster support, though all the hooks to it are absent from the source code release because PunkBuster is closed source software and including support for it in the source code release would have caused any redistributors/reusers of the code to violate the GPL.|$|R
50|$|Knowledge GridA {{metadata}} layer (called the Database Knowledge Grid) stores compact {{information about}} the contents and relationships between the <b>data</b> <b>packs,</b> replacing {{the concept of a}} traditional database index.|$|R

50|$|A <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> DataPack Definition {{is similar}} to a data packet it {{contains}} loads of information (data) and stores it within a pack where the data can be compressed to reduce its file size. Only certain programs can read a <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> therefore when the data is packed it is vital to know whether the receiving program is able to unpack the data. An example of data packs which are able to effective deliver information {{can be found on the}} reference page.|$|E

As a single load profile forecast value {{is much smaller}} than the modulus, <b>data</b> <b>packing</b> is used for better exploiting the input domain. Therefore, not a single value is encrypted, but all k values of the load profile forecast are packed, encrypted, and sent as one message. <b>Data</b> <b>packing</b> is achieved by shifting values to a certain bit range, such that for all operations, the value remains within that range [13], e.g., for k values and a range of b bits v=v_ 1 |v_ 2 |... |v_k=∑ _i= 1 ^k v_i 2 ^b(i- 1).|$|R

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> 1 was {{released}} on 29 October 2015. The update added 8 new teams, new pes 20boot dfstyles, new jerseys for some teams, 70 new and updated player likenesses, updated player rosters (covering transfers made up to 30 August), and some changes to gameplay.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> {{contains}} 60 {{cards and}} has a complete playset of new cards (typically 3 copies each of 20 cards), and {{is part of a}} six-pack [...] "cycle". A new pack is released monthly during the cycle; between cycles the wait is 3 to 4 months.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinguishable}} features of the series were the updates; the game had a built-in calendar and league tracking utility and so owners of the game could connect to Dinamic's servers and update their data monthly. Some of the data (like photos) could not be fit inside a floppy, and <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> were made available in gaming magazines or via direct request. As the CD-ROM replaced the floppy versions (around 1996), {{there was no need}} for additional <b>data</b> <b>packs,</b> but there was still a final update (released in the end of the season) that would complete all league tracking data and Robinsons' comments.|$|R
40|$|IEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} and its marketing technology Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) {{is one of}} the leading technology that gain benefit of adopting orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) as its multiple access technique. OFDMA gives flexibility in resources allocation to accommodate a large number of users supporting several services classes with quality of service (QoS). This loads big challenges on its resource allocation. One of the key performance factors of OFDMA resource allocation is its downlink <b>data</b> <b>packing</b> mechanism. In IEEE 802. 16 standard based OFDMA the downlink <b>data</b> is <b>packed</b> into down link frames in the form of rectangular slots called burst. The standard leaves details of packing mechanism as an open issue for researchers and manufacturer to implement. Therefore recently several algorithms have been proposed in literature. This paper endeavours to identify key factors and tradeoffs issues associated with designing of downlink <b>data</b> <b>packing</b> algorithm for WiMAX based IEEE 802. 16 through a competitive survey of recent proposed algorithms...|$|R

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> 2 was {{released}} on 3 December 2015. The update added 51 new player likenesses, updated player rosters (covering transfers made up to 19 October), eight new boot styles, two new ball designs, and new entrance sequences for Copa Libertadores and Sudamericana matches. The Estadio do Maracana stadium was made available exclusively for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other home {{computers}} at the time, the Adam {{did not have}} its BASIC interpreter permanently stored in ROM. Instead, it featured a built-in electronic typewriter and word processor, SmartWriter, {{as well as the}} Elementary Operating System (EOS) OS kernel and the 8kB OS-7 ColecoVision operating system. The SmartBASIC interpreter was delivered on a proprietary-format Digital <b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> tape cassette.|$|E
5000|$|After {{an eight-year}} hiatus, Eastside Hockey Manager was {{initially}} released as a Steam Early Access title on March 26, 2015. Lead designer Risto Remes does {{the bulk of}} the work for this version of EHM, when not working on the Football Manager series. [...] Following this release, the game was updated every fortnight, during which time game-play was constantly refined and new playable leagues were added. On 1 December, 2015 it was announced that EHM had officially left Early Access. When first launched, EHM featured 11 playable leagues and competitions, whereas by the time the game had left Early Access that figure had risen to an excess of 30 playable leagues and competitions. On 11 May 2016, the first official <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> was released after a licensing agreement was signed with the Elite Ice Hockey League. This <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> allows the user to include all the official player and team data and images for the 10 teams within the league.|$|E
50|$|On 12 August 2005 {{the first}} Live edition of series II was published. It {{had a more}} {{distinctive}} graphical design, used the squashfs technology (2 GB of <b>data</b> <b>packed</b> on just one CD) and unionfs. It detected the hardware and configured the X Server automatically.|$|R

50|$|Data packs are {{commonly}} used within the gaming industry to provide minor updates within their games. When a user downloads an update for a game they will be downloading loads of data packs which will contain updates for the game such as minor bug fixes or additional content. An example of a <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> used to update a game {{can be found on}} the references.|$|E
50|$|The {{pesticides}} {{review by}} the European Union led to herbicides containing ammonium sulfamate becoming unlicensed, and therefore effectively banned, from 2008. This situation arose as the Irish Rapporteur refused to review the data supplied unless it contained details of animal testing on dogs. As there was already substantial animal data within the package supplied the <b>data</b> <b>pack</b> holder felt further tests without substantiation would cause unnecessary animal suffering. Its licence was not withdrawn on grounds of safety or efficacy.|$|E
5000|$|The Adam's Digital <b>Data</b> <b>Pack</b> drives, {{although}} {{faster and}} of higher capacity than the audio cassette drives used for competing computers, were less reliable {{and still not}} {{as fast as a}} floppy disk drive. At the time of Adam's design, tape drives were still a popular storage medium for home users, but by the time of its release, floppy disks had dropped in cost dramatically and were the preferred medium. Coleco eventually shipped a 160kB 5¼ inch disk drive for the Adam.|$|E
50|$|Fantasy Flight reprinted the {{original}} card set and various <b>data</b> <b>packs</b> after they sold out; {{this is similar}} to the company's support of its other Living Card Games.
