50|$|The type of <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> also varies among {{different}} tools. But a distinction is necessary between the intended use, what the tool maker designed the tool for, and actual use. This {{is an important}} distinction to note as tools {{can be used for}} more than its intended function or designed for several purposes. An often noted example from modern culture are screwdrivers which are designed for driving screws but are regularly used to open cans of paint. This type of multi-purpose tool is noted in lithic assemblages by ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies. Basic <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> types include step fractures, snap fractures, micro-flake scars, and edge rounding. Fractures are differentiated by looking at both fracture initiation and propagation. Fracture initiation is defined as where and how the fracture of an edge begins. Fracture propagation is defined by the path a crack follows, and the degree of the crack’s growth. Fractures are often used to note how tools are created but also used in wear studies. For example, fracturing can help note whether a tool was used in an outward bending action rather than a downward force which can cause a flake to detach and create damage. In addition to flake scars, abrasion, edge rounding, and striations occurring after tool use, one must be careful to note whether this was from actual use or from handling after excavation/collection. Alterations to a tool’s edge or surface can result from improper handling or storage. For example, two artifacts within the same bag can cause wear marks from constant interaction, also the bags themselves have been noted to cause wear on artifacts.|$|E

50|$|Patricia C. Anderson (of Centre d’Etudes Préhistoire, Antiquité et Moyen Age del CNRS), {{discovered}} archaeological {{remains that}} demonstrate {{the existence of}} threshing boards at least 8,000 years old in the Near East and Balkans. The artefacts are lithic flakes and, above all obsidian or flint blades, recognizable through the type of microscopic wear that it has. Her work was completed by Jacques Chabot (of the Centre interuniversitaire d'études sur les lettres, les arts et les traditions, CELAT), who has studied Mitanni (northern Mesopotamia and Armenia). Both count among their specialties the study of microwear analysis, through which {{it is possible to}} take a particular piece of flint or obsidian (to take the most common examples) and determine the tasks for which it was used.Concretely, the cutting of cereals leaves a very characteristic glossy pattern of wear, owing to the presence of microscopic mineral particles (phytoliths) in the stalks of the plants. Therefore, scholars using controlled experimental replication studies and functional analysis with a scanning electron microscope are able to identify stone artefacts that were used as sickles or the teeth of threshing boards. The <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> on the pieces used in threshing boards is distinct because, besides the glossy abrasion characteristic of cutting cereals, they have micro-scars from chipping, {{as a result of the}} blows of the threshing board against the rock surface of the threshing floor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of taphonomic {{processes}} on 500 -thousand-year-old stone points from Kathu Pan 1, South Africa by statistically comparing archaeological <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> distributions on the points to competing models of <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> formation. We found that both taphonomic and behavioral processes influenced <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> formation on the KP 1 points, and the KP 1 <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> distribution is best explained {{by a combination of}} taphonomic effects and use as spear tips. The <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> distribution method employed here advances studies of Stone Age weaponry because {{it can be used to}} quantitatively assess {{the effect of}} taphonomic and behavioral processes on stone tips without relying on subjective evaluations that attribute causation to individual wear features...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{behavioral}} inferences from macroscopic <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> {{observations on}} lithic assemblages relies on linking observed damage patterns to behavioral processes identified during experimentation. Such methods have proven useful. However, critics frequently cite equifinality between different processes and wear traces on individual artifacts {{as well as}} inconsistent inter-observer agreement as problems with a ‘low-powered approach ’ to lithic use-wear. One potential source of information that has received less attention is the patterns of <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> detectable at the assemblage scale. Such patterns are only discernable by quantification of the collective distribution and frequency of <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> on individual specimens. Here we use GIS to digitize and spatially reference artifacts to standardize and quantify <b>edge</b> <b>damage.</b> We applied this method to an assemblage of Middle Stone Age convergent flakes from Pinnacle Point Cave 13 B, South Africa (165 - 90 ka) {{and a series of}} experimental flakes recreated for several tasks including use in a calibrated crossbow experiment...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{analyses}} of stone tool assemblages face {{a number of}} methodological challenges. Aside from determining specific uses, {{it can be difficult}} to know which artifacts in an assemblage were used at all. Typically retouch is taken as a proxy for indicating past use, but ignoring unretouched flakes means excluding the overwhelming majority of most assemblages. Assessing whether an unretouched flake has been used is complicated. <b>Edge</b> <b>damage</b> on flakes can be caused by use or by taphonomic processes. One of the more important of these processes is trampling. Experiments have shown that trampling can create damage mimicking retouch, and unlike some other taphonomic processes trampling is otherwise difficult to detect. One possible solution is to look for patterning in the placement (left vs. right, ventral vs. dorsal, proximal vs. distal) of <b>edge</b> <b>damage,</b> and recent studies using GIS based approaches have shown the utility of this method at an assemblage level. Here we trampled a set of experimental flakes made from two raw materials on two substrate types and analyzed the <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> patterns using a newly developed image analysis program that is similar to previous GIS based approaches. We found that a previously unquantified variable, edge angle, is strongly correlated with the likelihood of damage. Thus in circumstances where edge angles are non-randomly distributed across flake types, trampling damage will be patterned. These results have implications for previously published <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> studies, and further indicate that basic flake mechanics need to be considered in studies where function is inferred from <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> patterns. Approaches to the archaeological record that employs assemblage level assessments of <b>edge</b> <b>damage,</b> must consider a range of factors when inferring behaviors from these patterns...|$|E

Thse trials indicate that most of the <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> on Irish halberds results from impact with other halberds, in a yielding environment (suggesting that both halberds could move) and at tightly-controlled engergy-levels which remained capable of lethal efrect.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will give}} an {{overview}} {{on the results of}} a research project dedicated to the analysis of rotor forcing due to in-service trailing <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> of high pressure turbine nozzle guide vanes (HPT NGVs). Due to the extremely high temperatures in this region of the engine, which on average exceed the melting temperature of the employed vane material by several hundred degrees during takeoff, any unintended decrease of the vane cooling mass flow can lead to a loss of trailing edge material. The structure of the NGV can withstand a significant amount of trailing edge material loss, but the damage changes the flow through the affected passage, causing a so-called low engine order excitation of the rotor blades downstream. This can lead –in extreme cases– to high cycle fatigue failure of the rotor blade caused by resonances in the operating range. Thus {{it is very important to}} be able to quantify the damage-induced rotor forcing in case a trailing <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> is detected during routine engine inspection. This quantification can be obtained by solving the unsteady fluid flow, typically modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations together with a suitable turbulence model. In order to gain confidence in the CFD analysis results for those configurations, a dedicated measurement campaign with different representative trailing <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> shapes has been set up at the DLR Göttingen, including both steady, unsteady and pressure-sensitive paint measurements and on both stationary and rotating components. The results of those measurements together with post-test CFD simulations will be presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Ussing {{chambers}} {{are commonly}} utilized for in vitro investigations into gastrointestinal permeability. However, their sensitivity and applicability {{to the small}} intestine have not been well characterized. Methods: In order to investigate the effects of experimentally induced damage and the relative contribution of the mucosa and muscularis externa layers to transmural permeability in the small intestine, stomach and colon, normal rat intestinal tissues were mounted in Ussing chambers with or without removal of the muscularis externa or mucosal layers. Gastric tissues were damaged in vivo by exposure to indomethacin (100 mg kg - 1), while ileal tissues were damaged in vitro by 0. 4 M NaCl. Tissue damage was assessed histologically, while permeability parameters included conductance (G), potential difference (PD) and mucosal to serosal flux of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Results: Damage localized to the tissue edges (<b>edge</b> <b>damage)</b> accounted for 25 %- 50 % of the exposed epithelial length in the ileum, while less than 20 % of stomach and colon epithelium was affected by <b>edge</b> <b>damage.</b> In the damaged stomach, a 20 % reduction in epithelialization was accompanied by increases in G (P < 0. 001) and HRP (P < 0. 01) flux. Removal of the muscularis externa did not affect mucosal viability in the undamaged ileum or colon although HRP flux in the colon, but not ileum, was increased (P < 0. 01). Removal of the ileal mucosa produced increases in G and HRP flux, while PD was maintained. Conclusion: We conclude that the Ussing chamber technique is suitable for application to studies of gastric and colonic permeability in rats. However, owing to the prevalence and extent of <b>edge</b> <b>damage</b> in the small intestine, we would caution {{against the use of}} this technique for permeability studies in this region of the gastrointestinal tract in the rat...|$|E
