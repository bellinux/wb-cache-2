6000|$|... "Oh, {{you have}} made me so happy!" [...] she said tremulously. [...] "Oh, you can never know how happy! Nothing hurts now--nothing ever can hurt, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> care." ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> That evening--a week ago, {{when he was}} squiring me {{home from}} the concert. It was raining, and my face was wet; he said {{that was why he}} did it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes; you {{are always}} good to me; and as to my uncle, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean to be unkind. I should not fear that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The pore boy tries; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> Jacob; and <b>he</b> {{wants to}} please you. But he {{give up a}} good deal when he give up bein' a preacher; I s'pose we ought to {{remember}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course Lew likes me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> and <b>I</b> {{want him}} to," [...] said Betty. [...] "But <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care as {{you seem to}} think. Grandmother Watkins said the same. I am sure {{both of you are}} wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{he emerged}} from legal infancy," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Skimpole, [...] "he parted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up, I believe, with Vholes. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> because I introduced him to Vholes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{more than}} suspicion. Hear me calmly. I speak for your good. I know this man's {{influence}} was fatal to your father. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> all {{in his power to}} widen the breach with your grandfather.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be {{one with}} you," [...] the girl smiled. [...] "Poor Nash isn't worth talking about. What was it {{but a small}} {{question}} of action when he preached to you, as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{to give up your}} seat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No: {{it is not}} so much that. But--it {{sounds very}} silly--if I attempt to play or sing in his presence, I become so frightfully nervous that <b>I</b> hardly <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> am <b>doing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not like my singing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My poor child,' said Miss Mohun, 'it is {{a terrible}} {{position}} for you; but you are doing quite right. I do not believe Mr. White would go much by what that young man says, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not think highly of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I like Mr. Hubbard," [...] {{said her}} mother placidly. [...] "It's very kind of {{him to come to}} such plain folks as we are, {{whenever}} we ask him; now that his wife can't come, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it because <b>he</b> likes us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{heard me}} ask Pa to buy her. He heard Clarence {{say that he}} would bid her in for me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> And yet he goes in and outbids Clarence, and buys her himself. Do you think any gentleman would do that, Puss Russell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} stupid," [...] said Bessie, [...] "of {{none of those}} girls to have Uncle George to marry them. My aunt fancied he would be nervous, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> marry a couple when Mr. Lifford was away; I mean him to marry me, as I told them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{quite believe}} that, at any rate," [...] said my cousin Melville with unction. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{although}} he always leaves {{it out of}} the story when he tells it to me. But then he forgets that I have had the occasional privilege of making a third party in these good long talks.|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{summed up}} the unending nature of the debate when he wrote: [...] "I have no answers. All I can do is wonder how much more English cricket might have got out of Graeme Hick had he been handled differently. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do so wish I {{were younger}} and better looking," [...] she sighed to the bosom friend. [...] "For myself, I don't mind; I have {{got used to}} it. But it is so hard on Reggie. <b>He</b> feels it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> though <b>he</b> never openly complains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; I {{often feel}} that, when I {{think of the}} hard {{struggle}} she must have had. Though I was very young then, I can remember the shabby boardinghouses we stayed in, and my mother’s pale, anxious face when she and {{my father used to}} talk in the evenings. He seldom speaks about those days, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not forget.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} they dressed me up, but I didn't {{tell you that}} they {{powdered}} and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> though he didn't say so, and one man called me 'a doll'. I knew it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That boy put it {{into his}} head, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did!</b> He's a capital fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when we pass," [...] said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so difficult------ I've {{never before}} {{in all my}} life tried {{to get to the bottom}} of my mind. For one thing, I've not treated Willie properly. He--he counted on me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I was his hope. I was a promised delight--{{something}}, something to crown life--better than anything he had ever had. And a secret pride. [...] . He lived upon me. I knew--when we two began to meet together, you and I------ It was a sort of treachery to him------" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'This snipe,' says Luke to the judge, 'shot and {{wilfully}} punctured with malice and forethought one of {{the most}} respected and prominent citizens of the town of Bildad, Texas, Your Honor. And in so doing laid himself liable to the penitence of law and order. And I hereby make claim and demand restitution of the State of New York City for the said alleged criminal; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> it.' ...|$|R
60|$|So I sat {{and told}} him, ox by ox, cow by cow, and heifer by heifer, forgetting none; and Chaka listened silently {{as one who}} is asleep. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not sleep, for all the while the firelight flickered in his fierce eyes. Also <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> but torment me, or that, perhaps, he would learn of the cattle before he killed me. At length all the tale was told.|$|R
5000|$|Botham {{summed up}} the unending nature of the debate when he wrote: [...] "I have no answers. All I can do is wonder how much more English cricket might have got out of Graeme Hick had he been handled differently. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> as well."As for Hick himself, he was asked {{after the end of}} his England career whether he {{considered}} himself a success or a failure. His answer: [...] "a bit of both".|$|R
6000|$|... "That is no man's business, {{so long as}} I hurt nobody," [...] cried Dick passionately. [...] "I tell you," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} the crowd, which had quickly assembled, [...] "I found this fellow skulking in the bush close to where the body was found, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it, because he all but murdered me not many months ago, and there," [...] he continued, {{with a look of}} surprise, pointing straight at our hero, [...] "is a man who can swear to the truth of what I say!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The words {{brought her}} back to herself. She {{unfolded}} my arms with slow reluctance. [...] "No, dearest," [...] she said, earnestly, with a face where pride fought hard against love. [...] "That is WHY, above all things, I did not want you to follow me. I love you; I trust you: you love me; you trust me. But I never will marry anyone till I have succeeded in clearing my father's memory. <b>I</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not do it; I KNOW Sebastian did. But that is not enough. I must prove it, I must prove it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Disobedient boy! He {{shall be}} {{severely}} punished, if I ever get him again. Laurie winked at this prank; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Just like him. Won't the two rascals have a splendid time? Wish I was with them! Don't believe that crazy boy took even a night-gown with him, or an overcoat. Well, {{there will be}} two patients for us to nurse when they get back, if they ever do. Those reckless express trains always go down precipices, and burn up, or telescope. Oh! my Ted, my precious boy, how can I let him go so far away from me?' ...|$|E
60|$|I heard Don bark. Turning {{the corner}} of the cliff wall I saw him on a narrow shelf. He was coming toward me and when he reached me he faced again to the wall and barked fiercely. The hair on his neck bristled. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not fancy that narrow strip of rock, nor did I. But a sudden, grim, cold {{something}} had taken possession of me, and I stepped forward.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{expect a}} battle, {{by the way}} he came back and back again to embrace me and his child.|$|R
6000|$|On this {{particular}} day I was soundly rated. [...] "The obstinacy of my whole sex," [...] it seems, was concentrated in me; I had an [...] "orgueil de diable." [...] I feared to fail, forsooth! What did it matter whether I failed or not? Who was I that I should not fail, like my betters? It would do me good to fail. He {{wanted to see me}} worsted (<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did),</b> and one minute he paused to take breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "He DID {{feel the}} same, Elinor--for {{weeks and weeks}} he felt it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the blackest art {{employed}} against me can have done it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton? The morning that we parted too! When {{he told me that}} it might be many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Judith Pacewalk," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "was Matthias Butterwood's cousin. Before Matthias got {{rich and}} built this house, {{he lived with}} his Aunt Pacewalk on her farm. That was over at Pascalville, about thirty miles from here. He superintended the farm, and Judith and he were very good friends, {{although}} he never showed any signs of caring anything for her except {{in the way of a}} cousin; but she cared for him. There was no doubt about that. I lived in Pascalville, then, and used to be a great deal at their house, and it was as plain as daylight to me that Judith was in love with her cousin, although she was such a quiet girl that few people suspected it, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'French kid, my dear'--Philadelphia {{patted her}} shoulder--'and morone satin {{shoes and a}} morone and gold crape fan. That {{restored}} my calm. Nice things always do. I wore my hair banded on my forehead with a little curl over the left ear. And when I descended the stairs, en grande tenue, old Amoore curtsied to me without my having to stop and look at her, which, alas! is too often the case. Sir Arthur highly approved of the dinner, my dear: the mackerel did come in time. We had all the Marklake silver out, and he toasted my health, {{and he asked me}} where my little bird's-nesting sister was. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it to quiz me, so I looked him straight in the face, my dear, and I said, [...] "I always send her to the nursery, Sir Arthur, when I receive guests at Marklake Hall."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> it. <b>I</b> dread to go back--I admit that. I suppose Mr. Pratt {{is a good}} man, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> a {{great deal}} for the faith, and he is very generous to us, but oh, he is so vulgar, so impertinent! He bores me nearly frantic by being always at my elbow. I shudder when he touches me as if he were some sort of evil animal. Mother can't realize how he annoys and {{depresses}} me, and Anthony insists that we must endure it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who--I, my lady? {{what could}} <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> Only <b>he</b> <b>do</b> look {{to me like}} the same man, and so I thought it right to say to your ladyship." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dan and {{the girls}} and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivia's garden fence, {{watching}} Felix weed. Felix worked well, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like weeding--"fat boys never do," [...] Felicity informed him. Felix pretended not to hear her, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> because his ears grew red. Felix's face never blushed, but his ears always gave him away. As for Felicity, she did not {{say things like that}} out of malice prepense. It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat.|$|R
