40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} problem of {{designing}} a generalized system for building institutional repositories. Widely used schemes such as DSpace are tailored to {{a particular set of}} requirements: fixed metadata set; standard view when searching and browsing; pre-determined sequence for depositing items; built-in workflow for vetting new items. In contrast, Fedora builds in flexibility: institutional repositories are just one possible instantiation—however generality incurs a high overhead and uptake has been sluggish. This paper shows how existing components of the Greenstone software can be repurposed to provide a generalized institutional repository that <b>falls</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> extremes. ...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} organization of secondary educational systems is whether and at what age students should be allocated to academic and vocational tracks. As reported by Brunello and Checchi 2007, countries differ in the age at which students are tracked into different types (or levels) of education. While in the US and Scandinavia secondary schools are broadly comprehensive, in Austria and Germany pupils are tracked into different types of schools as early as at age 10. Many European countries <b>fall</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two extremes. There is also variety across countries in the number of available tracks.|$|R
50|$|Humans see {{differently}} {{at different}} light levels. This is because under high light levels typical {{during the day}} (photopic vision), the eye uses cones to process light. Under very low light levels, corresponding to moonless nights without electric lighting (scotopic vision), the eye uses rods to process light. At many night-time levels, {{a combination of both}} cones and rods supports vision. Photopic vision facilitates excellent color discrimination ability, whereas colors are indiscriminable under scotopic vision. Mesopic vision <b>falls</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two extremes. In most night-time environments, there is enough ambient light at night to prevent true scotopic vision.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerfect Graphs {{were defined}} by Claude Berge in 1961. Since that time {{this class of}} graphs has been {{intensely}} studied. Much of the work has been directed towards proving Berge's Strong and Weak Perfect Graph Conjectures. L. Lovász finally demonstrated the Weak Perfect Graph Conjecture in 1972. Vaśek Chvátal, in 1982, proposed the Semi-Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture which <b>falls</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two conjectures.

40|$|We {{examine the}} spatial scale of {{variability}} in recruitment for 11 marine, three anadromous, and five freshwater species. Generally the spatial scale of recruitment correlations for marine species is approximately 500 km, compared {{with less than}} 50 km for freshwater; anadromous species <b>fall</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two scales. The scale for marine species is comparable with (but less than) that of the largest-scale environmental variables (and {{is compatible with the}} idea that large-scale environmental agents influence recruitment). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that predation is a more important factor in determining recruitment in freshwater {{than it is in the}} marine environment...|$|R
50|$|The cones {{respond to}} bright light and mediate {{high-resolution}} colour vision during daylight illumination (also called photopic vision). The rods are saturated at daylight levels and don't contribute to pattern vision. However, rods do respond {{to dim light}} and mediate lower-resolution, monochromatic vision under very low levels of illumination (called scotopic vision). The illumination in most office settings <b>falls</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> two levels and is called mesopic vision. At these light levels, both the rods and cones are actively contributing pattern information to that exiting the eye. What contribution the rod information makes to pattern vision under these circumstances is unclear.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{an octave}} can be {{described}} as a major seventh augmented by a diatonic semitone, the augmented seventh is the sum of an octave, plus the difference between the chromatic and diatonic semitones, which makes it a highly variable quantity between one meantone tuning and the next. In standard equal temperament, in fact, it is identical to the perfect octave (...) , because both semitones have the same size. In 19 equal temperament, on the other hand, the interval is 63 cents short of an octave, i.e. 1137 cents. More typical meantone tunings <b>fall</b> <b>between</b> <b>these</b> extremes, giving it an intermediate size.|$|R
