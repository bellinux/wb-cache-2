Stroške konvencionalnega sušenja smo izračunali s CAE računalniškim modelom, stroške kondenzacijskega sušenja pa smo ocenili z analizo konkretno izvedenega postopka. Izračun smo naredili na primeru sušenja bukovega lesa (Fagus Sylvatica L.), debeline 50 mm. Z oceno in primerjavo stroškov smo predvideli lesno vlažnost, pri kateri je prehod med obema postopkoma sušenja optimalen. Ugotovili smo prednosti začetnega sušenja svežega lesa po kondenzacijskem načinu in nato dosušitev do končne vlažnosti po konvencionalnem postopku. Optimalni prehod med obema načinoma sušenja smo dosegli pri lesni vlažnosti 35, 1 %. Večjih prihrankov s kombiniranjem sušenja nismo potrdili, vzrok pa je velika razlika med cenama električne in toplotne energije.

A chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-synthesized graphene film is <b>dry</b> <b>transferred</b> by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to cover the microfiber on MgF 2 substrate, as is shown in Figure  7 a. In the substrate-supported structure, the substrate should have a low refractive index to guarantee the total reflection. Pump light (1, 060  nm) and carrier (signal) light (1, 550  nm) together transmit through the microfiber and the intensity of carrier light varied with pump light, as is shown in Figure  7 b,c,d. In this work, a modulation speed of only 1  MHz is achieved due to the low switching frequency of pump light. A modulation depth of approximately 5  dB is achieved by single-layer graphene. And as is expected, a higher modulation depth of approximately 13  dB is achieved by double-layer graphene.|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} through {{clothing is}} an important topic related to thermal comfort in environmental engineering and functional clothing design. The total heat transmitted through clothing is commonly considered as {{the sum of the}} <b>dry</b> heat <b>transfer</b> and the evaporative heat transfer. Clothing thermal insulation measured in a nonperspiring con dition, e. g., on a dry thermal manikin, is frequently used to calculate the <b>dry</b> heat <b>transfer</b> when the body is perspiring or even sweating heavily. The effect of perspiration on clothing thermal insulation with respect to <b>dry</b> heat <b>transfer</b> is not well understood, although it is widely speculated that perspiration reduces thermal insulation by wetting clothing assemblies. In this investigation, clothing thermal insulation with very low perspiration and very heavy perspiration is measured using a novel perspiring fabric thermal manikin. Clothing thermal insulation decreases during perspiration, and the amount of reduction varies from 2 to 8 %, as related to water accumulation within clothing ensembles. This finding suggests the "after chill" effect of wearers after heavy exercise may not only be caused by heat absorption due to the desorption and evaporation of water within clothing, but also to reduced clothing thermal insulation. Also, for clothing that can absorb a large amount of moisture during sweating, clothing thermal insulation measured on dry manikins may need to be corrected when used for calculating dry heat loss (sometimes used for calculating moisture vapor resistance) on a sweating manikin and predicting thermal comfort during sweating.

A constant-drying-rate-like period occurred when the moisture content of the droplet was higher than an amount of about 1. 0 kg kg(- 1) dry solid. The diameter of the droplet decreased sharply due to the evaporation of water, while its temperature remained at a wet-bulb-like temperature in this period. When the moisture content of the droplet was lower than the above-mentioned value, the <b>drying</b> <b>transferred</b> to a falling-drying-rate-period, during which the temperature of the droplet rose quickly and approached the air temperature as drying continued.
