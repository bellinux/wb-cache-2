Several studies demonstrate equivalent levels of impairment from both sleepy and drink driving. Yet, drivers perceive sleepy and drink driving distinctly different, with {{younger and older}} drivers engaging in these two risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> at different rates. The current study sought to examine the sleepy and drink <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> and perceptions {{in a sample of}} 114 younger (17 - 29 years) and 177 older (30 + years) drivers. Compared to older drivers, younger drivers reported more positive attitudes toward sleepy and drink <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as well as more negative views regarding perceived legitimacy of sleepy driving enforcement. Younger drivers {{were also more likely to}} report performing sleepy <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> than older drivers. Younger drivers reported greater likelihood to drive while sleepy, lower perceptions of legitimacy for sleepy driving, and more positive attitudes towards sleepy driving when compared to drink driving and the same pattern was found for older drivers as well. Subsequently, the self-reported likelihood of driving while sleepy was greater than drink driving in both age groups. Overall, the results suggest that sleepy driving is not viewed as equally dangerous as drink driving with younger drivers’ perceptions being more lenient than older drivers’ perceptions. It is likely that change is needed regarding the perceptions of dangerousness of sleepy driving with a particular focus on younger drivers seemingly needed...|$|R

Methods: 1268 drivers (373 males) aged 17 - 26 years were surveyed regarding their sociodemographics (age, gender) and self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> including crashes, offences, Policeavoidance, and driving intentions. Results: A relatively small proportion of participants reported driving after taking drugs (5. 9 % males, 1. 3 % females) and drinking alcohol (19. 3 % males, 11. 6 % females). In comparison, a considerable proportion of participants reported at least occasionally exceeding speed limits (85. 7 % novices) and driving when tired (82. 7 % novices). Substance-impaired driving was associated with avoiding Police, speeding, risky driving intentions, and self reported crashes and offences. Forty-four percent of illicit-drug drivers also reported alcohol-impaired driving. Discussion and conclusions: The low self-reported prevalence of substance-impaired driving suggests official enforcement measures play a role in promoting compliance, in addition to social influences such as the broader community and the young novice drivers’ social networks including friends and family. Conversely, the prevalence of speeding appears to reflect the pervasive cultural acceptance of this behaviour.

40|$|Road {{trauma is}} {{recognized}} as a major public health problem worldwide (particularly for younger drivers), and risky driving {{has been identified as}} an important contributor to road crashes. It is often assumed that similar factors influence all risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours,</b> although direct and systematic examination of the differences between risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> in terms of precipitating factors is lacking. The present thesis sought to undertake a systematic investigation of relevant factors in the prediction of four key risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> (speeding, drink-driving, <b>driving</b> while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts). Four versions of a Risky Driving Questionnaire were developed to assess beliefs, personality factors and behavioural intentions, in relation to each of the four behaviours. Four versions of the Implicit Association Test were developed to assess attitudes toward each of the four behaviours, without reliance on self-report (in terms of the relative strength of pairs of associations). Data were collected from a student sample (N= 215 : Study 1), as well as urban (N= 587) and rural (N= 422) general population samples (Study 2), and regression models were examined {{for each of the four}} behaviours, with interaction terms to assess moderations involving perceived risk. Mediations involving gender were also assessed. Results indicate that different risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> are predicted by different factors. For example, in the urban sample, speeding was predicted by driver anger and illusory invulnerability, drink driving was predicted by peer influence, driving while fatigued was predicted by the perceived benefits of not driving while fatigued, and not wearing seat belts was predicted by the (sensation seeking x illusory invulnerability) interaction. Results also suggest that different predictors of risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> are relevant for different driver populations. For example, speeding was predicted by authority rebellion in the urban sample, and by sensation seeking in the rural sample. Observed moderations of perceived risk suggest that relationships between perceived risk and risky driving may differ for males versus females, and for low versus high sensation seekers. Findings suggest that future road safety interventions should be based on research of the determinants of individual risky <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and in specific driver populations...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) was {{employed}} in an Australian fleet setting {{to examine the}} self-reported <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{of a group of}} professional drivers (N = 4792). Participants agreed to complete surveys advertised through the internal mail system. Analysis of the DBQ revealed a three factor solution with two of these factors consisting of a combination of both aggression and highway code violations from the original DBQ.

Logistic regression analysis revealed that, of the traditional DBQ factors, driving errors was the only significant predictor of self-reported crashes after controlling for driving exposure.

40|$|The {{social cost}} of road injury and {{fatalities}} is still unacceptable. The driver is often mainly responsible for road crashes, therefore changing the driver behaviour {{is one of}} the most important and most challenging priority in road transport. This paper presents three innovative visions that articulate the potential of using Vehicle to Vehicle (V 2 V) communication for supporting the exchange of social information amongst drivers. We argue that there could be tremendous benefits in socialising cars to influence human <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours</b> for the better and that this aspect is still relevant in the age of looming autonomous cars. Our visions provide theoretical grounding how V 2 V infrastructure and emerging human–machine interfaces (HMI) could persuade drivers to: (i) adopt better (e. g. greener) driving practices, (ii) reduce drivers aggressiveness towards pro-social <b>driving</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and (iii) reduce risk-taking behaviour in young, particularly male, adults. The visions present simple but powerful concepts that reveal ‘good’ aspects of the driver behaviour to other drivers and make them contagious.
