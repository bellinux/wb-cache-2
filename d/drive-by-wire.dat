25|$|The {{engines are}} {{aluminium}} alloy units, with advanced torque-based engine management system, <b>drive-by-wire</b> throttle control, and variable camshaft phasing (on the 4.4-litre version).|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} {{included a}} <b>drive-by-wire</b> electronic throttle, a five-speed automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist {{as well as}} electronic stability and traction control systems. The fourth-generation Lexus ES was built in Kyūshū and Toyota, Aichi, Japan.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, the 2005 {{model was}} also changed. A major change {{included}} a <b>drive-by-wire</b> throttle for all CR-Vs. The all-wheel drive system was improved; {{it had been}} tuned to activate faster in low traction situations. US market models were equipped with a five-speed automatic, {{as opposed to the}} previous four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|For {{the model}} year 2000, a new 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission with adaptive shift logic was introduced. It was only available on non turbo front-wheel drive models and the 2000 V70 R AWD. All 10V engines were dropped {{and replaced by}} detuned 20V versions. <b>Drive-by-wire</b> throttle was now also introduced for non turbo models.|$|E
25|$|The C5 {{was also}} the first Corvette to {{incorporate}} a <b>drive-by-wire</b> throttle; and variable-effort steering, whereby the assist level of the power steering is varied according to vehicle speed (more at lower speeds, less at higher speeds). Also notable, though rarely discussed, the C5 generation was the first model to adopt the parallel or 'tandem' windshield wiper configuration, abandoning the opposed configuration that was used on every previous Corvette model since the first in 1953.|$|E
25|$|The Caterham is {{the purest}} and most honest street car I've ever driven. Period. No power steering. No power brakes. No <b>drive-by-wire.</b> Just a direct {{connection}} {{between you and the}} contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. And I can see exactly what's happening, at least at {{the front end of the}} car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} allow the {{powertrain}} computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight’s accelerator pedal is a “drive-by-wire” type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine’s throttle body. In the <b>drive-by-wire</b> system, the engine’s throttle body {{is controlled by the}} powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position—allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.|$|E
25|$|The LF-C is {{a concept}} car Lexus {{unveiled}} at the 2004 New York Auto Show. This concept featured a retractable hardtop design which allowed for coupe, convertible, targa, or speedster configurations via a four-position glass roof. The designation stands for Lexus Future-Coupe. The LF-C is fitted with a V8 engine and rear-wheel drive. Unique features included a one-touch activation button, crystal LED taillamps, suede bucket seats, a 3D instrument panel, <b>drive-by-wire,</b> and a translucent crystal center console with blue backlighting. The LF-C also featured retractable rear-view cameras in place of side mirrors on the doors and rear bumper.|$|E
25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced dual stage frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation side airbag which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New engine management systems with <b>drive-by-wire</b> throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Holden Monaro from Australia) took place, {{effectively}} {{replacing the}} spot {{left by the}} Firebird and Camaro. The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in 2004. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Its clean lines and understated looks drew some criticism. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. Initial dealer mark ups, slow shipping transit from Australia, and lack of advertisement by GM were to blame. Due to the retirement of the LS1 engine in 2004, Pontiac added the <b>drive-by-wire</b> 400 HP LS2 V8 for 2005–2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance, and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced {{as well as a}} Competition Group package (Comp G).|$|E
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a <b>drive-by-wire</b> electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E
