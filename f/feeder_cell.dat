50|$|LIF {{is often}} added to stem cell culture media as an {{alternative}} to <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> culture, due to the limitation that feeder cells present by only producing LIF on their cell surfaces. Feeder cells lacking the lif gene do not effectively support stem cells. LIF promotes self-renewal by recruiting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Stat3 is recruited to the activated LIF receptor and phosphorylated by Janus Kinase. It bears noting that LIF and Stat3 are not sufficient to inhibit stem cell differentiation, as cells will differentiate upon removal of serum. During the reversibility phase of differentiation from naive pluripotency, it is possible to revert cells back to naive pluripotency through the addition of LIF.Removal of LIF pushes stem cells toward differentiation, however genetic manipulation of embryonic stem cells allows for LIF independent growth, notably overexpression of the gene Nanog.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability to}} rapidly {{generate}} many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands {{the value of}} biobanking. Using CRC technology, researchers {{were able to identify}} an effective therapy for a patient with a rare type of lung tumor. Engleman's group describes a pharmacogenomic platform that facilitates rapid discovery of drug combinations that can overcome resistance using CRC system. In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host. While initial studies revealed that co-culturing epithelial cells with Swiss 3T3 cells J2 was essential for CRC induction, with transwell culture plates, physical contact between feeders and epithelial cells is not required for inducing CRCs and more importantly that irradiation of the feeder cells is required for this induction. Consistent with the transwell experiments, conditioned medium induces and maintains CRCs, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase of cellular telomerase activity. The activity of the conditioned medium correlates directly with radiation-induced <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{embryonic}} and {{adult stem cell}} lines require an initial co-culturing with feeder cells for non-differentiated growth, self renewal and maintenance of pluripotency. However for many downstream ES cell applications the feeder cells {{have to be considered}} contaminations that might interfere not just with the analysis of experimental data but also with clinical application and tissue engineering approaches. Here we introduce a novel technique that allows for the selection of pure feeder-freed stem cells, following stem cell proliferation on <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> layers. Complete and reproducible separation of feeder and embryonic stem cells was accomplished by adaptation of an automated cell selection system that resulted in the aspiration of distinct cell colonies or fraction of colonies according to predefined physical parameters. Analyzing neuronal differentiation we demonstrated feeder-freed stem cells to exhibit differentiation potentials comparable to embryonic stem cells differentiated under standard conditions. However, embryoid body growth as well as differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes was significantly enhanced in feeder-freed cells, indicating a <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> dependent modulation of lineage differentiation during early embryoid body development. These findings underline the necessity to separate stem and feeder cells before the initiation of in vitro differentiation. The complete separation of stem and feeder cells by this new technology results in pure stem cell populations for translational approaches.

The objec-tive {{of this study was}} to evaluate the survival and proliferation of frozen-thawed bovine spermatogonial stem cells in vitro and investigate the effects of exogenous glial cell line-derived neu-rotrophic factor (GDNF). In order to accomplish this objective we developed a bovine embryonic fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> line, termed BEF, to serve as feeder cells in a coculture system with bovine germ cells. Bovine spermatogonial stem cell survival and proliferation in vitro were evaluated by xenogeneic transplan-tation into the seminiferous tubules of immunodeficient mice.

Since the first derivation of hESCs in 1998, a variety of culture conditions have been described for the undifferentiated growth of hPSCs. In this study, we cultured both hESCs and hiPSCs in three different culture conditions: on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and SNL <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> layers together with conventional stem cell culture medium containing knockout serum replacement and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), as well as on a Matrigel matrix in mTeSR 1 medium. hPSC lines were subjected to cardiac differentiation in mouse visceral endodermal-like (END- 2) co-cultures and the cardiac differentiation efficiency was determined by counting both the beating areas and Troponin T positive cells, as well as studying the expression of OCT- 3 / 4, mesodermal Brachyury T and NKX 2. 5 and endodermal SOX- 17 at various time points during END- 2 differentiation by q-RT-PCR analysis.

Current viral vectors are efficient at introducing transgenic sequences but result in random integrations. Gene targeting, in contrast, can directly correct an affected gene, or incorporate corrective sequences into a site free from undesirable side effects, but efficiency is low. Most current targeting procedures, consequently, use positive-negative selection with drugs, often requiring ≥ 10 days. This drug selection causes problems with stem cells that differentiate in this time or require <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> because the <b>feeders</b> must be drug resistant and so are not eliminated by the selection.

In regard to stem cell expansion, gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought {{to play an important}} role in hESC survival and differentiation.

40|$|In general, human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) and human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSCs) (1) can be cultured under variable conditions. However, {{it is not easy to}} establish an effective system for culturing these cells. Since the culture conditions can influence gene expression that confers pluripotency in hESCs and hiPSCs, the optimization and standardization of the culture method is crucial. The establishment of hESC lines was first described by using MEFs as <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> and fetal bovine serum (FBS) -containing culture medium(2). Next, FBS was replaced with knockout serum replacement (KSR) and FGF 2, which enhances proliferation of hESCs(3). Finally, feeder-free culture systems enable culturing cells on Matrigel-coated plates in KSR-containing conditioned medium (medium conditioned by MEFs) (4). Subsequently, hESCs culture conditions have moved towards feeder-free culture in chemically defined conditions(5 - 7). Moreover, to avoid the potential contamination by pathogens and animal proteins culture methods using xeno-free components have been established(8). To obtain improved conditions mouse <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> have been replaced with human cell lines (e. g. fetal muscle and skin cells(9), adult skin cells(10), foreskin fibroblasts(11 - 12), amniotic mesenchymal cells(13)). However, the efficiency of maintaining undifferentiated hESCs using human foreskin fibroblast-derived feeder layers is not as high as that from mouse <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> due to the lower level of secretion of Activin A(14). Obviously, there is an evident difference in growth factor production by mouse and human <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> Analyses of the transcriptomes of mouse and human <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> revealed significant differences between supportive and non-supportive cells. Exogenous FGF 2 is crucial for maintaining self-renewal of hESCs and hiPSCs, and has been identified as a key factor regulating the expression of Tgfbeta 1, Activin A and Gremlin (a BMP antagonist) in <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> Activin A has been shown to induce the expression of OCT 4, SOX 2, and NANOG in hESCs(15 - 16). For long-term culture, hESCs and hiPSCs can be grown on mitotically inactivated MEFs or under feeder-free conditions in MEF-CM (MEF-Conditioned Medium) on Matrigel-coated plates to maintain their undifferentiated state. Success of both culture conditions fully depends on the quality of the <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> since they directly affect the growth of hESCs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Feeder {{cells are}} {{frequently}} {{used for the}} early-stage of derivation and culture of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines. METHODS: We established a conditionally immortalized human foreskin fibroblast line that secreted {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF). These cells were used as feeder cells for hESC culture and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell derivation and expansion. This conditional immortalization was performed using lentiviral vector (LV) mediated transduction of Bmi- 1 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase genes and the resulting cell line was further modified by LV-mediated transduction of a secreted form of bFGF gene product. Three different laboratories have tested whether this <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> line could support the maintenance of four different hESC lines. RESULTS: Immortalized fibroblasts secreting stable amounts of bFGF supported the growth of all hESC lines, which remained pluripotent and had a normal karyotype for at least 10 passages. Even at high passage (p 56), these modified cells, when used as feeders, could support iPS derivation and propagation. Derived iPS cells expressed pluripotency markers, had hESC morphology and produced tissue components of the three germ layers when differentiated in vitro.

40|$|AbstractFibroblast feeder cells play an {{important}} role in supporting the derivation and long term culture of undifferentiated, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The feeder cells secrete various growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins into extracellular milieu. However, the roles of the feeder cell-secreted factors are largely unclear. Animal feeder cells and use of animal serum also make current <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> culture conditions unsuitable for derivation of clinical grade hESCs. We established xeno-free <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> lines using human serum (HS) and studied their function in hESC culture. While human foreskin fibroblast (hFF) feeder cells were clearly hESC supportive, none of the established xeno-free human dermal fibroblast (hDF) feeder cells were able to maintain undifferentiated hESC growth. The two fibroblast types were compared for their ECM protein synthesis, integrin receptor expression profiles and key growth factor secretion. We show that hESC supportive feeder cells produce laminin- 511 and express laminin-binding integrins α 3 ß 1, α 6 ß 1 and α 7 ß 1. These results indicate specific laminin isoforms and integrins in maintenance of hESC pluripotency in feeder-dependent cultures.

40|$|The limbal {{stem cell}} {{population}} {{is located in}} the limbal junctional zone between the cornea and the conjunctiva, and is responsible for maintaining the corneal epithelium. Damage to the limbal stem cell population results in a condition known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), which is characterised by conjunctivalisation of the cornea, visual impairment and persistent irritation. To treat LSCD, an alternative source of human limbal epithelial (HLE) cells must be transplanted back onto the diseased cornea. Limbal tissue grafts have had a moderate degree of success. However, autologous grafts risk damage to the healthy eye, whilst allogeneic grafts are susceptible to immunological rejection. Cultured HLE grafts offer a promising alternative to whole tissue grafts. The production of cultured HLE grafts involves the removal of a small (1 - 2 mm 2) biopsy from the patient's healthy limbus, followed by ex vivo expansion to produce an epithelial sheet, which is subsequently transplanted onto the damaged corneal surface. However, the production of cultured HLE grafts usually requires the addition of animal-derived products during cell culture. Animal-derived components, such as foetal bovine serum (FBS) and murine 3 T 3 <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> introduce the patient to potential crossspecies infection and immune responses to xenogeneic antigens. Consequently, the overall aim of this project has been to develop a culture technique free of xenogeneic products for the establishment and propagation of HLE cells. To achieve this aim, alternatives to FBS in the culture medium and 3 T 3 <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> were pursued. A defined serum-free medium (SFM) containing vitronectin (VN), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was investigated as an alternative to serumsupplemented medium (SSM) for HLE cell culture. Initial studies focused on the effects of these growth factors on HLE cell metabolic activity and migration. Metabolic activity was primarily stimulated by IGF-I and EGF, with the combination of IGF-I and EGF in solution stimulating metabolic activity to a significantly greater extent than the SSM positive control (p = 0. 006). HLE cell migration was also effected by combinations of VN, IGFBP 3, IGF-I and EGF. Migration was stimulated above the SFM negative control by the combination of IGFBP 3 and IGF-I either with or without the addition of EGF. However, the presence of VN was required for optimal migratory responses (p < 0. 003). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) were also investigated as additional components to the SFM formulation. HGF significantly stimulated HLE cell metabolic activity and migration (p < 0. 02). In contrast, KGF did not significantly stimulate either HLE cell metabolic activity or migration. The addition of either HGF or KGF to the SFM supplemented with VN, IGFBP 3, IGF-I and EGF did not significantly enhance the metabolic activity of HLE cells. Therefore, HGF and KGF were no longer pursued as additional components to the SFM formulation. Additional studies were conducted to examine the efficacy of replacing murine 3 T 3 <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> with human ocular stromal cells during HLE cell culture. Initially, stromal cells were isolated from the cornea, limbus and sclera to determine whether there were differences between these stromal cell populations. The results indicated that scleral stromal cells had a significantly larger area and perimeter than either corneal or limbal stromal cells (p < 0. 001). Scleral stromal cells were also significantly more rounded than either corneal or limbal stromal cells, as determined by the elliptical factor equation (p < 0. 001). Immunocytochemistry also revealed that scleral stromal cells expressed significantly more of the myofibroblast marker a- smooth muscle actin than either corneal or limbal stromal cells (p < 0. 001), and significantly less of the fibroblast/myofibroblast marker Thy- 1 than corneal or limbal stromal cells (p < 0. 001). Therefore, scleral stromal cells were identified as different in comparison to corneal and limbal stromal cells. Primary HLE cells were cultured with irradiated corneal, limbal and scleral stromal cells. HLE cultures established with either corneal or limbal stromal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> contained more cellular protein (as measured by rhodamine B dye absorbance) than cultures established without <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> (p < 0. 001). The colony forming efficiency (CFE) of HLE cells established with corneal or limbal stromal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> was also significantly greater than HLE <b>cells</b> established without <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> (p < 0. 001). In contrast, HLE cultures established with scleral stromal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> contained low levels of cellular protein and had a low CFE, which was not significantly different to the HLE cultures established without <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunocytochemistry indicated that HLE cultures established with scleral <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> also showed lower expression of the stem cell markers ABCG 2 and C/EBP. These results suggest that freshly isolated HLE cells can be cultured with irradiated corneal or limbal stromal cells as a replacement for murine 3 T 3 <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, the SFM supplemented with VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF was combined with limbal stromal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> and examined as a culture technique free of animalderived products. Freshly isolated HLE cells established in SFM supplemented with VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF and limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> contained a similar amount of cellular protein (as measured by crystal violet dye absorbance) when compared to the SSM+ 3 T 3 positive control. In addition, the CFE of freshly isolated HLE cells established in VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF and limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> was significantly higher than the SSM+ 3 T 3 positive control (p = 0. 004). However, a live/dead assay revealed a reduced HLE cell viability in SFM supplemented with VN+IGFBP 3 +IGFI+ EGF and limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> after seven days in culture. In addition, immunocytochemistry demonstrated a lower expression of the stem cell markers ABCG 2 and C/EBP in the SFM treatment with limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, freshly isolated HLE cells can be cultured in SFM supplemented with VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF and limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> However, this culture technique is less likely to support the growth of immature limbal stem cells when compared to the SSM+ 3 T 3 positive control. Overall, this research has attempted to create a culture system free of animal-derived products for the production of cultured HLE grafts to treat limbal stem cell deficiency. The results show that HLE cells respond to a serum-free medium formulation containing VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF. In addition, this culture medium can be combined with irradiated stromal cells isolated from the limbus to support HLE culture production. However, the combination of VN+IGFBP 3 +IGF-I+EGF and limbal <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> demonstrated a reduced viability, which indicates that further refinement of the formulation is required. This thesis has also demonstrated differences between stromal cells isolated from the cornea, limbus, and sclera, and has generated knowledge which may impact on the understanding of stromalepithelial regulation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{introduce}} a non-contact approach to microprint multiple types of <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> in a microarray format using immiscible aqueous solutions of two biopo-lymers. Droplets of cell suspension in the denser aqueous phase are printed on a substrate residing within a bath of the immersion aqueous phase. Due to their affinity to the denser phase, cells remain localized within the drops and adhere to {{regions of the}} substrate underneath the drops. We show the utility of this technology for creating duplex heterocellular stem cell niches by printing two different support cell types on a gel surface and overlaying them with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). As desired, the type of printed support cell spatially direct the fate of overlaid mESCs. Interestingly, we found that interspaced mESCs colonies on differentia-tion-inducing <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> show enhanced neuronal differ-entiation and give rise to dense networks of neurons. This cell printing technology provides unprecedented capabilities to efficiently identify the role of various <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> in guiding the fate of stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The rabbit is a {{classical}} experimental animal species. A major limitation in using rabbits for biomedical {{research is the}} lack of germ-line-competent rabbit embryonic stem cells (rbESCs). We hypothesized that the use of homologous <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> and recombinant rabbit leukemia inhibitory factor (rbLIF) might improve the chance in deriving germ-line-competent rbES cells. In the present study, we established rabbit embryonic fibroblast (REF) feeder layers and synthesized recombinant rbLIF. We derived a total of seven putative rbESC lines, of which two lines (M 5 and M 23) were from culture Condition I using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as feeders supplemented with human LIF (hLIF) (MEF+hLIF). Another five lines (R 4, R 9, R 15, R 21, and R 31) were derived from Condition II using REFs as <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> supplemented with rbLIF (REF+rbLIF). Similar derivation efficiency was observed between these two conditions (8. 7 % vs. 10. 2 %). In a separate experiment with 2 ? 3 factorial design, we examined the effects of <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> (MEF vs. REF) and LIFs (mLIF, hLIF vs. rbLIF) on rbESC culture. Both Conditions I and II supported satisfactory rbESC culture, with similar or better population doubling time and colony-forming efficiency than other combinations of <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> with LIFs. Rabbit ESCs derived and maintained on both conditions displayed typical ESC characteristics, including ESC pluripotency marker expression (AP, Oct 4, Sox 2, Nanog, and SSEA 4) and gene expression (Oct 4, Sox 2, Nanog, c-Myc, Klf 4, and Dppa 5), and the capacity to differentiate into three primary germ layers in vitro. The present work is the first attempt to establish rbESC lines using homologous <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> and recombinant rbLIF, by which the rbESCs were derived and maintained normally. These cell lines are unique resources and may facilitate the derivation of germ-line-competent rbESCs...|$|R
40|$|Zebrafish female {{germline}} {{stem cell}} (FGSC) cultures were generated from a transgenic line of fish that expresses Neo and DsRed {{under the control}} of the germ cell specific promoter, ziwi [Tg(ziwi:neo);Tg(ziwi:DsRed) ]. Homogeneous FGSC cultures were established by G 418 selection and continued to express ziwi for more than 6 weeks along with the germ cell markers nanos 3, dnd, dazl and vasa. A key component of the cell culture system was the use of a <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> line that was initiated from ovaries of a transgenic line of fish [Tg(gsdf:neo) ] that expresses Neo controlled by the zebrafish gonadal soma derived factor (gsdf) promoter. The <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> line was selected in G 418 and engineered to express zebrafish leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf 2) and glial-cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf). These factors were shown to significantly enhance FGSC growth, survival and germline competency in culture. Results from cell transplantation experiments revealed that the cultured FGSCs were able to successfully colonize the gonad of sterile recipient fish and generate functional gametes. Up to 20 % of surviving recipient fish that were injected with the cultured FGSCs were fertile and generated multiple batches of normal offspring for at least 6 months. The FGSC cultures will provide an in vitro system for studies of zebrafish germ cell growth and differentiation and their high frequency of germline transmission following transplantation could form the basis of a stem cell-mediated strategy for gene transfer and manipulation of the zebrafish genome...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} reports of defined culture {{systems for the}} {{propagation}} of human embryonic stem cells {{in the absence of}} <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> support, but no previous study has undertaken a multi-laboratory comparison of these diverse methodologies. In this study, five separate laboratories, each with experience in human embryonic stem cell culture, used a panel of ten embryonic stem cell lines (including WA 09 as an index cell line common to all laboratories) to assess eight cell culture methods, with propagation in the presence of Knockout Serum Replacer, FGF- 2, and mouse embryonic fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cell</b> layers serving as a positive control. The cultures were assessed for up to ten passages for attachment, death, and differentiated morphology by phase contrast microscopy, for growth by serial cell counts, and for maintenance of stem cell surface marker expression by flow cytometry. Of the eight culture systems, only the control and those based on two commercial media, mTeSR 1 and STEMPRO, supported maintenance of most cell lines for ten passages. Cultures grown in the remaining media failed before this point due to lack of attachment, cell death, or overt cell differentiation. Possible explanations for relative success of the commercial formulations in this study, and the lack of success with other formulations from academic groups compared to previously published results, include: the complex combination of growth factors present in the commercial preparations; improved development, manufacture, and quality control in the commercial products; differences in epigenetic adaptation to culture in vitro between different ES cell lines grown in different laboratories...|$|E

Voltage regulation, one of Active Network's services, is then presented. The autonomous voltage control within each <b>feeder</b> (<b>Cell)</b> can be deployed {{by a combination of}} active and reactive power supports of distributed generators (DG). The coordination voltage control defines the optimal tap setting of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) while comparing amounts of control actions in each Cell. The test results show that the voltage regulation in Active Network can help to integrate more DGs and mitigate voltage violation effectively. The optimal solution can be reached within a small number of calculation iterations...|$|E
40|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (hPSC) differentiated to retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) provide a promising tool for cell replacement therapies of retinal degenerative diseases. The in vitro differentiation of hPSC-RPE is still poorly understood and current differentiation protocols rely on spontaneous differentiation on fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> or as floating cell aggregates in suspension. The fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> may have an inductive effect on the hPSC-RPE differentiation, providing variable signals mimicking the extraocular mesenchyme that directs the differentiation in vivo. The effect of the commonly used fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> on the hPSCRPE differentiation was studied by comparing suspension differentiation in standard RPEbasic (no bFGF) medium to RPEbasic medium conditioned with mouse embryonic (mEF-CM) and human foreskin (hFF-CM) fibroblast <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> The fibroblast secreted factors were found to enhance early hPSC-RPE differentiation. The onset of pigmentation was faster in the conditioned media (CM) compared to RPEbasic for both human embryonic (hESC) and induced pluripotent (iPSC) stem cells, with the first pigments appearing around two weeks of differentiation. After four weeks of differentiation, CM conditions consistently contained higher number of pigmented cell aggregates. The ratio of PAX 6 and MITF positive cells was quantified to be clearly higher in the CM conditions, with mEFCM containing most positive cells. The mEF cells were found to secrete low levels of activin A growth factor that is known to regulate eye field differentiation. As RPEbasic was supplemented with corresponding, low level (10 ng/ml) of recombinant human activin A, a clear increase in the hPSC-RPE differentiation was achieved. Thus, inductive effect provided by <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> was at least partially driven by activin A and could be substituted with {{a low level of}} recombinant growth factor in contrasts to previously reported much higher concentrations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Differentiated {{cells can}} be reprogrammed into pluripotency by {{transduction}} of four defined transcription factors. Induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPS cells) {{are expected to be}} useful for regenerative medicine as well as basic research. Recently, the report showed that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells are not essential for reprogramming. However, in using fibroblasts as donor cells for reprogramming, individual fibroblasts that had failed to reprogram could function as <b>feeder</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here, we show that adult mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), which are not functional <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> can be reprogrammed into iPS cells using defined four factors (Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and c-Myc) under feeder-free conditions. The iPS cells, generated from NSCs expressing the Oct 4 -GFP reporter gene, could proliferate for more than two months (passage 20). Generated and maintained without <b>feeder</b> <b>cells,</b> these iPS cells expressed pluripotency markers (Oct 4 and Nanog), the promoter regions of Oct 4 and Nanog were hypomethylated, could differentiated into to all three germ layers in vitro, and formed a germline chimera. These data indicate that NSCs can achieve and maintain pluripotency under feeder-free conditions. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggested that factors secreted by <b>feeder</b> <b>cells</b> are not essential in the initial/early stages of reprogramming and for pluripotency maintenance. This technology might be useful for a human system, as a feeder-free reprogramming system may help generate iPS cells of a clinical grade for tissue or organ regeneration...|$|R
