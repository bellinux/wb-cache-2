5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> Got Their Shapes is a US {{television}} series that aired on the History Channel. It is hosted by Brian Unger {{and is based}} on Mark Stein's book, <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> Got Their Shapes. The show deals with <b>how</b> <b>the</b> various <b>states</b> of <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> established their borders but also delves into other aspects of U.S. history, including failed states, proposed new <b>states,</b> and <b>the</b> local culture and character of various US states. It thus tackles the [...] "shapes" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> in a metaphorical sense as well as a literal sense.|$|R

25|$|Under the Democratic Party's Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention, delegates {{are awarded}} by {{proportional}} representation, {{with a minimum}} 15 percent threshold required to receive delegates.

Pataki started to hold open sessions with legislative leaders on budget issues, and including minority leaders of the Senate and Assembly in these discussions. In addition, he again encouraged the adoption of an ontime budget, and in 2005 and 2006 the state budget was adopted on time.|$|E

25|$|Lawmakers did {{not approve}} another {{initiative}} of Blagojevich's, FamilyCare (which would provide healthcare for families of four making up to $82,000), but Blagojevich attempted to implement the plan unilaterally by executive order. In rejecting Blagojevich's executive order, a legislative committee questioned <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{would pay for the}} program. Blagojevich's decision has been called unconstitutional by two courts, which nullified the plan. However, during October 2008, pharmacies which had followed Blagojevich's directive to dispense drugs under the plan were informed by his administration {{that they would not be}} reimbursed and would have payments given under the system deducted from future Medicaid payments. One state lawmaker, Republican Ron Stephens, suggested that Blagojevich should pay the difference out of his own personal account. The Pantagraph agreed with Stephens in an editorial.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{was convicted}} and sentenced to 50 years in prison. His {{conviction}} was subsequently upheld by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas's highest criminal court, in 1966.

2500|$|Gramsci is {{best known}} for his theory of {{cultural}} hegemony, which describes <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and ruling capitalist class – the bourgeoisie – use cultural institutions to maintain power in capitalist societies. The bourgeoisie in Gramsci's view develops a hegemonic culture using ideology rather than violence, economic force, or coercion. Hegemonic culture propagates its own values and norms so that they become the [...] "common sense" [...] values of all and thus maintain the status quo. Hegemonic power is therefore used to maintain consent to the capitalist order, rather than coercive power using force to maintain order. This cultural hegemony is produced and reproduced by the dominant class through the institutions that form the superstructure.|$|E
2500|$|Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began {{studying}} the state formation processes in Europe {{and elsewhere in}} the 17th century—beginning significantly with Max Weber. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> became prominent over particular societies. A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies. [...] The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about State-building. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.|$|E
