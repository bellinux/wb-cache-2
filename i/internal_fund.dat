60|$|The {{meeting at}} first was stiff and formal enough. But Edward, having {{accepted}} the invitation, {{and his mind}} being really soothed and relieved by the kindness of Morton, held himself bound to behave with ease, though he could not affect cordiality. The Major was somewhat of a bon vivant, and his wine was excellent. He told his old campaign stories, and displayed much knowledge of men and manners. Mr. Morton had an <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> of placid and quiet gaiety, which seldom failed to enliven any small party in which he found himself pleasantly seated. Waverley, whose life was a dream, gave ready way to the predominating impulse and became the most lively of the party. He had at all times remarkable natural powers of conversation, though easily silenced by discouragement. On the present occasion he piqued himself upon leaving {{on the minds of}} his companions a favourable impression of one who, under such disastrous circumstances, could sustain his misfortunes with ease and gaiety. His spirits, though not unyielding, were abundantly elastic, and soon seconded his efforts. The trio were engaged in very lively discourse, apparently delighted with each other, and the kind host was pressing a third bottle of Burgundy, when the sound of a drum was heard at some distance. The Major, who, in the glee of an old soldier, had forgot the duties of a magistrate, cursed, with a muttered military oath, the circumstances which recalled him to his official functions. He rose and went towards the window, which commanded a very near view of the highroad, and he was followed by his guests.|$|E

40|$|This Paper {{examines}} how {{the investment of}} financially constrained firms varies with their level of <b>internal</b> <b>funds.</b> We develop a theoretical model of optimal investment under financial constraints. Our model endogenizes the costs of external funds and allows for negative levels of <b>internal</b> <b>funds.</b> We show that the resulting relationship between <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> and investment is U-shaped. In particular, when a firm’s <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> are negative and sufficiently low, a further decrease leads {{to an increase in}} investment. This effect is driven by the investor’s participation constraint: when part of any loan must be used to close a financing gap, the investor will provide funds only if the firm invests at a scale large enough to generate the revenue that enables the firm to repay. We test our theory using a dataset with close to 100, 000 firm-year observations. The data strongly support our predictions. Among other results, we find a negative relationship between measures of <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> and investment for a substantial share of financially constrained firms.

Survey research design was adopted for the study. The population of the study was made up of 73 staff working in the Akwa Ibom State e-library. A total of 60 respondents were selected from the population as the sample for the study. The major instrument used for collection of data was the questionnaire designed by the researchers. The data collected were analysed using simple percentages. Results of analysis showed that: the Akwa Ibom State library Uyo makes use of information and communication technologies; there is fund allocation for the use of ICT in the library; there is no <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> raising mechanism for the development of ICT in the library; there is digital literacy program for the library. Based on the findings, it was recommended among others that: financial support should be granted by government/public library management, charity organizations/corporate bodies to public libraries so as to foster the role of ICTs in the provision of adequate library services; an <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> raising mechanism should be introduced for the maintenance of ICT equipment in the library...|$|E

40|$|Ample {{evidence}} {{points to}} a negative relation between <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> (profitability) {{and the demand for}} external funds (debt issuance). This relation has been interpreted as evidence supporting the pecking order theory. We show, however, that the negative effect of <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> on the demand for external financing is concentrated among firms that are least likely to face high external financing costs (firms that distribute large amounts of dividends, that are large, and whose debt is rated). For firms in {{the other end of the}} spectrum (low payout, small, and unrated), external financing is insensitive to <b>internal</b> <b>funds.</b> These cross-firm differences hold separately for debt and equity, and are magnified in the aftermath of macroeconomic movements that tighten financing constraints. We argue that the greater complementarity between <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> and external finance for constrained firms is a consequence of the interdependence of their financing and investment decisions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} issues of {{existing}} social enterprise acts and the possibility to have separate incorporation acts and legal framework for the revenue generating not-for-profit green social enterprises (NPRGSEs) and for the transforming green social enterprise microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Ontario. This agenda is very important and urgent in the cutback policy era in Ontario to reduce the dependence of green social enterprises on public resources {{as well as to}} develop alternative strategies for their <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> mobilization process. The separate Incorporation Acts for these NPRGSEs would allow them to establish partnerships among private and NPRGSEs/NGOs; would license them to collect public deposits, pubic savings, issue bonds and invest that money in social enterprises development in Ontario. This investment process would help NPRGSEs mobilize their internal funds as well as promote green small enterprises and serve as a community outreach in Ontario. The earnings from this <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> mobilization process would also be used by NPRGSEs for scaling up outreach programs. In order to make these happen, this paper recommends establishing an independent „Green Social Enterprise Commission ‟ where solid green social enterprise polices and Acts would be developed and executed. The Green Social Enterprise Commission would also monitor the activities of the NPRGSEs and allow non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to transform into green social enterprises MFIs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the share of}} investment in fixed capital and working capital financed by retained earnings using a harmonized dataset from the World Bank Enterprise Survey.

Descriptive statistics are presented for the share of purchases of fixed assets financed with <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> or retained earnings, the share of working capital financed with <b>internal</b> <b>funds,</b> the ratio between <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> used for purchasing fixed assets and sales, and annual purchases of fixed assets (as a proportion of annual sales). Also presented are stylized facts exploring how these variables differ by country, firm size, firm age, registration, sector of activity, and ownership. It is found that <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> are extensively used to finance both purchases of fixed assets and working capital, particularly by smaller firms located in countries with less developed financial markets. Investment in fixed assets represents about 7. 5 percent of sales {{in the region and}} is significantly higher among larger and registered firms...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} redefines {{the patterns}} of the stock performance around corporate financ-ing activities and provides an explanation based on moral hazard to the long-term post-financing stock underperformance. I partition firms according to their <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> {{at the time of}} their financing activities and find that pre-financing price run-up is much stronger among firms with high <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> at the time of financing, while post-financing stock underperformance is concentrated among firms with low <b>internal</b> <b>funds</b> at the time of ex-ternal financing. This new finding is different from the traditional association between pre-financing price run-up and post-financing stock underperformance. I also investigate how external financing affects incentives and long-term post-financing stock performance condi-tioned on the availability of <b>internal</b> <b>funds.</b> First, Post-financing stock underperformance is disproportionately large during earnings announcement periods. Furthermore, these firms experience less decrease in post-financing average selling, general, and administrative ex-penses due to economies of scale from expansion. Finally, related to their external financing activities, these firms have a weaker information environment represented by more opti-mistic analyst earnings forecasts, larger forecast dispersion, and lower analyst coverage. This empirical evidence is consistent with existence and underestimation of a moral hazard problem induced by conflicts between current shareholders and new claimholders when firms lack <b>internal</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. A lack {{of capital}} {{is one of}} the factors that inhibit {{business}} development in the developing world, including South Africa. This is especially true for a prospective business where the owner does not have security to secure a bank loan. A financing option that is available to entrepreneurs is venture capital. However, venture capitalists reject 88 percent of all new applications for venture capital in the initial screening phase. This study examined the reasons for the high rejection rate of applications for venture capital in South Africa. Non-compliance with the <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> preferences of venture capitalist firms was identified as one of the biggest reasons for the rejection of applications for venture capital. Other factors were also investigated with specific reference to the Timmons Model of the entrepreneurial process. It was determined that factors relating to team, opportunity, and resources are also important in the initial screening phase, but they are not as important as <b>internal</b> <b>fund</b> preferences. Uniquely South African factors were also investigated and it was determined that factors relating to black economic empowerment and corporate citizenship play a relatively unimportant role in the approval of new ventures by venture capitalists. Based on the above-mentioned study, a Framework for venture capital seekers was developed. This framework is aimed at increasing the probability of applications for venture capital passing the initial screening phase. Master...|$|E
30|$|The {{empirical}} {{studies on the}} determination of corporate investment have largely {{been focused on the}} firm specific factors. Lamont (1997) has identified that internal funds are accounted for more than three quarters of capital expenditure outlays for the period 1981 – 1991 for US non-financial corporations. A perfect capital market has free access to external market which leads to the fact that investment decisions will be based on the future profitability and growth opportunities and it does not depend on the <b>internal</b> <b>fund.</b> In an imperfect capital market, the internal and external finances are not perfect substitutes as the presence of information asymmetry cost (Myers and Majluf 1984) and agency cost (Jensen and Meckling 1976) create a wedge between the internal and external funds, making the latter more costly.|$|E
