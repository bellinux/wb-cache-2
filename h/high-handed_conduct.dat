60|$|The {{taxes were}} onerous in the extreme. By {{means of a}} council that had been appointed, {{consisting}} of notabilities who had, either by fear or bribery, been brought {{over to the side}} of the French, a crushing taxation was imposed, and this rendered the trading and upper classes, upon whom the burden principally fell, as hostile to the French domination as were the lower classes. Thus the French themselves had, by their <b>high-handed</b> <b>conduct</b> and their absolute disregard for the feelings and religious sentiments of the people, prepared a mine that was on the point of exploding.|$|E
60|$|Never {{in all the}} world, perhaps, were a man's {{feelings}} so outraged as {{were the}} General's. He {{said he had never}} heard of such <b>high-handed</b> <b>conduct</b> in all his life as this Morgan's. And he said there was no use in going to law--Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was --nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it, and no lawyer would take his case and no judge listen to it. Hyde said that right there was where he was mistaken--everybody in town sustained Morgan; Hal Brayton, a very smart lawyer, had taken his case; the courts being in vacation, it was to be tried before a referee, and ex-Governor Roop had already been appointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall near the hotel at two that afternoon.|$|E
40|$|Internal audit is {{supposed}} to help members of organizations to improve their business activities. But the findings from in-depth interviews with internal auditors from a total of 40 federal government ministries, departments and agencies in Malaysia, conducted {{in the middle of}} 2004, have revealed a number of serious shortcomings. Most notable of these shortcomings are that many internal audit units have a shortage of staff, and that the audit staff lack internal audit skills. In addition, a majority of the audit units still employ outdated audit practices, and have failed to get the right level of support and assistance from the Treasury. Worse still, their operational effectiveness and efficiency is threatened by the <b>high-handed</b> <b>conduct</b> of the National Audit Department which arbitrarily and unilaterally shuffles staff between the body and internal audit units. With national and pubic sector surrounding leaving much to be desired for in regard to transparency and public accountability of the major actors and the fact that Malaysia is a large power distance society, it may not be too far fetch to expect the internal audit quagmire to continue to take place into the foreseeable future...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} audit function is around to help members of organization in improving their activities. But {{the findings from}} in‐depth interviews conducted {{in the middle of}} 2004 with {{internal audit}}ors from a total of 40 federal government ministries, departments and agencies in Malaysia have revealed a number of serious shortcomings that far outweigh the few virtues around. That is, many internal audit units have to face with the problem of shortage of staff and audit staff lacking in competency in internal audit. In addition, a majority of the audit units which are mostly operating in the less than advance audit mode has failed to get the right level of support and assistance from the Treasury and other parties. Worse, their effectiveness and efficiency is threatened by the <b>high‐handed</b> <b>conduct</b> of the National Audit Department over the shifting of its cadre staff {{in and out of the}} internal audit units. Despite all these problems, the internal auditors are quite optimistic of the audit future. On the other hand, politics of accountability theory, power distance and a Malaysian social context that replete with cases of the lack of transparency and public accountability of its major actors point to the audit’s probable bleak future...|$|E
