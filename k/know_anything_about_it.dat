25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E

According to People, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but to me there was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E

500|$|Veronica asks Keith (Enrico Colantoni) about Lianne's suspension, {{which she}} thinks was about {{spreading}} {{a rumor that}} Celeste was pregnant. Keith says that he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Trina slips and falls during a play rehearsal. Beaver meets with Kendall and confronts her about selling his father's possessions for little money. Beaver gives her his plan, which involves her being {{the face of his}} business idea. Keith checks the birth records and finds that no baby was born to either [...] "Kane" [...] or [...] "Carnathan" [...] (Celeste's maiden name) at that time. However, he finds a mysterious baby found in the girls' bathroom at the Neptune high prom. Veronica bad-mouths Celeste in Duncan's room before Celeste comes in and Veronica learns that Duncan never told his parents about their relationship. Celeste insults Veronica's mother, and Veronica deduces that Celeste's cleaning lady, Astrid, is probably her daughter. Weevil confronts Logan angrily, and they fight, despite agreeing that they need to team up to find out who actually killed Felix.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, actors Hiroyuki Sanada, Hal Yamanouchi, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima {{had been}} cast as Shingen, Ichirō, Mariko and Yukio, respectively. Additionally, Will Yun Lee was cast as Harada, and Brian Tee as Noburo Mori. By July 2012, Deadline.com said Jessica Biel would play Viper. However, at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Biel said {{her role in}} the film was [...] "not a done deal", explaining, [...] "People keep talking about this. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It's a little bit too soon for that kind of an announcement". A few days later, {{negotiations}} between Biel and 20th Century Fox had broken down. Later in July, Fox had begun talks with Svetlana Khodchenkova to take over the role. Somewhat unusually for action movies, The Wolverine features four female lead roles and [...] "passes the Bechdel Test early and often", according to Vulture. Mangold noted that he wrote his heroines so that [...] "they all have missions. They all have jobs to do other than be the object of affection", intent of avoiding the [...] "worn out" [...] trope of the woman in jeopardy.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

Plame has characterized the damage as [...] "serious", noting, [...] "I can tell you, all the intelligence services {{in the world that}} morning were running my name through their databases to see, `Did anyone by this name come in the country? When? Do we <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> Where did she stay? Well, who did she see?'"

2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E
