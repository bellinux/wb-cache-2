[...] says Abednego, {{whose father}} was a mock-jewel and gold- lace {{merchant}} in Hanway Yard; and I promised {{that he should have}} a sight of it {{as soon as it was}} set. As my pocket-money was run out too (by coach-hire to and from home, five shillings to our maid at home, ten to my aunt's maid and man, five-and-twenty shillings lost at whist, as I said, and fifteen-and-six paid for a silver scissors for the dear little fingers of Somebody), Roundhand, who was very good-natured, asked me to dine, and advanced me 7l. 1s. 8d., a month's salary. It was at Roundhand's house, Myddelton Square, Pentonville, over a <b>fillet</b> <b>of</b> veal and <b>bacon</b> and a glass of port, that I learned and saw how his wife ill- treated him; as I have told before. Poor fellow!--we under-clerks all thought it was a fine thing to sit at a desk by oneself, and have 50l. per month, as Roundhand had; but I've a notion that Hoskins and I, blowing duets on the flute together in our second floor in Salisbury Square, were a great deal more at ease than our head--and more in harmony, too; though we made sad work of the music, certainly.|$|R
