25|$|During {{the mass}} <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>education</b> {{movement}} from 1910–40, {{there was an}} increase in skilled workers, which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor. <b>High</b> <b>school</b> <b>education</b> during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>education,</b> which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.|$|E
