25|$|The Wolfhound was {{historically}} a {{dog that}} only nobles could own and was {{taken up by the}} British during their rule in Ireland. This made it unpopular as a national symbol and the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> was adopted by Republicans such as Michael Collins.The Wolfhound has been adopted as a symbol by both rugby codes. The national rugby league team is nicknamed the Wolfhounds, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, which governs rugby union, changed the name of the country's A (second-level) national team in that code to the Ireland Wolfhounds in 2010.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier.</b> The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
500|$|Bedlington Terriers {{are closely}} related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. In fact, the Earl of Antrim once {{exhibited}} two terriers from the same litter, and one won shows as a Dandie Dinmont, while the other won shows as a Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers are also related to the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. The shape of its back suggests that it may related to the Whippet and it may also be related to the otterhound. Bedlington Terriers have been crossed with Whippets to produce a Lurcher with [...] "extra guts, pep, [...] fire." ...|$|E
50|$|Along with <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers,</b> Cresteds {{can develop}} canine {{multiple}} system degeneration (CMSD) also called progressive neuronal abiotrophy (PNA) in <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers.</b> This is a progressive movement disorder {{that begins with}} cerebellar ataxia between 10 and 14 weeks of age. After 6 months of age, affected dogs develop difficulty initiating movements and fall frequently. The gene responsible has been mapped to canine chromosome 1.|$|R
50|$|Breeds {{known to}} be {{affected}} include Rhodesian Ridgeback and Thai Ridgeback, {{in which it is}} hereditary, <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers,</b> Shih Tzus and Boxers.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers</b> {{increased}} {{dramatically in the}} Dublin area as it gained admirers in the early 1920s. On St. Patrick's Day 1921, a conformation dog show was organized which included other breeds, {{in opposition to the}} English Kennel Club. The popularity of the show was the catalyst that {{led to the formation of}} the Irish Kennel Club. The first meeting was held on January 20, 1922. Today, it is a member of the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{wolfhound}} {{is generally}} considered Ireland's national breed, although some, including Michael Collins, have put forward the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> as an alternative.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> {{with black}} mask. Although the coat {{on the body}} has {{lightened}} in color in {{a process known as}} [...] "clearing" [...] or [...] "greying", the mask has retained its original color.|$|E
50|$|As a long-legged breed, the {{activity}} {{level of the}} <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> ranges from moderate to high. They require an active, skilled owner who can provide them with early socialisation and obedience training. Kerries require daily exercise.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers,</b> Poodles, and Bearded Collies, [...] "blue" [...] {{refers to}} {{colouration}} that is black at birth and progressively greys {{out as the}} dog matures. In Australian Shepherds, Rough Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs, blue means a blue (black-based) merle. In Australian Silky <b>Terriers,</b> <b>blue</b> means a saddle-type black and tan pattern, where the black parts of the coat progressively fade to a steel grey as the dog matures, and in Australian Cattle Dogs, blue stands for a densely ticked black-based colouration with an overall blue-grey appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Em allows {{similar pattern}} {{expression}} to E except any tan (phaeomelanin) {{areas on the}} mask area are replaced with eumelanin (black/etc.) The mask can vary from the muzzle, to the face and ears, to a larger area with shading {{on the front and}} sides as in the Belgian Tervuren. The mask Em is unaffected by the greying gene G and will remain dark in a G/- animal {{while the rest of the}} dog pales, such as in <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers.</b> Some puppies are born with a mask which fades away within a few weeks of birth: these puppies do not have the Em allele and their temporary mask is due to sabling.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terriers</b> are strong-headed {{and highly}} spirited. They {{have always been}} loyal and affectionate towards their owners and very gentle towards {{children}} but were often considered downright mean toward other animals, including other dogs. If they are socialised with other dogs {{this is no longer}} the case. In the early days of competitive dog showing, the Irish Kennel Club required Kerries had to pass a [...] "gameness" [...] test, known as Teastas Mor certification, before they were deemed worthy of being judged. These tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay in its set. They are fast, strong, and intelligent, and they do well in obedience, dog agility, sheep herding, and tracking. They have been used as police dogs in Ireland. Modern breeders have attempted to retain high spirits whilst breeding out aggression.|$|R

5000|$|Mick was {{credited}} with raising {{the profile of the}} <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> in the United States due to his victory at Westminster. He was called the [...] "most influential Kerry Blue alive" [...] in 2008 by The New York Times. Sixty one of his children have gone on to qualify as show champions, and his sperm has been frozen for artificial insemination in the future.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} breeds of dogs {{which may have}} a blue coat {{including}} the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Bluetick Coonhound and Grand Bleu de Gascogne. This arises in two main ways: from a dilution or silvering of a black coat {{so that it is}} seen as blue-grey; or from a mottling or marbling effect which mixes black and white to be seen as navy blue. Dogs with blue coats are often prone to skin allergies.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{development}} of dog shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed became standardised and [...] "tidied up" [...] for the show ring. The Irish nationalist leader Michael Collins owned a famous <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> named Convict 224. Collins even made an attempt to have the <b>Kerry</b> <b>blue</b> adopted as the national dog of Ireland. Love of dogs did, however, cross political divides. The first show of the Dublin Irish <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> club took place outside official curfew hours and was entered both by those fighting for and against an Ireland republic. The Dublin Irish <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> Club was so successful it led directly to {{the foundation of the}} Irish Kennel Club, and a <b>Kerry</b> <b>blue</b> was the first dog that club registered.|$|R
50|$|The {{junior and}} senior {{football}} teams, known as the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blues,</b> are considered {{among the best in}} Ontario. The Jr. <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blues</b> won their third Ontario Regional Invitational. (2002, 2004, 2008) In 2008, the Senior <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blues</b> won their seventh Metro Bowl, making the St. Michael's <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blues</b> the most bowl-winning team in Ontario. They have won the Metro Bowl three years in a row. There have been many <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blues</b> Football alumni that have gone on to win the CIAU National Football Championship with their respective universities. The 1993 Vanier Cup Champion University of Toronto Varsity Blues had several SMC Alumni: Christopher Tyndorf, Lou Tiro and Peter Woo. National Football League players Glen Young, O.J. Santiago and Michael Labinjo, each of whom have competed in the Super Bowl, played football while attending St. Michael’s.|$|R

5000|$|The Wheaten was bred in Ireland {{for over}} two hundred years to be an {{all-purpose}} farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing.

5000|$|Strict Irish Kennel Club rules governed the Teastas Mor (certificate of gameness). It was {{considered}} that the discipline ensured contests between dog and badger were fair.

Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Irish Terrier ( [...] Irish Red Terriers) and <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Terrier</b> (a.k.a. Irish Blue Terriers) were the principal breeds used.

50|$|The breed's origin is not known. It is {{believed}} to have descended from the black and tan terrier-type dogs of Britain and Ireland, just like the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> and Irish Soft-haired Wheaten Terriers in Ireland or the Welsh, Lakeland and Scottish Terriers in Great Britain. There is also conjecture that the breed may share bloodlines with the Irish Wolfhound.|$|R
50|$|The coat is the {{key feature}} of the Kerry. It is soft and wavy with no undercoat. The 'texture' feels like a {{combination}} of fine human hair and wool. It does not shed but continues to grow throughout the year. This means the <b>Kerry</b> <b>Blue</b> requires very regular grooming (at least once per week) and clipping an average of every 6 weeks.|$|R
