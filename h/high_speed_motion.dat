Ten participants were asked to perform reaching and throwing actions which were recorded simultaneously by a Kinect and a motion analysis corporation (MAC) capture system.

The complex resembles a circular bubble 600 pc in diameter with a young super star cluster (SSC) near the center. The kinematics of ionized gas is studied through Hα emission with several slit positions. Position–velocity diagrams show two distinct features with <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>motions.</b> One is an irregularly shaped region to the east of the SSC, 270 pc in size, in which most of the Hα emission is blue shifted by 120 km s − 1, and another is a 350 pc shell centered on the SSC with positive and negative velocity shifts of 60 km s − 1. Balmer and Hei absorption lines in the SSC give an age of 12 − 13 Myr, which is consistent with the photometric age but significantly older than the kinematic ages of the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> regions. The energetics of the SSC and its interaction with the environment are considered.
