Blue-light dependent positioning of both organelles is mediated by the blue-light receptor phototropin and controlled by the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, however, it seems that chloroplast movement requires short, fine actin filaments organized at the chloroplast edge, whereas nuclear movement does cytoplasmic, thick actin bundles intimately associated with the nucleus. Although there are many similarities between photo-relocation movements of chloroplasts and nuclei, plant cells appear to have evolved distinct mechanisms to regulate actin organization required for driving the movements of these organelles...|$|R

40|$|In {{epidermal}} and mesophyll {{cells of}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves, nuclei become relocated {{in response to}} strong blue light. We previously reported that nuclear positions both in <b>darkness</b> and in <b>strong</b> blue light are regulated by the blue light receptor phototropin 2 in mesophyll cells. Here, we investigate the involvement of phototropin and the actin cytoskeleton in nuclear positioning in epidermal cells. Analysis of geometrical parameters revealed that, in darkness, nuclei were distributed {{near the center of}} the cell, adjacent to the inner periclinal wall, independent of cell shape. Dividing the anticlinal wall into concave, convex, and intermediate regions indicated that, in strong blue light, nuclei became relocated preferably to a concave region of the anticlinal wall, nearest the center of the cell. Mutant analyses verified that light-dependent nuclear positioning was regulated by phototropin 2, while dark positioning of nuclei was independent of phototropin. Nuclear movement was inhibited by an actin-depolymerizing reagent, latrunculin B, but not by a microtubule-disrupting reagent, propyzamide. Imaging actin organization by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that thick actin bundles, periclinally arranged parallel to the longest axis of the epidermal cell, were associated with the nucleus in <b>darkness,</b> whereas under <b>strong</b> blue light, the actin bundles, especially in the vicinity of the nucleus, became arranged close to the anticlinal walls. Light-dependent changes in the actin organization were clear in phot 1 mutant but not in phot 2 and phot 1 phot 2 mutants.

More interestingly, HABI-TPE exhibited reversible fluorescence switching upon alternating irradiation with blue or near-UV light (wavelength less than 490 nm) and green light (more than 490 nm) in condensed state.

40|$|Seed development, dormancy, germination, {{desiccation}} {{tolerance and}} survival ex-situ were studied in selected {{members of the}} Amaryllidaceae following reports of poor seed germination and storability. Seed dry weight accumulation of temperate woodland European Galanthus nivalis L. and Narcissus pseudonarcissus L. continued until seed dispersal with no subsequent maturation drying phase. Seeds shed at high moisture contents (> 60 % FWB). In both species, the ability of seeds to germinate developed before the ability to tolerate desiccation; the latter was not acquired in some seeds at dispersal. Embryo elongation occurred during seed development which continued post-shedding, more rapidly at warmer temperatures similar to summer temperatures of the natural post-shedding environment. Warm temperatures alleviated physiological dormancy gradually; germination occurred in most seeds at subsequent cooler, autumn-like temperatures. This pattern was repeated in seeds which did not germinate initially. Constant temperatures and darkness promoted germination in both species, with <b>darkness</b> a <b>strong</b> requirement for G. nivalis. Desiccation increased dormancy in a proportion of N pseudo narcissus seeds. Seeds 'of European Leucojum aestivum L. and N pseudo narcissus and American Rhodophiala bagnoldii (Herb.) Traub, Rhodophiala advena (Ker Gawl.) Traub and Zephyranthes drummondii D. Don tolerated drying to 4. 1 - 5. 5 % moisture content. Seeds of the American and European species survived sub-zero storage for over four years and six months respectively, and are probably orthodox. Galanthus nivalis seed survival on desiccation varied considerably amongst populations: virtually no seeds survived drying to 7. 1 - 7. 3 % moisture content while others tolerated desiccation to 12 - 18 %, suggesting possible intermediate seed storage behaviour. Seeds of these American and European species {{are estimated to be}} relatively short-lived in seed bank storage compared with species from other families.

After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead.

She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her pay for what she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing.
