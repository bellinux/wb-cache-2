25|$|Supersulfated cements contain about 80% ground {{granulated}} {{blast furnace}} slag, 15% gypsum or anhydrite {{and a little}} Portland clinker or lime as an activator.

25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., <b>ettringite</b> or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} early failure of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E

At some pillars and tiers, there were more than 7000 cracks detected. Public concern about the safety issues at Kepong Flyover was due to the risks faced by at least 4,300 motorists using the flyover at a time. Investigations were carried out by 4 different parties, namely Maunsell, Sharma & Zakaria (the designer), Köhler & Seitz Engineering Services (appointed by the contractor), Halcrow Consultants Ltd.

On August 10, 2004, the Works Minister, Dato' Seri S Samy Vellu, reminded the public that the cracks were not due to design flaw and [...] "nobody can simply open their mouth and suggest it is design flaw" [...] (Bernama 10 August 2004).

Hydration produces <b>ettringite,</b> and specialized physical properties (such as expansion or rapid reaction) are obtained by adjustment {{of the availability of}} calcium and sulfate ions. Their use as a low-energy alternative to Portland cement has been pioneered in China, where several million tonnes per year are produced. Energy requirements are lower because of the lower kiln temperatures required for reaction, and the lower amount of limestone (which must be endothermically decarbonated) in the mix. In addition, the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a CO2 emission around half that associated with Portland clinker. However, SO2 emissions are usually significantly higher.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{analyzing}} {{the structure of}} both <b>ettringite</b> and thaumasite, it was deduced that both minerals have hexagonal structures, but different space groups. <b>Ettringite</b> crystals have a P31c with a=11.224 Å, c= 21,108 Å, while thaumasite crystals fall into space group P63 with a= 11.04 Å, c= 10.39 Å. While these two minerals form a solid solution, the difference in space groups lead to discontinuities in unit cell parameters. Differences between structures of <b>ettringite</b> and thaumasite arise from the columns of cations and anions: <b>Ettringite</b> cation columns are composed of Ca3Al(OH)6·12H2O3+, which run parallel to the c axis, and the other columns of sulfate anions and water molecules in channels parallel to these columns. In contrast, thaumasite consists of a cylindrical column of Ca3Si(OH)6·12H2O3+ in the c axis, with sulfate and carbonate anions in channels between these columns which contain water molecules as well.|$|E

Ye'elimite is most commonly encountered as a constituent of sulfoaluminate cements, {{in which it is}} manufactured on the million-tonne-per-annum scale.

50|$|Accelerated curing {{techniques}} invariably involve high temperatures. This {{may induce}} thermal stresses in the concrete. Further, {{the water in}} the pores starts to exert pressure at higher temperatures. The combined effect of the pore pressure and thermal stresses causes a tensile stress within the body of the concrete. If the accelerated curing process is begun immediately after the concrete has been poured, then the concrete {{will not be able to}} withstand the tensile stresses as it requires time to gain some strength. Moreover, these microcracks formed may then lead to the delayed formation of <b>ettringite,</b> which is formed by the transformation of metastable monosulfate. Delayed <b>ettringite</b> formation (DEF) induces expansion in the concrete thereby weakening it. DEF is promoted by the formation of the cracks which enables the easy entry of water. Therefore, a delay period is allowed to elapse before the commencement of the curing process to allow the concrete to gain a certain minimum tensile strength. The setting time of the concrete is an important criterion to determine the delay period. Generally, the delay period is equal to the initial setting time which has been found to give satisfactory results. Lesser delay periods result in compressive strength losses.|$|E
