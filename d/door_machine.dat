25|$|In 2010, German {{newspaper}} Bild {{reported that}} German Army experts had {{concerns that the}} helicopter was not yet ready for the transportation of combat troops. They stated that the seats were only rated for 110kg (240lb), not considered enough for a fully equipped soldier. Heavy infantry weapons could not be adequately secured and the cabin floor was prone to damage, citing an anecdote of damage caused by footwear. The helicopter could only land on firm ground, with obstacles not exceeding 16cm (6.3in). Troops carrying full equipment could not use the rear ramp due to weight-limitations placed on it. Adding a <b>door</b> <b>machine</b> gun was not possible due to space taken by troop ingress and egress; there was also no provision for fast roping or paratroop equipment. In response, the German Defense Ministry proclaimed that this article referred to a prototype, not to the production model; the specifications for which were not even finalised at the time. The prototype evaluation and its results were described as a normal procedure in an ongoing design process.|$|E

Colt engineer Rob Roy designed a special ammunition box to hold a 50-round or 120-round ammunition belt {{as well as the}} expended links. The belt-fed CAR-15 was similar to the belt-fed AR-10 developed by Eugene Stoner and John Peck at ArmaLite. The Army evaluated its use as a helicopter <b>door</b> <b>machine</b> gun but rejected it, so less than 20 of the Heavy Assault Rifle M2s were made.|$|E

40|$|The {{microcontroller}} and {{the coding}} {{is the heart}} of making a timer. The strategic release planning is gotten from the concept of how a <b>door</b> <b>machine</b> with password access functions. In this thesis project, all that has been studied in school such as circuit theory, electronics, digital design and microprocessors basic and programming course are combined to the success of this project. Therefore the objective is producing a practical knowledge of what has been studied which is the timer with password access. The method used was an inspiration gotten after reviewing many materials in some respective topic related to designing a timer. The particular method comes from creating an SPI Interface from the Programmer to the Microcontroller to Make Transferring More Convenient. The performance of the MCU, LCD and keypad was just as was expected in the software code and hardware also. The password is inputted, timer is set appropriately and timer runs till port is opened. To conclude, the result can be achieved in different method but this method was for an easy method for beginners. 076435355...|$|E

40|$|Most work places {{operating}} machines {{have a lot}} {{of background}} noise that affect evacuation from a factory. Especially, a lot of background noise from utility machines cause delay of awareness of fire alarm sound and also increase death rate. Currently, sky-scraper type factories have been constructed at around big cities because of high land price. The complexity of skyscraper type factories leads to increase death rate on fire. This study was to research problems using experiment as the same workplace sit-uation according to KOFEIS 0305 and the US Fire Protection Handbook. The experiment was conducted using the speakers to produce machine sound(70 dB, 80 dB, 90 dB) in the room. The fire alarm sound was produced from a corridor. Also the exper-iment was done using persons(around 20 years old and without damage of ears) under different conditions such as distance from the alarm system, open and closed <b>doors,</b> <b>machine</b> sounds, and with and without ear protection. As a result of the measurements, it showed {{that in the case of}} wearing ear protection, most people could not hear fire alarm sound in the room with closed door. NFPA suggests that the alarm system should be considered of other methods to know alarm sound when the background noise exceeds 85 dB or more. Therefore it was concluded that the design of the fire alarm systems should not be applied to the work...|$|R

50|$|Féeries used a fairy-tale {{aesthetic}} {{to combine}} theatre with music, dances, mime, acrobatics, and especially spectacular visual effects created by innovative stage machinery, such as trap <b>doors,</b> smoke <b>machines,</b> and quickly changeable sets. Songs always appeared, usually featuring new lyrics to familiar melodies. Transformation scenes, {{in which a}} scene would change {{as if by magic}} {{in full view of the}} audience, were an important component of the style; until 1830, nearly all scene changes in féeries were full-view transformations. The last transformation in a féerie, accompanied by a flourish of music, led to the apotheosis: a grand final stage picture, usually involving beautiful supernumeraries descending from the sky or suspended on wires.|$|R
5000|$|You {{can compare}} a {{flowchart}} to {{an assembly line}} in manufacturing because the flowchart describes the progression of some task {{from beginning to end}} (e.g., transforming source code input into object code output by a compiler).

The <b>door</b> state <b>machine</b> shown {{at the top of this}} article, for example, is not in a more advanced stage when it is in the [...] "closed" [...] state, compared to being in the [...] "opened" [...] state; it simply reacts differently to the open/close events. A state in a state machine is an efficient way of specifying a particular behavior, rather than a stage of processing.|$|R

25|$|SA-2 Samson is a twin-ducted fan VTOL utility aircraft, {{similar in}} role and {{appearance}} to the real-world UH-60 Black Hawk, Mi-8 or UH-1 Huey utility helicopters. It is armed with two <b>door</b> mounted <b>machine</b> guns and two pylons near the cockpit with missile pods mounted on them. The pair of ducted-fan assemblies, each with two coaxial propellers, enable the Samson of 6,000 kilograms lifting capability by manufacturers specifications, but lifting performance is rated at 150% {{of that on}} Pandora due to the thicker atmosphere. Both ducted-fan assemblies are capable of changing blade pitch independently. From the pilot perspective, forward and aft, lift, yaw and roll authority are accomplished by similar sets of controls found in conventional helicopters. Propulsion is twin Goetz-Korman turbine generators.|$|R

In the United States, MELs comprise nearly one quarter of residential energy use, larger than either heating or cooling energy end-use. In low-energy houses, this percentage increases dramatically, because MELs are often ignored while increasing whole-house efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic Optimization {{refers to}} any program {{optimization}} performed {{after the initial}} static compile time. While typically not designed {{as a replacement for}} static optimization, dynamic optimization is a complementary optimization opportunity that leverages a vast amount of information that is not available until runtime. Dynamic optimization opens the <b>doors</b> for <b>machine</b> and user-specific optimizations without the need for original source code. This thesis includes three contributions to the field of dynamic optimization. The first main goal is the survey of several current approaches to dynamic optimization, as well as its related topics of dynamic compilation, the postponement of some or all of compilation until runtime, and dynamic translation, the translation of an executable from one instruction-set architecture (ISA) to another. The second major goal of this thesis is the proposal of a new infrastructure for dynamic optimization in EPIC architectures. Several salient features of the EPIC ISA prove it to be not only a good candidate for dynamic optimization, but such optimizations are essential for scalability that is up to par with superscalar processors.
