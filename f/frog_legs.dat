5|$|<b>Frog</b> <b>legs</b> are {{eaten by}} humans {{in many parts}} of the world. French cuisses de grenouille or <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> dish is a {{traditional}} dish particularly served in the region of the Dombes (département of Ain). The dish is also common in French-speaking parts of Louisiana, particularly the Cajun areas of Southern Louisiana as well as New Orleans, United States. In Asia, <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> are consumed in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Chinese edible frog and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China. <b>Frog</b> <b>legs</b> are part of Chinese Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. In Indonesia, frog-leg soup is known as swikee or swike. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E
5000|$|Luigi Galvani, an Italian physicist, {{discovered}} something he named [...] "animal electricity" [...] when two different metals were connected {{in series with}} a <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> and to one another. Volta realised that the <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an electrolyte) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the <b>frog's</b> <b>leg</b> with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.|$|R

25|$|Frogs are an {{excellent}} example of all three trends: <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> can be nearly twice the body length, leg muscles may account for up to twenty percent of body weight, and they have not only lengthened the foot, shin and thigh, but extended the ankle bones into another limb joint and similarly extended the hip bones and gained mobility at the sacrum for a second 'extra joint'. As a result, frogs are the undisputed champion jumpers of vertebrates, leaping over fifty body lengths, a distance of more than eight feet.|$|E
500|$|Leopoldo Nobili built a frog battery in 1818 out of {{complete}} <b>frog</b> <b>legs</b> {{which he called}} a frog pile.
