40|$|Remotely operated, {{semi-automatic}} machines, {{designed to}} effect the mechanical disassembly (i. e., <b>decanning)</b> <b>of</b> spent <b>fuel</b> elements from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, were developed. The machines described are laboratory models which successfully decanned simulated fuel elements. They are electrically or pneumatically operated and are capable <b>of</b> <b>decanning</b> three <b>fuel</b> elements per minute without the routine use of manipulators. Each machine {{is made up of}} functional units which are sequentially placed to eliminate handling between steps <b>of</b> the <b>decanning</b> operation and which are easily removable for replacement or maintenance. In the first of the two machines described, pneumatically operated devices prepare the fuel element for a rotary shearing operation which cuts the tubing jacket along a helical circumferential path as it is being removed. The alternate machine removes the jacket by means of a series of shearing rolls. Both machines are served by auxiliary mechanisms, such as inspection jigs, fuel and scrap choppers, and transfer magazines. (auth...|$|R
