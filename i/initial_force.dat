5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} had outrun {{the supporting}} artillery and the <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> {{of more than}} 500 tanks that played {{a large role in}} the Allied success was reduced to six tanks fit for battle within four days. The Germans on Chipilly Spur commanded a wide field of fire to the south of the Somme, and their flanking fire held up the left units of the Australian Corps until late on 9 August, when a small Australian party slipped across the river and captured the village of Chipilly itself, together with a renewed attack by III Corps. On the Canadian front, congested roads and communication problems prevented the British 32nd Division being pushed forward rapidly enough to maintain the momentum of the advance.|$|E
5|$|Villadarias {{decided to}} send a force of 2,000 men– {{nearly a third of}} his entire army– divided into two groups: an <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> of 500 to seize the heights at night, {{followed}} by a further 1,500 the following daybreak. The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. They {{made it to the top}} of the Rock, reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered overnight in St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side of the Rock, and killed the English sentries in the lookout point at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.|$|E
40|$|When {{constructing}} large-span metal domes {{different methods}} of installation are used, which depend on geometry schemes of the frames and their construction solution. The frames of such domes {{consist of a}} lot of structures. During assembling large number of structures with different spatial orientation are joined together. Little differences of structures lead to distortion of their real geometric form compared to the design form. A computer analysis of the values of the <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> due to force elimination of assembly errors of double-layer framed metal dome has been performed. The position errors of nodes of planar meridional ribs were considered in the annular directions at installation of the dome frame with temporary central support. The <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> due to the connection of already assembled sectors of the dome with annular elements at different stages of the construction of the frame of the dome are investigated. For this purpose concentrated forces were applied to the nodes of the sectors to eliminate relative deviations of the connected ribs, and <b>initial</b> internal <b>forces</b> in the bars were registered. The values of the <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> in the bars were compared to the values of the <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> due to the dead load and design load. The results of the investigation are presented in the form of figures, schemes, diagrams, and tables. The conclusions are made on the influence of the <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> on the stress-strain state of the dome frame...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's {{formation}} training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed quickly into collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{observations of}} the structural behaviour of the Tweede Heine-noordtunnel, a shield-driven tunnel in typical Dutch soft soils.

The measurements {{have shown that the}} assembly of the rings causes very significant <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> and moments in the segments. Moreover, these <b>initial</b> <b>forces</b> and moments do not decrease significantly, as is often believed. Since conventional tunnel design models do not consider the effects of assembly on forces and moments, predicted maximum forces and moments in the lining appeared to be about half the measured values. Another impor-tant observation is that near the closing segment strong three dimensional effects occur as ring forces seem to migrate through small zones of the key segment...|$|R

30|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>forces</b> or impact pulse applied on bars will {{obviously}} {{affect the}} final state {{at end of}} time duration and the speed of dynamic evolution process. The induced higher accelerations on nodes will cause the nodes to oscillate at higher amplitudes. Therefore, the intermediate state will be missed in the time history records. In the present example, the <b>initial</b> bar <b>forces</b> (pre-compressions) are obtained from a spherical geodesic dome (as original bar lengths). If this radium of the geodesic dome is chosen with a large difference between the target ellipsoid semi-principal axes, then the <b>initial</b> bar <b>forces</b> and the forces calculated during dynamic relaxation will be higher and induce time states with lower resolution. Thus, the initial geometry is suggested to be as closer to the target as possible.|$|R

25|$|Austrian {{commander}} Klenau, with an <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> of 18,000 men and 64 cannons had {{orders to}} delay the French pursuit. On 9 July, Klenau decided to make another stand, this time near Hollabrunn, around 55 kilometers northwest of Vienna. Following the initial skirmishes, Klenau's force was still 17,000 men strong and it now occupied a strong position. Opposite to him, Masséna only had under his immediate control General Claude Legrand's 1st division of IV Corps, the Corps cavalry under General Jacob François Marulaz and the cuirassiers from the 2nd heavy cavalry division of General Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice. Masséna promptly engaged Klenau, {{while at the same}} time conducting a full reconnaissance of the battlefield, which enabled him to write to the Emperor and reconfirm that no Austrian regiments were heading towards Krems. Masséna's attacks were at first successful, but Klenau counterattacked and repulsed the French and then opposed staunch resistance to any further attacks. The outnumbered Masséna was forced to break off the combat and wait for his other three infantry divisions, knowing that Claude Carra Saint-Cyr's division would be able to rejoin him shortly, but that Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's and Jean Boudet's were much too far off to be of any assistance.|$|E
25|$|A {{contrasting}} {{version of}} Custer's death {{is suggested by}} the testimony of an Oglala named Joseph White Cow Bull, according to novelist and Custer biographer Evan Connell, who relates that Joseph White Bull stated he had shot a rider wearing a buckskin jacket and big hat at the riverside when the soldiers first approached the village from the east. The <b>initial</b> <b>force</b> facing the soldiers, according to this version, was quite small (possibly as few as four warriors) yet challenged Custer's command. The rider who was hit was mounted next to a rider who bore a flag and had shouted orders that prompted the soldiers to attack, but when the buckskin-clad rider fell off his horse after being shot, many of the attackers reined up. The allegation that the buckskin-clad officer was Custer, if accurate, might explain the supposed rapid disintegration of Custer's forces. However, several other officers of the Seventh, including William Cooke and Tom Custer, were also dressed in buckskin {{on the day of the}} battle, and the fact that each of the non-mutilation wounds to George Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded or killed at the ford, more than a mile from where his body was found. The circumstances are, however, consistent with David Humphreys Miller's suggestion that Custer's attendants would not have left his dead body behind to be desecrated.|$|E
