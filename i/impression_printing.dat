50|$|Music {{engraving}} {{is the art}} {{of drawing}} music notation at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The first machine-printed music appeared around 1473, approximately 20 years after Gutenberg introduced the printing press. In 1501, Ottaviano Petrucci published Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, which contained 96 pieces of printed music. Petrucci's printing method produced clean, readable, elegant music, but it was a long, difficult process that required three separate passes through the printing press. Petrucci later developed a process which required only two passes through the press, but was still taxing since each pass required very precise alignment for the result to be legible (i.e., so that the note heads would be correctly lined up with the staff lines). This was the first well distributed printed polyphonic music. Petrucci also printed the first tablature with movable type. Tabulature is a form of music notation which indicates where on an instrument the player should play the notes, rather than indicating the notes. Single <b>impression</b> <b>printing,</b> in which the staff lines and notes could be printed in one pass, first appeared in London around 1520. Pierre Attaingnant brought the technique into wide use in 1528, and it remained little changed for 200 years.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cyanoacrylate}} (CA) as a fuming {{technique for}} the development of latent friction ridge skin impressions has been widespread for decades within the forensic lab {{as well as in the}} field at crime scenes. Important features of processing latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> using this method include that it makes visible latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> that for the most part cannot be seen with the unaided eye and it preserves latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> for future processing/examination. The superglue fumes "fix" the latent <b>print</b> <b>impression</b> to the substrate making it difficult to wipe away, thereby decreasing the chances of destruction during packaging at the scene, transportation, and processing in the lab. One of the disadvantages to this technique is the lack of contrast between the white polymers that are formed on the latent <b>print</b> <b>impression</b> residue and light colored backgrounds on which the latent <b>print</b> <b>impression</b> may be present. Attempts were made to develop a one-step cyanoacrylate fuming method that would enhance visualization of latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> on light colored backgrounds without the need for an alternative light source, dye staining, or powdering. Latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> were applied to black and white ceramic tiles, white painted wood and white/translucent textured plastic. Protein and hemoglobin stains, commercial colorants, sublimation dyes, hair dye, and printer ink were added to ethyl-CA in an attempt to create a co-polymerization process of the vaporized cyanoacrylate monomers and colorant molecules on latent print residue. Fuming was also attempted using pre-colored commercial glues with the assumption that the attached CA polymers on the latent <b>print</b> <b>impression</b> residue would retain their original color properties. None of these methods proved successful. The practical use of a new fluorescent CA, Lumicyano^TM, was also examined. Following fuming, an ALS is utilized for the excitation of the developed latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> using this technique. Strong fluorescence could not be observed on all substrates. In this particular study, fuming with traditional CA followed by the application of powder or dye stains to latent <b>print</b> <b>impressions</b> currently appears to be the most efficient technique for latent print enhancement on the white or light colored substrates used in this study...|$|R

Multiple unique <b>impressions</b> <b>printed</b> from a single matrix are sometimes known as a variable edition.

Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and viscosity of the ink used to create different prints.

Together with the description and evaluation of new realistic forensic casework driven score computation, we also exploit this experimental framework to show the importance of type attributes for minutiae in terms of its discriminating ability in forensic scenarios. We derive the conclusion that together with reliably extracted typical minutiae features, the presence of rare minutiae features helps to improve the measure of confidence of the forensic examiner at the ACE-V stage.

50|$|Printmaking is {{the process}} of making artworks by {{printing}} on paper and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an <b>impression.</b> <b>Prints</b> are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.|$|R

500|$|After its {{discovery}} {{the block}} {{was purchased by}} Mâconnais printer and collector Jules Protat (1852–1906), and {{came to be called}} [...] ("the Protat block"). [...] Jules Protat made some test prints on China paper, one of which he exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris. [...] The block is not in a state to withstand repeated printings, as three-quarters of the original has been lost to damage from humidity and insects; the reverse especially has not held up well, and is not in a condition suitable for making impressions. [...] The curator of prints at the National Library of France Henri Bouchot published a study on the block in 1902 called [...] ("An Ancestor of Wood Engraving"). [...] Though some contested his conclusions, Bouchot dated the work to the 14th century based on technical details such as the style of art, the Uncial script of the centurion's speech, and the costumes and weapons of the centurion and soldiers.

[...] An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an Allegory of Copulation where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench.
