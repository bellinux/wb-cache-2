25|$|During {{the golden}} age of hip hop, samples were heavily used. The ability to sample {{different}} beats, riffs and patterns {{from a wide variety of}} sources gave birth to a new breed of producers, DJs who did not necessarily need formal musical training or instruments, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> ear for sound collages. These samples were derived from a number of genres, ranging from jazz, funk and soul to rock and roll. For example, Paul's Boutique, the Beastie Boys' second studio album, drew from over 200 individual samples, 24 of which were featured on the last track of the album. Samples and sound bites were not limited to just music. RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, a hip hop collective formed in the 1990s, sampled sound clips from his own collection of 1970s kung-fu films to bolster and frame the group's gritty lyrical content. Many of the sample-laden albums released during this time would not be able to receive legal clearance today.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1979, Eaton started a feud with Chris Colt, {{designed}} to establish Eaton as more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> tag team competitor. The feud between the two was so heated that it saw Colt suspended for piledriving Eaton on the concrete floor, making it appear Eaton had been seriously injured. Eaton suffered no injuries, however. At that time, the piledriver was banned in most federations and treated as a move that could potentially paralyze a wrestler. This was done to give the move more [...] "shock value". Eaton conclusively defeated Colt, earning a place {{as one of the}} top faces (good guys) in NWA Mid-America. During 1979 and 1980, Eaton worked a series of singles matches against Dennis Condrey, a man he would later team up with to gain worldwide fame.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} great. He wrote that it felt [...] "more like a normal episode of the series" [...] compared to the premiere's [...] "introduction type" [...] tone. He also praised the prison experiment subplot, writing that it [...] "introduced a who's who of recognizable guest stars, all of whom could clearly rerun on a show that loves to build a large cast of periphery characters." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a positive review, writing [...] "Anytime Veronica goes undercover as her polar opposite is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time, you know? [...] And {{as much as the}} Stanford Experiment thing was low-stakes and standalone, I enjoyed its unpredictable twists and reveals. Perfect early season plotline." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote that the prison experiment plotline never getting [...] "out of hand [...] made it feel like a wasted opportunity" [...] while writing that [...] "Enrico Colantoni really sold Keith's despair at the resolution" [...] of his plotline.|$|E
500|$|Philip Andelman {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Lips Are Movin". It was filmed in Los Angeles. It premiered on Trainor's Vevo account on November 19, 2014. Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's me being sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time {{and trying to get}} through this feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme.

500|$|Issues {{that were}} {{mentioned}} in reviews regarding the game included its more casual gameplay compared to previous The Legend of Zelda games, {{which was not}} well received by some. GameSpy felt that the game was both easy and approachable enough for casual gamers to play, but sufficiently rewarding and challenging to satisfy hardcore fans of The Legend of Zelda series. IGN believed the game to be [...] "more casual than we'd like", but still found it captivating, entertaining, and [...] "a true adventure worthy of the Zelda name", calling it [...] "different, but it's still the real deal". GameTrailers stated that the short dungeon levels and hand-holding exploration are [...] "outright disappointing", but when comparing Phantom Hourglass to other Nintendo DS games, they conceded that it was still an impressive game, but <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> game when compared to The Legend of Zelda standards. 1UP.com {{pointed out that the}} biggest problem with Phantom Hourglass is that it falls back on using innovations from previous The Legend of Zelda games, rather than including new and original ideas: [...] "Innovation arrives in tiny steps, touch screen controls be damned." ...|$|E
500|$|Violent {{attacks on}} punk fans {{were on the}} rise. In mid-June Rotten himself was {{assaulted}} by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm.

A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start {{at the end of the}} month, was consequently delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed in front of the photographs making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika drawing. During the tour, a Swedish interviewer observed to Jones that [...] "a lot of people" [...] regarded the band as McLaren's [...] "creation". Jones replied, [...] "He's our manager, that's all. He's got nothing to do with the music or the image...he's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> manager." [...] In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: [...] "I don't understand it. All we're trying to do is destroy everything." [...] At the end of August came SPOTS—Sex Pistols On Tour Secretly, a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation.|$|E
500|$|Donna's {{relationship}} with Michael proved unpopular with critics. In an editorial discussing {{the boundaries between}} fiction and reality, The Guardian Scott Murray and Barney Ronay declared their love for Donna, commending the way she [...] "always has time for people" [...] and recommending that she stay away from Michael as she deserves better. Bree Treacy of RTÉ.ie believes that Michael had better chemistry with Donna than with his wife Annalese, however similarly commented {{that he did not}} deserve Donna, never having seen her as more than [...] "a notch on his stethoscope". Following her promotion to ward sister, Treacy hoped that the series producers would give Donna a man who would see her [...] "as more than <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time girl." [...] Simon criticized Donna for failing to observe correct organ donation protocol in an attempt to win Michael's affection, commenting that she had [...] "thrown her own heart willynilly at the first good-looking doctor she s with an ego the size of Texas." [...] She later branded her [...] "selfish to a fault" [...] for her negative reaction to Kieran's posting to Afghanistan, but opined that Kieran [...] "makes a far more suitable partner for her" [...] than Michael did.|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9.5/10, writing [...] "This wasn't <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> episode – it was great. It {{capitalized}} on absolutely every scrap of promise {{the show has}} had in its first nine episodes. Tell your friends and neighbors, they're probably {{going to want to}} tune in when this returns after the break. Not only that, but this episode heightens and improves every episode that has come before – as now all the pieces are important". Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete. Now, all the brains behind this could-be great show have to do is keep it up".|$|E
500|$|James Reed of The Boston Globe {{described}} [...] "Radio" [...] as fun, bouncy, {{and ideal}} {{for a night}} at the club.

Darryl Sterdan of Jam! was surprised by the new musical direction of Beyoncé but concluded that [...] "... you better believe it ... it kinda works". Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix described [...] "Radio" [...] as the most believable song on the album, and complimented its [...] "amid bland testaments to love's timeless endurance and the smut and thuggin of the 'Sasha Fierce' persona, [...] is one with sensual overtones sung to an electronic device that, unlike men, 'never lets me down'". Echoing Brockman's sentiments, Amy Linden of Vibe magazine, who wrote that 1980's electropop and the sleek Valentine music of [...] "Radio" [...] tells the story of Beyoncé's alter ego. Similarly, Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] "show [...] Sasha [...] <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> girl playing fierce". By contrast, Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Radio" [...] sounds like [...] "shameless target-marketing" [...] aiming at programming directors.

2500|$|Gregory {{recalled}} of {{his performance}} in the game, [...] "It {{was a good one}} for me today. Some of it was just the ball popping out and being {{in the right place at}} the right time.

[...] Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said of Gregory's recovery of the fumble, [...] "it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scoop-and-score play." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the change}} in public {{perception}} the band experienced after the song's release, Richards said in a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time, they're saying, 'They're evil, they're evil.' Oh, I'm evil, really? So that makes you start thinking about evil... What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how much people think of Mick as the devil or as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rock performer or what?

2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what have you, and it was more, at first, that it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> title for the seventh album, you know?

If the measure of greatness isn’t defined by absolute speed, pure efficiency or herculean payload, but of how well the design resonates with the intended buyer, the Vision Jet is both a great airplane and a significant one. It’s great because I think SR22 owners will swoon over this thing and significant because it represents a class of its own, expanding practical (if not cheap) jet ownership downward. At a typical invoice of $2.1 million, the Vision Jet is the least expensive jet out there and on a speed vs. dollars matrix, it more than holds its own against whatever competition {{it has in the}} low-and-slow tier, and that’s basically nothing in the turbojet category."

2500|$|Rick Leach {{rushed for}} 65 yards and {{completed}} 9 of 15 passes for 151 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. [...] With Illinois putting seven or eight men on the line at times, no Michigan player was able to rush for 100 yards in the game. [...] Accordingly, Michigan opened up the passing attack. [...] Bo Schembechler said after the game, [...] "When they put that many people on the line of scrimmage, you have {{to throw the ball}} over their heads." [...] In addition to the touchdown pass to Lytle, Leach connected with tight end Mark Shmerge in the second quarter for a seven-yard touchdown pass. [...] Jim Smith also caught six passes for 127 yards. [...] Leach's two touchdown passes gave him 13 for the season, tying the Michigan record set in 1947 by Bob Chappuis.
