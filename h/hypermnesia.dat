Two suggestions have been offered to explain the increases in net recall over testing. One suggestion is that pictures and high imagery words enhance <b>hypermnesia,</b> speculating that this nature of stimuli is more recognizable and hence less susceptible to forgetting.

50|$|Reminiscence is the remembering {{again of}} the {{forgotten}} without re-learning, a gradual process of improvement in the capacity to revive past experiences. Simply put, it is the act of remembering information on a later test {{that could not be}} remembered on an earlier test. Ballard coined the term reminiscence in 1913 when he conducted a study asking young school children to memorize poetry. He found that over successive recalls, the children would often recall new lines of poetry that they failed to recall previously. The concept of reminiscence can be applied in treatment settings for patients with memory impairment. Reminiscence therapy involves the discussion of past activities and experiences with another person, utilizing tangible aids such as photographs to cue recall. This is normally used to assist dementia patients suffering from extreme memory loss. Reminiscence is also associated with one's own autobiographical memory, which is not evenly distributed through the lifespan. When left to recall their own self-memories, people over the age of forty experience a reminiscence bump, having a marked increase of memories from the period between ages fifteen and thirty. Reminiscence is required for the phenomenon of <b>hypermnesia</b> (an overall improvement in performance across tests) but <b>hypermnesia</b> is not required for reminiscence.|$|E

Overall order performance declined over tests {{under a variety of}} encoding conditions (pictures, words, and relational and item-spe-cific processing) and retrieval conditions (intentional and incidental learning). Although net performance dropped across tests, participants did show reliable order recovery (reminiscence) between tests. The implications of these data for general theories of <b>hypermnesia</b> and order are discussed. Often in our lives, we are asked a question that we are unable to answer correctly at that exact moment (e. g., who was your third grade teacher?) but, when queried a short time later, we are able to successfully answer the question (Ms. Calkins). This everyday phenomenon is termed reminiscence and can be defined as “the remembering again of the forgotten without relearn-ing ” (Ballard, 1913, p. v) or as remembering information on a later test that could not be remembered on an earlier test. <b>Hypermnesia</b> is related to reminiscence and is defined as an overall improvement in performance across tests. <b>Hypermnesia</b> occurs when more informa-tion is newly recovered on a later test than is forgotten between those tests—that is, when intertest recovery (reminiscence) exceeds intertest forgetting. It {{is important to note that}} rem-iniscence (recovery) is a prerequisite for <b>hypermnesia</b> (overall improvement in performance) but <b>hypermnesia</b> is not necessary for reminiscence. Research on reminiscence and <b>hypermnesia</b> has employed free recall, cued recall, and recognition to measure retention (e. g., Payne, 1987; Roediger & Challis, 1989).

40|$|Hypnotized {{subjects}} {{respond to}} suggestions from the hypnotist for imaginative experiences involving alterations in perception and memory. Individual differences in hypnotizability are only weakly related to {{other forms of}} suggestibility. Neuropsychological speculations about hypnosis focus on the right hemisphere and/or the frontal lobes. Posthypnotic amnesia refers to subjects' difficulty in remembering, after hypnosis, the events and experiences that transpired while they were hypnotized. Posthypnotic amnesia is not an instance of state-dependent memory, but it does seem to involve a disruption of retrieval processes similar to the functional amnesias observed in clinical dissociative disorders. Implicit memory, however, is largely spared, and may underlie subjects' ability to recognize events that they cannot recall. Hypnotic <b>hypermnesia</b> refers to improved memory for past events. However, such improvements are illusory: <b>hypermnesia</b> suggestions increase false recollection, as well as subjects' confidence in both true and false memories. Hypnotic age regression can be subjectively compelling, but does not involve the ablation of adult memory, or the reinstatement of childlike modes of mental functioning, or the revivification of memory. The clinical and forensic use of <b>hypermnesia</b> and age regression to enhance memory in patients, victims and witnesses (e. g. recovered memory therapy for child sexual abuse) should be discouraged...|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} effect is moderated by experimental design, affecting recall in within-subjects designs but typically not in between-subjects designs. However, N. W.

In addition, the generate condition but not the read condition produced <b>hypermnesia</b> (increased recall over tests). The present experiments demonstrate that semantic-based (semantic-associate and category-associate) generation tasks produce this pattern of results whereas nonsemantic (letter transposition, rhyme, word fragment) generation tasks do not. Thus, the emergent generation effect {{appears to be a}} byproduct of semantic elaboration rather than a direct product of generation. In addition, high- and low-imagery words produced equivalent <b>hypermnesia</b> and emergent generation effects, arguing against a mediating role for imagistic encoding.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to further examine the relationship between hyper-mnesia and order retention. The experiment examined free- and serial-recall per-formance while using more ecologzcally-valid stimuli (20 actions that might occur in a park-throwing a Frisbee, reading a newspaper, etc.) than are typically used in hyperrnnesia studies (i. e., words and pictures) Three successive free-recall tests revealed positive <b>hypermnesia,</b> whereas 3 successive serial-recall tests displayed no change in performance across tests. e frequently encounter situations in which we are prompted to remember information, but we are unable to access a correct response W at that moment; in such cases, we would report that we have forgotten the to-be-remembered information. Often, however, if we attempt retrieval at a later time, the information becomes accessible and we are able to provide an accurate reply. This common experi-ence is referred to as reminiscence and can be defined as the process of remembering "forgotten " material in the absence of re learning (Ballard, 1913). Experimentally, reminiscence can be revealed through the retrieval of items on later tests that were not recalled on initial tests. When there is an overall increase in retrieval performance across experimental tests, hyper-mnesia is present (Madigan & Lawrence, 1980; Payne, 1987; Roediger & Challis, 1989). That is, hypermne-instructed to remember all of the material. A sizeable quantity of items is used to prevent ceiling effects and to provide opportunity for recall performance to increase-a requirement for <b>hypermnesia.</b> Participants are usually told to expect one memory test so that they are surprised when they receive at least two more tests on the same material.

Participants were 62 undergraduate students from Edith Cowan University. A series of 40 pictures, five to a slide, were shown by overhead projector at the rate of 20 seconds per slide. There were no differences between groups for reminiscence, i. e. all groups recalled new items at delay. At immediate recall groups did not differ for the number of items recalled, however at delay the immediate stress delayed no stress group showed moderate <b>hypermnesia</b> and differed significantly from the other groups, who showed a decrease in recall. All groups made significantly more errors at delay, and there were no differences between groups for the number of errors made. In Experiment 2, participants were 65 metropolitan bank staff members assigned to the same experimental conditions as in Experiment 1, who were shown a series of 12 slides depicting a handbag snatch, at the rate of 5 seconds per slide. Stress was manipulated by time pressure and by emphasising the importance of accuracy. All groups showed reminiscence, but the stress at immediate recall groups showed significantly higher reminiscence than the no stress at immediate recall groups. There were no differences between groups for immediate recall, but the immediate stress groups remembered significantly more at delay (<b>hypermnesia).</b> The no immediate stress participants did not differ from immediate to delayed recall No differences between groups were found for overall errors. Separate chi-square analyses of errors for offender, victim and scenario at immediate and delayed recall showed that the stress at both recall group made significantly less errors about the offender at delay.

30|$|Inconsistent recall could {{reflect a}} number of {{established}} psychological phenomena. One possibility is that rememberers may {{be more willing to}} report memories that they are unsure about on later opportunities than on earlier ones. Such a shift in reporting policy would result in new details or new memories being included in later testimony (cf. Koriat & Goldsmith, 1996). Another possibility is that exposure to postevent information from another source leads to changes in testimony (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993), or that postevent information reminds the rememberer of forgotten aspects of the original event (Benjamin & Ross, 2011; Benjamin & Tullis, 2010; Tullis, Benjamin, & Ross, 2014). Yet another possibility is that reminiscence occurs simply because there is more cumulative retrieval time on later than on earlier retrieval attempts, an explanation Roediger and Thorpe (1978) proposed to account for <b>hypermnesia</b> (the enhancement of memory over multiple recall tests that is seen when reminiscence exceeds forgetting). None of these perspectives can also explain why details are sometimes reported and then omitted at a later date.|$|E

40|$|Summary. -In {{the present}} study, 72 college-age {{participants}} from an introductory psychology course viewed {{a series of}} 20 pictures depicting events surrounding a rou-tine activity, i. e., eating at a cafeteria; these pictures were presented either in a logical order, e. g., enter cafeteria, pick up tray, stand in line, and select food, or in a random order. Three successive tests of free reconstruction of order indicated disparate effects of these conditions; random presentation produced significant forgetting of order in-formation across tests, whereas logical presentation produced no change in perfor-mance across tests. Whereas randomly presented stimuli produced both reliable inter-test recovery (reminiscence) and forgetting, neither result was observed following logi-cal presentation.

During the subsequent assessment of memory, new words and either previously cued words (Experiment 1) or previously uncued words (Experiments 2 A and 2 B) were presented against abackground mask. The subjects judged whether a word was old or new (direct ask) or whether the contrast between a word and the mask was high or low (indirect task).

In particular, with the continuous process of urbanisation of the countryside, an abstract ideal of the rural is often nurtured by our memories of how familiar places used to be. ‘The paradox of a culture which manifests so many symptoms of <b>hypermnesia</b> and which yet at the same time is post-mnemonic is a paradox that is resolvable once we see the causal relationship between these two features. Our world is hypermnesic in many of its cultural manifestations, and post-mnenonic in the structures of the political economy. The cultural symptoms of <b>hypermnesia</b> are caused by a political-economic system which systemically generates a post-mnemonic culture – a Modernity which forgets. ’[4] Cologni’s approach through her art intervention enters the texture of the memory construction process by establishing a dialogue with local residents and students, as well as building on documents of people’s experience and influence of the Gropius’s building in the 30 ’s and 40 ’s, when it was surrounded by orchards and the farm of the Chivers’ family. These found information give voice to a fictional character as Cologni’s alter ego: one of the 3000 women once employed here and coming to the Corridor Club at Impington. With these in mind Cologni’s body of work include these aspects in the exhibition: The archive material presented shows mnemonic lacunae, missing details about the people who came to work, study and live in Impington; A visualisation and materialisation of overlooked spaces for interaction in the Corridor Club revival; The sculptures as architecture off-cuts of unused spaces between the bay windows at the front of the Gropius building, occupying the space of a crouched body, are moved around the site, as from her drawings. Cologni’s response is symbolically in memory of all people whose nomadic way of living inevitably shows paradoxes like cherishing their memories, while also erasing part of them to make room for new ones in the encounter of a new place...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the eﬀects of eyewitnesses retellings and discussions with non-witnesses on the eyewitness memory and meta-memory judgments. In Study I, the eﬀect of eyewitness discussions with non-witnesses (persons {{who had not}} experienced the event) on eyewitness memory and meta-memory realism for the overall information about an event was investigated. The results suggest that discussions of an experienced event may reduce some of the beneﬁcial memory and meta-memory eﬀects caused by mere retellings, but may not have great negative eﬀects compared to a control condition. Analysis {{of the type of}} questions asked suggests listeners ask more about the peripheral details as compared with the central details. In a follow-up study to study I conducted a year later participants in the Retell condition no longer showed evidence of the memory and meta-memory beneﬁts evident at the original ﬁnal test after about 24 days. However, participants in the Retell condition recalled a higher number of correct items than participants in the Control condition. In Study II, the eﬀect of eyewitness discussions with non-witnesses on eyewitness memory and meta-memory realism for diﬀerent types of information was investigated. The diﬀerent types of information were Forensically central, Forensically peripheral, and Non-forensic information. These are types of information that the police may ask {{at the beginning of a}} crime investigation. The results from the two experiments showed that participants had better memory and meta-memory realism for Forensically central and Non-forensic information than for Forensically peripheral information. Moreover, participants in the four conditions were equally capable of distinguishing between correct and incorrect items. Further, in Experiment 1 participants in conditions involving retelling and discussing the event reported more total number and number of correct Forensically central items as compared to the Control condition. Study III investigated if retellings and discussions would cause more reminiscence and <b>hypermnesia</b> than mere retellings. The results showed that discussions indeed cause more reminiscence and <b>hypermnesia</b> over the ﬁve sessions as compared to mere retellings. The results also showed that the number of times a piece of in- formation was repeated over the sessions was associated with a higher probability for that piece of information being retrieved at the ﬁnal recall. Interestingly, if the information was retold or discussed in an earlier or later session did not predict if this information would be reported in the testing session or not. Last, the results showed that the forensically peripheral information, but not forensically central information was aﬀected by the reiteration eﬀect (i. e., the eﬀect that conﬁdence tends to increase when a person asserts the same statement many times). This may be due to the fact that the peripheral information was less integrated than the central information...|$|E
