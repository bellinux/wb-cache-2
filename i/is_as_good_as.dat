5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced {{to get into a}} fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E

60|$|Sharp {{was a man}} of what {{is called}} high {{standing}} in the community. That is, his word in a trade <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> any man's; his check <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> so much cash, and so regarded; he went to church regularly; went in good society and owed no man anything.|$|R

25|$|The {{summit is}} a short rocky ridge with a cairn at each end, the {{northern}} one being higher. The view from Harrison Stickle <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the view of it — a surprisingly rare occurrence — {{with all of the}} major fell groups visible.|$|E
25|$|Some {{preparations}} such as nasal sprays and inhalers {{may result}} in a rapid response, but the fast onset of high blood levels may compromise safety. In addition, the expense of some of these appliances may greatly reduce their cost-effectiveness. In children it is unclear if intranasal fentanyl <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> or the same as morphine.|$|E
25|$|Chiropractors often {{argue that}} this {{education}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> or better than medical physicians', but most chiropractic training is confined to classrooms with much time spent learning theory, adjustment, and marketing. The fourth year of chiropractic education persistently showed the highest stress levels. Every student, irrespective of year, experienced different ranges of stress when studying. The chiropractic leaders and colleges have had internal struggles. Rather than cooperation, there has been infighting between different factions. A number of actions were posturing due to the confidential nature of the chiropractic colleges {{in an attempt to}} enroll students.|$|E

25|$|Darine contrives a ruse to win Sir Ethais's love. She {{tells him}} that Sir Phyllon had accused him of exaggerating the {{severity}} of his wound, {{so that he could}} avoid fighting again. Sir Ethais is outraged at being called a coward, and wants to challenge Sir Phyllon if he ever recovers. Darine {{tells him that}} she has the cure, but she will give it to him only if he promises to love her. Sir Ethais agrees, and observing that one beautiful woman <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> another, gives Selene's ring to Darine. He takes the potion, and is cured. Sir Phyllon enters, and Sir Ethais accosts him. Their argument escalates, and Sir Ethais turns to Darine to confirm that Sir Phyllon had accused him of cowardice. Darine admits that this was only an artifice. Sir Ethais asks Sir Phyllon's forgiveness and renounces Darine. She implores him to reconsider.|$|E
25|$|The {{method used}} to read NANDflash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as read disturb. The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the block pool. The original block <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> new after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

500|$|The LG G2 was {{released}} to mostly positive reception. In December 2013, the British magazine Stuff named the G2 its 2013 Phone of the Year and Gadget of the Year, reporting that [...] "LG has previously {{struggled to make}} an impact on the smartphone market, but the LG G2 <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> smartphones get in 2013, and shows the established names how it should be done." ...|$|E

500|$|In their {{review of}} the game, Official Nintendo Magazine commented that the {{stylus-controlled}} cooking tutorials are not user-friendly, and the recipe sharing <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> it could be since players can only use ingredients and methods from recipes that they have unlocked through playing the game. They felt that the game attempts to appeal to gamers rather than aspiring chefs, concluding, [...] " [...] some great recipes but the experience is marred by some fiddly cooking games." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Brown, who was Editor of Highlights for Children, [...] "Without Goofus, Gallant {{would be}} bland {{and no one}} would pay attention. But kids see parts of {{themselves}} in both characters. No one <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> Gallant, and no one is as bad as Goofus. But being more like Gallant is something to strive for." [...] For many years, a short line of text reading [...] "Gallant shows correct behavior" [...] was included {{at the bottom of the}} comic.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} week {{following}} its release, A Thousand Splendid Suns sold over one million copies, becoming a number-one New York Times bestseller for fifteen weeks. Time magazine's Lev Grossman placed it at number three in the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, and praised it as a [...] "dense, rich, pressure-packed guide to enduring the unendurable." [...] Jonathan Yardley said in the Washington Post [...] "Book World", [...] "Just in case you're wondering whether Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> The Kite Runner, here's the answer: No. It's better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first line}} of the third verse allude to a {{definitive}} moment with the cryptic reference to God: [...] "Now when you work it out, I'm worse than you/Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to/Now, when you work out where to draw the line/Your guess <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> mine." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God gave you style and gave you grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had". When the song is performed live, guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put a Smile on Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> mine.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the race, which {{experienced}} a record 16cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, [...] "A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied {{to so much}} history.

[...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, {{trying to get the}} (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that– he's got that spark, you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|On July 20, Hornsby {{appeared}} {{in what would}} be his final game, a 5–4 loss to the Yankees. A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place {{at the time of}} his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes. On July15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a horse race. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, [...] "The money <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the money you take from people in the loan-shark business. It's better than taking interest from widows and orphans... "; that made his release five days later an easy decision for Barnes. Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a [...]321batting average and 18hits in 20games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.|$|E
