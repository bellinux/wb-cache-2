40|$|One of the {{concepts}} for oxygen production from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide {{involves the use of}} tubular electrochemical membranes for oxygen separation. The tubular configuration offers the advantage of being able to separate the oxygen at pressures of up to 500 psi, thereby eliminating the need for a pre-liquefaction oxygen compressor. A key technology that has to be developed in order for the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>separator</b> to combine as a compressor is a high temperature static seal between the ceramic separation cell and the nickel-based super-alloy tube. Equipment was designed and fabricated to test the seals. Efforts are under way to develop a finite element model to study the thermal stresses at the joints and on the seal, and the optimal shape of the seal. The choice of seal materials and the technique to be used to fabricate the seals are also being investigated...|$|E
40|$|The study {{describes}} a closed ecosystem concept that includes electrochemical CO 2 and O 2 separators and a moisture condenser/separator for maintaining CO 2, O 2, and humidity {{levels in the}} crew and plant habitats at their respective optimal conditions. The key processes of this concept are aqueous electrolyte-based electrochemical CO 2 and O 2 separations. The principles and cell characteristics of these electrochemical gas separation processes are described. Also presented are descriptions of test hardware and the test results of the <b>Electrochemical</b> CO 2 <b>Separator</b> (ECS) and the <b>Electrochemical</b> O 2 <b>Separator</b> (EOS), and {{the combination of the}} ECS and the EOS. The test results proved that the ECS and EOS processes for the combined concept are viable...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{process for}} the separation of hydrogen sulfide from coal gasification product streams through electrochemical membrane is being developed. H 2 S {{is removed from the}} syngas stream, split into hydrogen, with the existing syngas, and sulfur. Past experiments dealt with removal of 1 - 2 % H 2 S from gases containing only H 2 S, nitrogen, and simulated coal gas. The most recent experiments evaluated the polishing application using <b>Electrochemical</b> Membrane <b>Separator.</b> Removal efficiencies of over 90 % were achieved...|$|R
40|$|A high {{temperature}} electrochemical cell capable of polishing hydrogen sulfide from fuel gas streams is being perfected. The operation, {{to be used}} in compliance with high efficiency energy conversion systems, takes advantage of an electrochemical potential gradient instead of typical separation techniques to separate hydrogen sulfide from the fuel gas stream leaving hydrogen to enrich the exiting gases. Vaporous sulfur is the by-product carried downstream by a separate inert sweep gas and condensed. Work continued this quarter to improve experimental conditions (laboratory and equipment enhancement). The oven containing the <b>Electrochemical</b> Membrane <b>Separator</b> (EMS) is the main focus of improvement readjusting spatial requirements conforming to the controlled environmental emissions equipment while creating a controlled atmosphere gauntlet to unfavorable reactions with electrolytic species. Manufacturing of yttria-stabilized zirconia matrices was the primary focus of laboratory experimentation while full-cell testing is not possible...|$|R
40|$|An <b>electrochemical</b> nitrogen-hydrogen <b>separator</b> {{subsystem}} {{was investigated}} for use following catalytic dissociation of ammonia or hydrazine in a storage system {{being considered for}} long-duration manned space flight. An experimental cell with concentric tubular Pd- 25 Ag alloy hydrogen diffusion electrodes and hermetically sealed aqueous caustic electrolyte was developed. It was found that this cell operated satisfactorily at 210 C to 245 C and produced dry nitrogen and dry hydrogen with either or both gases at pressures up to 6. 8 atmospheres (100 psia) or higher for storage. The final cell developed was operated satisfactorily for 176 days (4200 hours) with no evidence of deterioration of current-voltage performance. The best experimental performance was obtained at 245 C at currents up to 4 amperes (180 ma/sq cm and 360 ma/sq cm anode and cathode current densities, respectively) with a maximum steady-state cell voltage of 0. 125 volt for an anode feed of pure hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|In an {{endeavour}} {{to improve}} {{not only the}} thermal shrinkage but also the <b>electrochemical</b> performance of <b>separators</b> in lithium-ion batteries, a novel composite separator is developed, i. e., a close-packed SiO 2 /poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) binary nanoparticles-coated polyethylene (PE) separator. The introduction of SiO 2 nanoparticles to the coating layer effectively suppresses thermal shrinkage of the composite separator. In contrast to a SiO 2 /PMMA coating layer having a film-shaped PM MA binder, the SiO 2 /PMMA binary nanoparticle coating layer employs PMMA particles as a binder. As a consequence, a highly porous structure. i. e., well-connected interstitial voids, is formed between the binary SiO 2 and PMMA nanoparticles. The unique porous morphology allows favourable liquid electrolyte wettability and facile ionic conduction, which {{play a crucial role}} in improving cell performance such as the discharge capacity and the C-rate capability of the composite separator. close 453...|$|R
30|$|Electrode {{material}} for supercapacitor fabrication was prepared using activated carbon (AC) derived from areca fibres [34] using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (3 : 1 ratio). PVDF binder solution was mixed with AC in 0.3 : 1 weight ratio and grinded {{by means of}} pestle and mortar to form slurry. The obtained slurry was screen printed (200  µm mesh size) on two stainless steel electrodes. The thicknesses of the coated AC layer on electrodes were around 30  µm having weight of ~ 2 to 3  mg each. The supercapacitor cell was constructed using SPE sandwiched between two prepared AC-coated electrodes. The unit cell was sealed in a plastic-coated aluminium pouch keeping the two wires outside. We also fabricated a cell with 2  mol dm− 3 H 2 SO 4 solution without SPE using polypropylene sheet as <b>separator.</b> <b>Electrochemical</b> characterization {{was carried out by}} CV, AC impedance and GCD studies. All the electrochemical studies were carried out using a BioLogic SP- 150 instrument.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{process for}} the separation of hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from coal gasification product streams through an electrochemical membrane is being developed. H{sub 2 }S {{is removed from the}} syn-gas stream, split into hydrogen, which enriches the exiting syn-gas, and sulfur, which is condensed from an inert sweep gas stream. The process allows removal of H{sub 2 }S without cooling the gas stream and with negligible pressure loss through the separator. The process is made economically attractive by the lack of need for a Claus process for sulfur recovery. To this extent the project presents a novel concept for improving utilization of coal for more efficient power generation. Past experiments using this concept dealt with identifying removal of 1 [...] 2 % H{sub 2 }S from gases containing only H{sub 2 }S in N{sub 2 }, simulated natural gas, and simulated coal gas. Data obtained from these experiments resulted in extended studies into electrode kinetics and electrode stability in molten melts. The most recent experiments evaluated the polishing application (removal Of H{sub 2 }S below 10 ppm) using the <b>Electrochemical</b> Membrane <b>Separator</b> (EMS). H{sub 2 }S removal efficiencies over 90 % were achieved at these stringent conditions of low H{sub 2 }S concentrations proving the technologies polishing capabilities. Other goals include optimization of cell materials capable of improving cell performance. Once cell materials are defined, cell experiments determining maximum removal capabilities and current efficiencies will be conducted. Also, a model theoretically describing the preferred reduction of H{sub 2 }S, the transport of S{sup 2 {minus}}, and the competing transport of CO{sub 2 } will be investigated. The model should identify the maximum current efficiency for H{sub 2 }S removal, depending on variables such as flow rate, temperature, current application, and the total cell potential...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Electrochemical</b> Membrane <b>Separator</b> (E. M. S.), {{the focus}} of {{experimental}} work, purges a fuel gas contaminated with H{sub 2 }S. This is done by reducing the most electro-active species in the gas stream. In this case, H{sub 2 }S is reduced by the following: H{sub 2 }S + 2 e{sup -} {yields} H{sub 2 } + S{sup 2 -}. A membrane which contains sulfide ions in a molten salt electrolyte will act to transport the ions across to the anode. If the membrane is impermeable to H{sub 2 } diffusion from the cathode side, an inert sweep gas {{can be used to}} carry the vaporous oxidized sulfur downstream to be condensed. S{sup 2 -}{yields} 1 / 2 S{sub 2 } + 2 e{sup -}. Processes to remove H{sub 2 }S typically rely on low-to-ambient temperature adsorption, followed by sorbent regeneration and Claus plant treatment for conversion of H{sub 2 }S to a salable by-product, sulfur. Although effective, this type of removal is very process- intensive as well as energy-inefficient due to low temperature operation. Gasification streams generally range from 500 {degrees}C - 1000 {degrees}C, requiring cooling before and reheating after process gas sweetening. Although these technologies have proven capable of meeting H{sub 2 }S levels required by molten carbonate fuel cell systems, there are several disadvantages inherent to these processes. Alternative high temperature methods are presently available, but process drawbacks including morphological changes in catalytic beds or inefficient molten salt sorbent processes negate savings incurred through energy efficient removal temperatures. An electrochemical membrane separation system for removing H{sub 2 }S from coal gasification product streams {{is the subject of this}} investigation. The high operating temperature, flow-through design, and capability of selective H{sub 2 }S removal and direct production of elemental sulfur offered by this process provide several advantages over existing and developmental H{sub 2 }S removal technologies. 17 refs., 21 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a new technique for blending of electrolyte-binder (separator) mixes for use in thermal batteries is described. The original method of blending such materials at Sandia involved liquid Freon TF' as a medium. The ban {{on the use of}} halogenated solvents throughout much of the Department of Energy complex required the development of an alternative liquid medium as a replacement. The use of liquid nitrogen (LN) was explored and developed into a viable quality process. For comparison, a limited number of dry-blending tests were also conducted using a Turbula mixer. The characterization of pellets made from LN-blended separators involved deformation properties at 530 C and electrolyte-leakage behavior at 400 or 500 C, as well as performance in single-cells and five-cell batteries under several loads. Stack-relaxation tests were also conducted using 10 -cell batteries. One objective of this work was to observe if correlations could be obtained between the mechanical properties of the separators and the performance in single cells and batteries. Separators made using three different electrolytes were examined in this study. These included the LiCl-KCl eutectic, the all-Li LiCl-LiBr-LiF electrolyte, and the low-melting LiBr-KBr-LiF eutectic. The <b>electrochemical</b> performance of <b>separator</b> pellets made with LN-blended materials was compared to that for those made with Freon T P and, in some cases, those that were dry blended. A satisfactory replacement MgO (Marinco 'OL', now manufactured by Morton) was qualified as a replacement for the standard Maglite 'S' MgO that has been used for years but is no longer commercially available. The separator compositions with the new MgO were optimized and included in the blending and electrochemical characterization tests...|$|R
