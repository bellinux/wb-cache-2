In this paper, the focus will be entirely on the control of the displacement of the variable 28 cc <b>Floating</b> <b>Cup</b> pump (FCVP 28). The <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> principle features two opposed swash plates, for which both angular positions need to be controlled in order to cover the entire range from zero to full displacement. The results of both extended numerical analysis as well as simplified linearized models will be compared to test results on a 28 cc FCVP. Special emphasis will be on the dynamic behaviour of the displacement control...|$|R
40|$|A morphometric {{study of}} the {{proximal}} radius was performed with computed tomography scanning in 51 healthy adults. These dimensions were then {{compared with those of}} a commercially available floating radial head prosthesis. Results were expressed as mean values, SD, and minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum diameters of the radial head were 21. 9 +/- 1. 9 mm and 22. 9 +/- 1. 9 mm, respectively. The minimum and maximum intramedullary diameters of the radial neck were 8. 3 +/- 1. 3 mm and 9. 3 +/- 1. 5 mm, respectively. The combined length of the radial head and neck was 22. 47 +/- 2. 84 mm. The implications for prosthetic design are as follows: the small <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> (19 mm in diameter) is too small for the large majority of adults, the large <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> (22 mm in diameter) is closer to the radial anatomy, the mean values are significantly different between male and female patients, and a single component would suffice for right and left elbows.

40|$|The <b>Floating</b> <b>Cup</b> Displacement {{principle}} {{is a relatively}} new axial piston displacement principle for hydrostatic pumps, motors and transformers. Since its origin in 2001, it has been mainly applied in fixed displacement pump prototypes. At the SICFP’ 05, a design for a variable displacement open circuit <b>Floating</b> <b>Cup</b> Pump was presented. Now, the first prototype of a 28 cm 3 unit based on this design, has been built. This papers reports the first efficiency measurements of this prototype. So far, the unit has been tested at 100 % and 50 % swash angle. The total efficiencies at these swash angles are already quite good, even if no design loops have been made yet. The paper further describes a new method to separate the losses in this unit over the different loss mechanisms. This method is used to distill the mechanical torque losses from the measurements. An inverse version of this method is then used to predict the total efficiencies of this unit at 25 % and 75 % swash angles...|$|R

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid drive line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic drive lines in which four constant displacement <b>Floating</b> <b>Cup</b> (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel drive hydrid drive line with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel drive line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel drive line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid drive lines are given...|$|R

5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> nest on an open lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|R

40|$|The Tower is an {{official}} {{publication of the}} Georgia Tech Board of Student Publications and {{is sponsored by the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program and the Price Gilbert Memorial Library System. This article is from Volume 2. The objective of the research is to address the power density issue of electric hybrids and energy density issue of hydraulic hybrids by designing a drive system. The drive system will utilize new enabling technologies such as the INNAS <b>Floating</b> <b>Cup</b> pump/pump motors and the Toshiba Super Charge Ion Batteries (SCiB). The proposed architecture initially included a hydraulic-electric system, where the high power braking power is absorbed by the hydraulic system while energy is slowly transferred from both the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) drive train and the hydraulic drive train to the electric accumulator for storage. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the control method for the hydraulic system with in-hub pump motors. Upon preliminary analysis it is concluded that the electric system alone is sufficient. The final design is an electric system that consists of four in-hub motors. Analysis is performed on the system and MATLAB Simulink is used to simulate the full system. It is concluded that the electric system has no need for a frictional braking system if the Toshiba SCiBs were used. The regenerative braking system will be able to provide an energy saving from 25 % to 30 % under the simulated conditions.

Due to the variety of curves in the channel, the speed the wine cups transversed the course was influenced by the shape of the cup, rate of the water flow and the level of the wine in the cup. Should the cup of wine reach the guest before he could submit a suitable subsequent line he must consume that entire cup of wine and try again, and again, until the task was accomplished.|$|R
40|$|The rising use of {{vehicles}} and herewith the yearly decrease in available amount {{of crude oil}} left on the earth accompanied by a continuously increasing price puts high stress on the vehicle industry. Furthermore, Humans face a growing increase in the global environmental pollution concerns and tough emission standards constrain the maximum amount {{of vehicles}} emission to reduce air pollution. All of these factors force automobile and vehicle manufactures into never-ending effort to satisfy these requirements. Hence, the development of new vehicles to further reduce fuel consumption and emission is a mandatory. The high power density of hydraulic pumps/motors and hydro-pneumatic accumulators make hydraulic technology look promising for vehicles' transmission and its integration in the automobile industry should be considered. Furthermore, a reasonable price, reliability and long life time of hydraulic units are good enough and required for this purpose. The recently developed hydrostatic units, that meet the increased requirements of high efficiency over a wide range of operation offer, new capability for hydrostatic drivelines in vehicle applications. This thesis primarily addresses the potential of hydraulic transmission for use in automobiles. The analysis and simulations assume baseline vehicle specifications and components of a mid-sized passenger car. Three hydraulic drivetrain configurations were investigated. A continuously variable hydrostatic transmission integrated with an engine controlled to operate on the ideal fuel efficiency line is first introduced. Then, a secondary controlled hydrostatic transmission equipped with conventional hydrostatic units and an energy recovering system working under engine on/off control strategy is also investigated. Alongside the above, an innovative series full hydraulic hybrid drivetrain, referred as “the Hydrid” and its key components are researched in detail throughout the thesis. The general architecture of the Hydrid was introduced by the Dutch organization Innas BV, replacing the mechanical transmission with a distinct series hydraulic transmission which includes innovative components such as a three port-plate hydraulic transformer, fixed displacement pump and in-wheel hydro-motors designed on the <b>floating</b> <b>cup</b> technology. A generic power management strategy of the system power flows is developed by rule based algorithm, and the most efficient power flow control for each driving pattern is established. Results of the drivetrains performance, fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions during a standard driving cycle are presented to evaluate the potential of each configuration to be applied in passenger cars...|$|R

6000|$|II. Indeed, so {{singularly}} unlucky {{were the}} British Fairies that, as {{has already been}} hinted, amid {{the wreck of the}} Gothic mythology, consequent upon the introduction of Christianity, they seem to have preserved, with difficulty, their own distinct characteristics, while, at the same time, they engrossed the mischievous attributes of several other classes of subordinate spirits, acknowledged by the nations of the north. The abstraction of children, for example, the well known practice of the modern Fairy, seems, by the ancient Gothic nations, to have rather been ascribed to a species of night-mare, or hag, than to the berg-elfen, or duergar. In the ancient legend of St Margaret, of which there is a Saxo-Norman copy, in Hickes' Thesaurus Linguar. Septen. and one, more modern, in the Auchinleck MSS., that lady encounters a fiend, whose profession it was, among other malicious tricks, to injure new-born children and their mothers; a practice afterwards imputed to the Fairies. Gervase of Tilbury, in the Otia Imperialia, mentions certain hags, or Lamiae, who entered into houses in the night-time, to oppress the inhabitants, while asleep, injure their persons and property, and carry off their children. He likewise mentions the Dracae, a sort of water spirits, who inveigle women and children into the recesses which they inhabit, beneath lakes and rivers, by floating past them, {{on the surface of the}} water, in the shape of gold rings, or cups. The women, thus seized, are employed as nurses, and, after seven years, are permitted to revisit earth. Gervase mentions one woman, in particular, who had been allured by observing a wooden dish, or <b>cup,</b> <b>float</b> by her, while washing clothes in a river. Being seized as soon as she reached the depths, she was conducted into one of these subterranean recesses, which she described as very magnificent, and employed as nurse to one of the brood of the hag who had allured her. During her residence in this capacity, having accidentally touched one of her eyes with an ointment of serpent's grease, she perceived, at her return to the world, that she had acquired the faculty of seeing the dracae, when they intermingle themselves with men. Of this power she was, however, deprived by the touch of her ghostly mistress, whom she had one day incautiously addressed. It is a curious fact, that this story, in almost all its parts, is current in both the Highlands and Lowlands of Scotland, with no other variation than the substitution of Fairies for dracae, and the cavern of a hill for that of a river.[A] These water fiends are thus characterized by Heywood, in the Hierarchie-- ...|$|R
