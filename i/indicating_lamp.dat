Results This study compared loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with conventional PCR as DNA-based diagnostic techniques for the early detection of schistosomal DNA and the evaluation of chemotherapy. The results showed that both PCR and LAMP assays targeting a 301 base pair (bp) sequence of the highly repetitive retrotransposon, SjR 2, amplified DNA from schistosomes but were unable to distinguish between schistosome species. LAMP and conventional PCR were shown to amplify the target sequence of the SjR 2 -pCR 2. 1 recombinant plasmid template with limits of detection of 10 - 4 ng and 10 - 2 ng, respectively, thus demonstrating the superior sensitivity of the LAMP method. Schistosoma japonicum DNA was detected in all serum samples obtained from the three experimental groups at 1 week post-infection by LAMP assay, while the rate of detection by conventional PCR ranged from 50 % to 66 %. The potential application of PCR and LAMP assays {{for the evaluation of}} artesunate and praziquantel chemotherapy was investigated. PCR was shown to be less sensitive for detection of schistosomal DNA in drug-treated rabbit sera than the LAMP method.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the usefulness of}} loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in detecting specific gene sequences of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). A total of 102 primer sets for LAMP was designed to amplify the IS 900, HspX, and F 57 gene sequences of MAP. Using each of two primer sets (P- 1 and P- 2) derived from the IS 900 fragment, {{it was possible to}} detect MAP {{in a manner similar to}} that used with nested PCR. The sensitivity of LAMP with P- 1 was 0. 5 pg/tube, which was more sensitive than nested PCR. When P- 2 was used, 5 pg/tube could be detected, which was the same level of sensitivity as that for nested PCR. LAMP with P- 1 was specific. Although only 2 Mycobacterium scrofulaceum strains out of 43 non-MAP mycobacterial strains were amplified, the amplification reaction for these strains was less efficient than for MAP strains, and their products could be distinguished from MAP products by restriction digestion. LAMP with P- 2 resulted in very specific amplification only from MAP, the same result obtained with nested PCR. Our LAMP method was highly specific, and the white turbidity of magnesium pyrophosphate, a by-product of the LAMP reaction, allowed simple visual detection. Our method is rapid, taking only 2 h, compared with 4 h for nested PCR. In addition, the LAMP method is performed under isothermal conditions and no special apparatus is needed, which makes it more economical and practical than nested PCR or real-time PCR.

Autophagy is induced by tamoxifen in breast cancer cells and may contribute to tamoxifen resistance. In this study, the significance of LAMP 3 for tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer was examined. The methods employed included use of clonogenic assays to assess the survival of MCF 7 breast cancer cells with LAMP 3 knockdown after tamoxifen treatment and of quantitative real-time PCR of LAMP 3 to evaluate its predictive value for first-line tamoxifen treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer. Results show that tamoxifen treatment of MCF 7 cells induced LAMP 3 mRNA expression. LAMP 3 knockdown in these cells increased tamoxifen sensitivity. Evaluation of expression of the autophagy markers, LC 3 B and p 62, after LAMP 3 knockdown showed increased expression levels, indicating that cells with LAMP 3 knockdown have a suppressed ability to complete the autophagic process. In addition, knockdown of autophagy-associated genes resulted in sensitization to tamoxifen. Next, tamoxifen-resistant MCF 7 cells were cultured. These cells had a sevenfold higher LAMP 3 mRNA expression, showed elevated basal autophagy levels, and could be significantly resensitized to tamoxifen by LAMP 3 knockdown. In patients treated with first-line tamoxifen for advanced disease (n= 304), high LAMP 3 mRNA expression was associated with shorter progression-free survival (P= 0. 003) and shorter post-relapse overall survival (P= 0. 040), also in multivariate analysis. Together, these results <b>indicate</b> that <b>LAMP</b> 3 contributes to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Tamoxifen-resistant cells are resensitized to tamoxifen by the knockdown of LAMP 3.

In the present study, {{the performance of the}} repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) -LAMP and human serum resistance-associated gene (SRA) -LAMP assays were evaluated using clinical specimens obtained from four male patients from Luangwa and Zambezi valleys in Zambia and Zimbabwe, respectively. Findings The cases reported in this preliminary communication were all first diagnosed by microscopy, through passive surveillance, and confirmed by both RIME-LAMP and SRA-LAMP. A good correlation between microscopy and LAMP was observed and contributed to staging and successful treatment of patient. RIME-LAMP and SRA-LAMP complimented each other well in all the cases. Conclusions Both RIME-LAMP and SRA-LAMP were able to detect Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense DNA in patient blood and CSF and hence confirmed HAT in the parasitaemic patients. Our study <b>indicates</b> that the <b>LAMP</b> technique is a potential tool for HAT diagnosis, staging and may be useful for making therapeutic decisions. However, no statistically significant conclusion may be drawn due to the limited sample size used in the present study. It is thus imperative to conduct a detailed study to further evaluate the potential of LAMP as a bedside diagnostic test for HAT. </p...|$|R
