5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star <b>formation</b> <b>rate</b> in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star <b>formation</b> <b>rate</b> around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E

Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin <b>formation</b> <b>rate,</b> overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.|$|E

The major influences on new firm <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> {{are found to}} be the regional proportions of manual workers and home ownership, and the change in the rate of regional unemployment in the preceding year.

40|$|We {{have tested}} some {{relations}} for star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> used in extra-galactic studies for regions within the Galaxy. In nearby molecular clouds, where the IMF is not fully-sampled, the dust emission at 24 micron greatly underestimates star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> (by {{a factor of}} 100 on average) when compared to star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> determined from counting YSOs. The total infrared emission does no better. In contrast, the total far-infrared method agrees within a factor of 2 on average with star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> based on radio continuum emission for massive, dense clumps that are forming enough massive stars to have the total infrared luminosity exceed 10 ^ 4. 5 Lsun. The total infrared and 24 micron also agree well {{with each other for}} both nearby, low-mass star forming regions and the massive, dense clumps regions...|$|R
25|$|Many {{factors may}} disrupt the {{equilibrium}} {{of a giant}} molecular cloud, triggering a collapse and initiating the burst of star formation that can result in an open cluster. These include shock waves from a nearby supernova, collisions with other clouds, or gravitational interactions. Even without external triggers, regions of the cloud can reach conditions where they become unstable against collapse. The collapsing cloud region will undergo hierarchical fragmentation into ever smaller clumps, including a particularly dense form known as infrared dark clouds, eventually leading {{to the formation of}} up to several thousand stars. This star formation begins enshrouded in the collapsing cloud, blocking the protostars from sight but allowing infrared observation. In the Milky Way galaxy, the <b>formation</b> <b>rate</b> of open clusters is estimated to be one every few thousand years.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of the scaffold material {{is perhaps the most}} important decision to be made. It must be biocompatible and biodegradable; in addition, it must be able to incorporate any physical, chemical, or biological cues desired, which in the case of some chemical cues means that it must have a site available for chemically linking peptides and other molecules. The scaffold materials chosen for nerve guidance conduits are almost always hydrogels. The hydrogel may be composed of either biological or synthetic polymers. Both biological and synthetic polymers have their strengths and weaknesses. It {{is important to note that}} the conduit material can cause inadequate recovery when (1) degradation and resorption rates do not match the tissue <b>formation</b> <b>rate,</b> (2) the stress-strain properties do not compare well to those of neural tissue, (3) when degrading swelling occurs, causing significant deformation, (4) a large inflammatory response is elicited, or (5) the material has low permeability.|$|E
500|$|Thus {{the product}} <b>formation</b> <b>rate</b> {{depends on the}} enzyme {{concentration}} {{as well as on}} the substrate concentration, the equation resembles a bimolecular reaction with a corresponding pseudo-second order rate constant [...] This constant is a measure of catalytic efficiency. The most efficient enzymes reach a [...] in the range of [...] These enzymes are so efficient they effectively catalyse a reaction each time they encounter a substrate molecule and have thus reached an upper theoretical limit for efficiency (diffusion limit); and are sometimes referred to as kinetically perfect enzymes.|$|E

We do not see any evidence for AGN activity influencing these relations. We also {{investigate the}} influence of the very local environment on star-formation activity by counting neighbours within 30 kpc radius. This shows that galaxies with two or more close neighbours have on average significantly lower star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> as well as lower specific star <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> up to z 2. 5. We suggest that this might be due to star formation quenching induced by galaxy merging processes. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|This {{review is}} based on ca. 250 publications, from which 92 {{published}} data on the temporal and spatial variation of the concentration of small ions (− 3 . However, concentrations up to 5000 cm− 3 have been observed. The results are in agreement with observations of ion production rates in the atmosphere. Concentrations of small ions increased {{in the early morning}} hours due to night time inversion, which leads to accumulation of radon. We also summarised observations on the conversion of small ions to intermediate ions, which can act as embryos for new atmospheric aerosol particles. Those observations include the <b>formation</b> <b>rates</b> (J 2 [ion]) of 2 -nm intermediate ions, growth rates (GR[ion]) of sub- 3 nm ions, and information on the chemical composition of the ions.
