40|$|This paper {{presents}} modelling techniques with {{finite element}} method (FEM) for a composite beam subjected to combined negative bending and axial compressive forces. <b>Flexural</b> <b>behaviours</b> of composite beam were thoroughly analysed to determine the ultimate limit state due to vertical and axial compressive forces. Failure state of composite beam was revealed by the level of axial compressive forces and reduced negative moment due to axial compressive forces.

Reliability agreement has been observed between the results of FEM and experimental analysis on ultimate state behavior and failure modes. Detailed numerical techniques such as loading strategies in combined vertical and axial compressive directions and potential convergence problems due to complicated contacts between the material components are discussed in this paper.

40|$|Out-of-plane bending {{tests are}} here used to {{experimentally}} validate some numerical models of microbeams actuated by the electric field. Out-of-plane bending microcantilevers and clamped–clamped microbeams often suffer {{the presence of}} residual strain and stress, respectively, which affect their static and dynamic behaviour and pull-in voltage. In case of microcantilever an accurate modelling has to include the effect of an initial curvature due to microfabrication process, while in double clamped microbeams constraints may impose a pre-loading caused by a tensile stress. So-called geometrical nonlinearity sometimes occurs, when microcantilever exhibits large displacement, or because of the mechanical coupling between axial and <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviours</b> in double clamped microbeams. Modelling this kind of nonlinearity is an additional goal of this study. Experiments demonstrated a good agreement with results of FEM approaches proposed. In the case of microbridges numerical models are used to identify the residual stress.

The analysis is particularly extended into the post-peak stage with large inelastic deformation at various applied axial load level. The effect of axial load on their complete <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> is then identified based on the results obtained. The axial load is found to have fairly large effect on the <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of RC columns under both monotonic and cyclic loading.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} material and structural behaviour of a Steel-Fibre reinforced Reactive Powder Concrete (SF-RPC). The experimental program consisted of three phases. Phase 1 involved {{the development of a}} design mix for use throughout the remainder of the study. Phase 2 consisted of an in-depth investigation into the material properties of the mix. The final phase of the experimental component was the testing of 16 plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. Twelve beams were tested under short-term loading to determine their cracking and ultimate moment capacity. The remaining 4 beams were used to investigate the time-dependent <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of prestressed SF-RPC slabs. The material properties were measured using a range of short-term tests and included the compressive and <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour,</b> static chord modulus of elasticity and crack mouth opening. In addition to the short-term tests, investigation into the time-dependent material behaviour was undertaken and included the creep and shrinkage characteristics of the material. The response of the material to various curing conditions was also investigated. The structural behaviour investigated included the short-term flexural moment-curvature response and load-deflection behaviour of beams and slabs along with the crack patterns of both plain and prestressed SF-RPC members. In addition to the investigations into the short-term <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour,</b> a study into the time-dependent <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> was also undertaken. There are currently 2 available models for predicting the flexural response of plain and prestressed RPC cross-sections. The analytical phase of this investigation involved an evaluation of these models. Based on the experimental findings and analysis, a modified model was proposed for calculating the short-term <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of plain and prestressed SF-RPC beams. The applicability of an age-adjusted effective modulus method for calculating the time-dependent deformations of prestressed SF-RPC slabs under various levels of sustained loads was also evaluated and found to be adequate with minor refinements...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of lightweight oil palm shell to produce high strength lightweight sustainable material {{has led many}} researchers towards its commercialization as structural concrete. However, the low tensile strength of Oil Palm Shell Concrete (OPSC) has hindered its development. This study aims to enhance the mechanical properties and <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviours</b> of OPSC {{by the addition of}} steel fibres of up to 3 % by volume, to produce oil palm shell fibre-reinforced concrete (OPSFRC). The experimental results showed that the steel fibres significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of OPSFRC. The highest compressive strength, splitting tensile and flexural strengths of 55, 11. 0 and 18. 5 MPa, respectively, were achieved in the OPSFRC mix reinforced with 3 % steel fibres. In addition, the flexural beam testing on OPSFRC beams with 3 % steel fibres showed that the steel fibre reinforcement up to 3 % produced notable increments in the moment capacity and crack resistance of OPSFRC beams, but accompanied by reduction in the ductility...|$|R

Several knitted fabrics {{have been produced}} using polyester fibre blended, in different percentages, with functional fibres like Outlast, Dry release, Aquator, Polybutylene terephthalate and Bioactive. The drape and <b>flexural</b> rigidity <b>behaviour</b> of the materials produced have been evaluated to optimize the composition of functional knitted fabrics based on polyester/functional fibre blends. It is observed that the knitted fabrics produced with polyester/Outlast blends show the most interesting drape behaviour. On the other hand, polyester/polybutylene terephthalate and polyester/Aquator fabrics show lower drape behaviour due to the types of fibre used. Moreover, relationships {{between the amount of}} functional fibre and the drape and <b>flexural</b> rigidity <b>behaviour</b> are also established.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviours</b> of syntactic foam reinforced by warp knitted spacer fabric (SF-WKSF). Seven kinds of SF-WKSF samples were fabricated by warp knitted spacer fabric (WKSF) with structural parameters including surface layer structures, inclination-angle and fineness of spacer yarns, different microballoons types and contents. The flexural tests were carried out and the bending properties of SF-WKSF were analysed based on the strength and modulus values obtained from the test results. It is indicated that the SF-WKSF shows higher flexural strength and modulus compared to neat syntactic foam with almost no impact on the density of composites. The results also demonstrate that the surface layer structure, inclination-angle of spacer yarns, microballons content and type have significant effects on the flexural responses of SF-WKSF. The composites exhibit better antibending capacities by selecting larger inclination-angle, closer surface layer structure, higher density and relatively higher content of S 60 HS microballoons...|$|R

40|$|A recent {{technique}} for strengthening steel and steel-concrete composite structures {{by the use}} of externally bonded Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) sheets, to increase the flexural capacity of the structural element, is described. Several researches developed FRP strengthening of reinforced concrete and masonry structures, but few experimental studies about steel and steel-concrete composite elements are available. Some examples of guidelines for the design and construction of externally bonded FRP systems for strengthening existing metal structures are avail- able, but the method used to predict the <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of FRP strengthened elements is usually based on the hypothesis of elastic behaviour of materials and FRP laminate is mainly considered only under the tensile flange.

40|$|Abstract—Existing {{underground}} pipe jacking methods use a reinforcing rod in a steel tube to obtain structural stiffness. However, some {{problems such as}} inconvenience of works and expensive materials resulted from limited working space and reinforcing works are existed. To resolve these problems, a new pipe jacking method, namely PST (Prestressed Segment Tunnel) method, was developed which used joint to connect the steel segment and form erection structure. For evaluating the flexural capacity of the PST method structure, a experimental test was conducted. The parameters considered in the test were span-to-depth ratio of segment, diameter of steel tube at the corner, prestressing force, and welding of joint. The <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviours</b> with the effect of load capacity in serviceability state according to different parameters were examined [...] The frame with long segments could increase flexural stiffness and the specimen with large diameter of concave corner showed excellent resistance ability to the negative moment. In addition, welding of joints increased the flexural capacity. Keywords—PST method, Pipe jacking method, Flexural behavior, Prestressed concrete...|$|R

Because {{of the nature}} of kenaf fibres that have high water and resin absorption capability, the effect of drying process and compression process on <b>flexural</b> and tensile <b>behaviour</b> of kenaf fibre composite materials was studied. Different kenaf-epoxy laminates including wet kenaf-epoxy, dried kenaf-epoxy and dried and compressed kenaf epoxy were fabricated by using vacuum infusion process and compression. Stress-strain curve for tensile test and flexural stress-extension curve for three-point bending were plotted. As a result, it was found that by drying the kenaf fibres before laminating, the mechanical properties of laminate were improved, and by compressing the laminate after the vacuum infusion process, the excess absorbed resin from the laminate was removed and the mechanical properties of laminate were improved. These parameters have a big effect on the <b>flexural</b> and tensile <b>behaviour</b> of kenaf fibre composite materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided in three chapters, each one {{covering}} one topic. Initially, the thermo-mechanical and impact {{properties of materials}} used for back protectors have been analysed. Dynamical mechanical analysis (DMTA) has shown that materials used for soft-shell protectors present frequency-sensitive properties. Furthermore, through impact tests, the shock absorbing characteristics of the materials have been investigated proving the differences between soft and hard-shell protectors; moreover it has been demonstrated that the materials used for soft-shell protectors maintain their protective properties after multi-impacts. The second chapter covers {{the effect of the}} visco-elastic properties of the thermoplastic polymers on the <b>flexural</b> and rebound <b>behaviours</b> of ski boots. DMTA analysis on the materials and flexural and rebound testing on the boots have been performed. A comparison of the results highlighted a correlation between the visco-elastic properties and the <b>flexural</b> and rebound <b>behaviour</b> of ski boots. The same experimental methods have been used to investigate the influence of the design on the <b>flexural</b> and rebound <b>behaviours.</b> Finally in the third chapter the thermoplastic materials employed for the construction of ski boots soles have been characterized in terms of chemical composition, hardness, crystallinity, surface roughness and coefficient of friction (COF). The results showed a relation between material hardness and grip, in particular softer materials provide more grip with respect to harder materials. On the contrary, the surface roughness has a negative effect on friction because of the decrease in contact area. The measure of grip on inclined wet surfaces showed again a relation between hardness and grip. The performance ranking of the different materials has been the same for the COF and for the slip angle tests, indicating that COF {{can be used as a}} parameter for the choice of the optimal material to be used for the soles of ski boots. ...|$|R

40|$|New performance-based {{design codes}} are {{currently}} being developed, where the design life of reinforced concrete structures will be estimated by taking into account not only the time to initiation of reinforcement corrosion, but also the time {{it would take for}} the extent of corrosion to reach a level where the structure is no longer fit for purpose. It is therefore important to establish what level of corrosion, if any, can be permitted before the structural behaviour of the reinforced concrete member is affected. In this paper the effect of corrosion products on the bond strength and <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of reinforced concrete slabs was investigated. Pull-out tests confirmed that low levels of corrosion (less than 2 % loss in steel cross-sectional area) can result in improved bond between the reinforcing bars and the concrete. At higher corrosion levels the empirical bond decay functions proposed by various researchers accurately predict the bond strength. The <b>flexural</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the slabs is affected by the reduced bond between the steel and the concrete, and this manifests during the load tests in a {{reduction in the number of}} cracks but an increase in crack width, with increased corrosion levels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{time-dependent}} <b>flexural</b> cracking <b>behaviour</b> of {{reinforced concrete}} beams strengthened with externally bonded composite materials is investigated {{with a focus}} on the creep effects. A theoretical model is developed, which accounts for the creep of the different materials involved, and which also accounts for the time-dependent cracking and the tension-stiffening phenomenon. The deformability of the adhesive layer in shear and through its thickness, as well as its ability to transfer shear and vertical normal stresses, is considered in the model. The incremental governing equations are formulated via the variational principle of virtual work based on an incremental exponential algorithm for the creep modelling. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated through numerical examples including a comparison with test results available in the literature. The results show that creep causes a significant redistribution of the internal forces and the interfacial stresses at the adhesive interfaces with time, which should be carefully considered in the design of FRP strengthened members...|$|R
