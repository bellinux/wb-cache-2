5|$|The giraffe {{is one of}} {{only two}} living genera of the family <b>Giraffidae</b> in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. Their closest known {{relatives}} are the extinct deer-like climacocerids. They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn), belong to the superfamily Giraffoidea. These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deer.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} <b>Giraffidae</b> {{first appeared in}} the Early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23-10 million years ago), including Canthumeryx, Giraffokeryx, Palaeotragus and Samotherium. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium split into Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, another author J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of Palaeotragus. The okapi is sometimes referred to {{as an example of a}} living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium).|$|E
500|$|In 1901, Sclater {{presented}} {{a painting of}} the okapi before the Zoological Society of London that depicted its physical features with some clarity. There was much confusion regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a Helladotherium, or a relative of other extinct giraffids. Based on {{the description of the}} okapi by Pygmies, who referred to it as a [...] "horse", Sclater named the species Equus johnstoni. Subsequently, Lankester declared that the okapi re{{presented a}}n unknown genus of <b>Giraffidae,</b> which he placed in its own genus Okapia, and assigned the name Okapia johnstoni to the species.|$|E
500|$|The okapi ( [...] ; Okapia johnstoni), {{also known}} as the forest giraffe or zebra giraffe, is an {{artiodactyl}} mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. Although the okapi bears striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family <b>Giraffidae.</b> The okapi stands about [...] tall at the shoulder and has an average body length around [...] Its weight ranges from [...] It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs and white ankles. Male okapis have short, hair-covered horns called ossicones, less than [...] in length. Females possess hair whorls, and ossicones are absent.|$|E
500|$|The giraffe's chief {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family <b>Giraffidae,</b> {{along with its}} closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger {{in the west to}} Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through [...] "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.|$|E
50|$|The climacoceratids, namely {{members of}} what is now the type genus Climacoceras, were {{originally}} placed within the family Palaeomerycidae, and then within <b>Giraffidae.</b> In 1978, W. D. Hamilton erected a new family, placing it close to <b>Giraffidae.</b>|$|E

50|$|Samotherium ("beast of Samos") is an extinct genus of <b>Giraffidae</b> {{from the}} Miocene and Pliocene of Eurasia and Africa. Samotherium had two ossicones on its head, and long legs. The ossicones usually pointed upward, and were curved backwards, with males having larger, more curved ossicones, though, in the Chinese species, S. sinense, the {{straight}} ossicones point laterally, not upwards.

5000|$|Giraffa jumae is an {{extinct species}} of even-toed {{ungulate}} in the <b>Giraffidae</b> family. The species ranged from Malawi to Chad {{with a possible}} occurrence of the species or a closely related species found in Turkey. The type specimen was discovered during trenching excavations on the upper member of the Rawi Formation by Louis Leakey in the 1930s. [...] The specimen was found with Ceratotherium simum, Suidae such as Metridiochoerus andrewsi, a Hippopotamus gorgops, and a nearly complete pygmy hippopotamus mandible.|$|E
5000|$|Climacoceras (from Greek, [...] "Ladder Horns") was a genus {{of early}} Miocene {{artiodactyl}} ungulates of Africa and Europe. The members of Climacoceras {{were related to}} giraffes, as the genus was once placed within <b>Giraffidae.</b> Fossils of the two best known species of Climacoceras, C. africanus and C. gentryi have been both found in Kenya. The animals measured about 1.5 m in height and had large ossicones resembling antlers. C. africanus had ossicones resembling tall thorn-covered plant stems, while the ossicones of C. gentryi resembled thorny crescents.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} known members of this group, Palaeomeryx, {{was thought to be}} a hornless form distantly related to the <b>Giraffidae</b> before {{paleontologist}} Miguel Crusafont found remains of Triceromeryx in middle Miocene Spain. This Palaeomeryx-like form carried two ossicones over its orbits that were straight and short, similar to those of true giraffids. However, the most striking feature of Triceromeryx was the third, Y-shaped appendage that prolonged the occipital bone {{at the back of the}} skull. Discoveries during the 1980s and 1990s showed a surprising variety in these occipital appendages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Giraffidae</b> is {{a family}} of {{ruminant}} artiodactyl mammals that shares a common ancestor with deer and bovids. This family, once a diverse group spread throughout Eurasia and Africa, presently comprises only two extant genera, the giraffe (one species of Giraffa) and the okapi (the only known species of Okapia). Both are confined to Sub-Saharan Africa: the giraffe to the open savannas, and the okapi to the dense rainforest of the Congo. The two genera look very different on first sight, but share a number of common features, including a long, dark-coloured tongue, lobed canine teeth, and horns covered in skin, called ossicones.|$|E
5000|$|Pronghorn {{are unique}} when {{compared}} to their relatives. Each [...] "horn" [...] of the pronghorn is composed of a slender, laterally flattened blade of bone that grows from the frontal bones of the skull, forming a permanent core. As in the <b>Giraffidae,</b> skin covers the bony cores, but in the pronghorn it develops into a keratinous sheath which is shed and regrown on an annual basis. Unlike the horns of the family Bovidae, the horn sheaths of the pronghorn are branched, each sheath possessing a forward-pointing tine (hence the name pronghorn). The horns of males are well developed.|$|E

50|$|True horns have a bone core that {{is covered}} in a {{permanent}} sheath of keratin, and are found only in the bovids. Antlers are bony structures that are shed and replaced each year; they are found in deer (members of the family Cervidae). They grow from a permanent outgrowth of the frontal bone called the pedicle and can be branched, as in the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), or palmate, as in the moose (Alces alces). Ossicones are permanent bone structures that fuse to the frontal or parietal bones during an animal's life and are found only in the <b>Giraffidae.</b> Pronghorns, while similar to horns in that they have keratinous sheaths covering permanent bone cores, are deciduous.|$|E
