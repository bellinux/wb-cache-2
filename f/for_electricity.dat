5|$|Demand <b>for</b> <b>electricity</b> grows {{with great}} rapidity {{as a nation}} modernises and its economy develops. The United States showed a 12% {{increase}} in demand during each year {{of the first three}} decades of the twentieth century, a rate of growth that is now being experienced by emerging economies such as those of India or China. Historically, the growth rate <b>for</b> <b>electricity</b> demand has outstripped that for other forms of energy.|$|E

40|$|A higher {{percentage}} of energy from renewable resources is an important goal on many sustainable development agendas. In liberalized electricity markets, an increase in demand <b>for</b> renewable <b>electricity</b> can stimulate further investments in it, yet demand <b>for</b> renewable <b>electricity</b> has developed much slower than demand for other green products. So far, research has mainly examined the willingness to pay <b>for</b> renewable <b>electricity,</b> but limited {{research has been conducted}} to the motivations behind it. The concept of identity signaling has been proved to {{play a significant role in}} consumer behaviour for green products. However, (renewable) electricity in the Swedish residential market typically lacks two important drivers for idenity signaling: visibility and product involvement. A survey among Swedish households conducted for this study compares choices <b>for</b> renewable <b>electricity</b> under two scenarios, whereof one simulates a higher visibility of and involvement in electricity contracts. The results show that identity signaling has a positive effect on demand <b>for</b> renewable <b>electricity.</b> The results lead to implications <b>for</b> policy-makers, <b>electricity</b> suppliers and researchers...|$|R
