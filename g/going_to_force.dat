2500|$|At {{the start}} of preseason, Vancouver hoped to add six young rookies to the team. While the goaltending {{situation}} almost assured that one rookie would be added, forwards Hunter Shinkaruk, Brendan Gaunce, Nicklas Jensen, and Horvat were also attempting to make the team. Defenceman Frank Corrado was looking to secure a regular spot after he played the final three regular season, and four playoff games for the Canucks in 2012–13. When asked about adding youngsters to the line-up Tortorella stated: [...] "We’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> it, {{but we need to}} get some kids in our lineup." [...] In Vancouver's first preseason game Shinkaruk and Gaunce scored goals, while Läck stopped 25 of 27 shots in two periods of work. Vancouver lost the game 3–2 to San Jose as the Sharks out shot the Canucks 42–15.|$|E
2500|$|Fantino {{was criticized}} by lawyer Peter Rosenthal {{during the trial}} of {{aboriginal}} activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant's phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant [...] "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> me to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation" [...] and [...] "your whole {{world is going to}} come crashing down" [...] NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino's resignation accusing him of using [...] "pugnacious and bellicose" [...] rhetoric and for engaging in [...] "Rambo-style policing." [...] In the face of defence motions for the police to disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized {{for his role in the}} Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 1864, at the Battle of Dallas, {{there was}} at the center of Dawes's {{regiment}} a road leading to Lost Mountain which was left open. It was the evident to Dawes that the Confederates were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> their way through this road and capture the Union supply trains. Dawes ascertained the Union line could break at this point, so he rushed to the road just as the Confederate advance was within about 50 feet of the Union line which began to waver. During the melee of battle Dawes was struck by a Minié ball on the left side of his lower jaw. It tore off his lower lip and chin so that it hung down, removing almost all his lower teeth and cut his tongue. As he was carried off Dawes managed to scribe in the dust on the carriage floor, [...] "Good for a 60 day furlough?" [...] Dawes subsequently was honorably discharged on October 31, 1864. After months of suffering from this wound, Dawes had his jaw reconstructed by Dr. George Blackman, and finally was restored to health. Despite the serious wound to his jaw, Dawes later went on to become a gifted public speaker.|$|E

2500|$|In a February 2014 {{interview}} Greenwald said {{he believed}} he risked detention if he reentered the U.S., but insisted that he would [...] "force the issue" [...] on principle, and return for the [...] "many reasons" [...] he had to visit, including if he won a prestigious award {{of which he was}} rumoured to be the winner. Later that month, it was announced that he was, in fact, among the recipients of the 2013 Polk Awards, to be conferred April 11, 2014 in Manhattan. In a subsequent interview, Greenwald stated he would attend the ceremony, and added: [...] "I absolutely refuse to be exiled from my own country for the crime of doing journalism and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> the issue just on principle. And I think going back for a ceremony like the Polk Awards or other forms of journalistic awards would be a really good symbolic test of having to put the government in the position of having to arrest journalists who are coming back to the US to receive awards for the journalism they have done." [...] On April 11, Greenwald and Laura Poitras accepted the Polk Award in Manhattan. Although their entry into the United States was trouble-free, they traveled with an ACLU lawyer and a German journalist [...] "to document any unpleasant surprises". Accepting the award, Greenwald said he was [...] "happy to see a table full of Guardian editors and journalists, whose role in this story is much more integral than the publicity generally recognizes". On April 14, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service was awarded jointly to The Guardian and The Washington Post for revelation of widespread secret surveillance by the NSA. Greenwald, along with Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill, had contributed to The Guardian′s reporting.|$|E
2500|$|Ibn Qutaybah, a 9th-century Sunni Islamic scholar narrates of Ali:I am {{the servant}} of God and {{the brother of}} the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you. I shall not give {{allegiance}} to you [...] when it is more proper for you to give bay’ah to me. You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) – and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command? I now contend against you with the same argument…It is we who are more worthy of the Messenger of God, living or dead. Give us our due right if you truly have faith in God, or else bear the charge of wilfully doing wrong... Umar, I will not yield to your commands: I shall not pledge loyalty to him.' Ultimately Abu Bakr said, [...] "O 'Ali! If you do not desire to give your bay'ah, I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> you for the same.Ali's wife, and daughter of Muhammad, Fatimah, refused to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr and remained angry with him until she died due to the issues of Fadak and her inheritance from her father and the situation of Umar at Fatimah's house. This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Fatimah did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of Abu Bakr. Almost all of Banu Hashim, Muhammad's clan and many of the sahaba, had supported Ali's cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported Abu Bakr.|$|E
2500|$|He noted {{further that}} Hamas had removed {{significant}} sections of their constitution {{which called for}} Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East. [...] "In the past," [...] he said, [...] "it was said that we don't understand politics, only force, but we are a broad, well-grounded movement that is active {{in all areas of}} life. Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others." [...] Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament [...] "as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas [...] "would not go to foreign donors on [...] bended knee". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that [...] "The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of Hamas is a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any money that is given to us will be channelled to the correct path." [...] As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to [...] "... be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that we have built our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee of our existence. If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army." [...] Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that [...] "The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>force</b> people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. Hamas is contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda." ...|$|E

6000|$|So, you see, I {{told the}} lady the {{inevitable}} story. I was egotistical. I was selfish, no doubt; but I was natural, and {{was telling the}} truth. You say you are angry with a man for talking about himself. It is because you yourself are selfish, that that other person's Self does not interest you. Be interested by other people and with their affairs. Let them prattle and talk to you, as I do my dear old egotists just mentioned. When you have had enough of them, and sudden hazes come over your eyes, lay down the volume; pop out the candle, and dormez bien. I should like to write a nightcap book--a book that you can muse over, that you can smile over, that you can yawn over--a book of which you can say, [...] "Well, this man is so and so and so and so; {{but he has a}} friendly heart (although some wiseacres have painted him as black as bogey), and you may trust what he says." [...] I should like to touch you sometimes with a reminiscence that shall waken your sympathy, and make you say, Io anche have so thought, felt, smiled, suffered. Now, how is this to be done except by egotism? Linea recta brevissima. That right line [...] "I" [...] is the very shortest, simplest, straightforwardest means of communication between us, and stands for what it is worth and no more. Sometimes authors say, [...] "The present writer has often remarked;" [...] or [...] "The undersigned has observed;" [...] or [...] "Mr. Roundabout presents his compliments to the gentle reader, and begs to state," [...] &c.: but [...] "I" [...] is better and straighter than all these grimaces of modesty: and although these are Roundabout Papers, and may wander who knows whither, I shall ask leave to maintain the upright and simple perpendicular. When this bundle of egotisms is bound up together, as they may be one day, if no accident prevents this tongue from wagging, or this ink from running, they will bore you very likely; so it would to read through [...] "Howel's Letters" [...] from beginning to end, or to eat up the whole of a ham; but a slice on occasion may have a relish: a dip into the volume at random and so on for a page or two: and now and then a smile; and presently a gape; and the book drops out of your hand; and so, bon soir, and pleasant dreams to you. I have frequently seen men at clubs asleep over their humble servant's works, and am always pleased. Even at a lecture I don't mind, if they don't snore. Only the other day when my friend A. said, [...] "You've left off that Roundabout business, I see; very glad you have," [...] I joined in the general roar of laughter at the table. I don't care a fig whether Archilochus likes the papers or no. You don't like partridge, Archilochus, or porridge, or what not? Try some other dish.
