40|$|The main {{tenet of}} Likelihoodism is the {{so-called}} Law of Likelihood. In this note, I explain why the Law of Likelihood fails to undergird an adequate explication of <b>favoring.</b> 1. Some Background on the <b>Favoring</b> Relation This (brief) note is about the (evidential) “favoring ” relation. Pre-theoretically, <b>favoring</b> is a three-place (epistemic) relation, between an evidential proposition E and two hypotheses H 1 and H 2. <b>Favoring</b> relations are expressed via locutions of the form: E <b>favors</b> H 1 over H 2. Strictly speaking, <b>favoring</b> should really {{be thought of as}} a four-place relation, between E, H 1, H 2, and a corpus of background evidence K. But, for present purposes (which won't address issues involving K), I will suppress the background corpus, so as to simplify our discussion. Moreover, the <b>favoring</b> relation is meant to be a propositional epistemic relation, as opposed to a doxastic epistemic relation. That is, the <b>favoring</b> relation is not meant to be restricted to bodies of evidence that are possessed (as evidence) by some actual agent(s), or to hypotheses that are (in fact) entertained by some actual agent(s). In this sense, <b>favoring</b> is analogous to the relation of propositional justification — as opposed to doxastic justification (Conee 1980). In order to facilitate a comparison of Likelihoodist vs Bayesian explications of <b>favoring,</b> I will presuppose the following bridge principle, linking <b>favoring</b> and evidential support: • E <b>favors</b> H 1 over H 2 iff E supports H 1 more strongly than E supports H 2. 1 Finally, I will only be discussing instances of the <b>favoring</b> relation involving contingent, empirical claims. So, it is to be understood that “favoring ” will not apply if any of E, H 1, or H 2 are non-contingent (and/or non-empirical). With this background in place, we're ready to begin. 2. A Popperian Sufficient Condition for <b>Favoring</b> Here is an eminently plausible sufficient condition for <b>favoring...</b>|$|R
40|$|Different synonymous codons are <b>favored</b> {{by natural}} {{selection}} for translation efficiency and accuracy in different organisms. The rules governing the identities of <b>favored</b> codons in different organisms remain obscure. In fact, {{it is not known}} whether such rules exist or whether <b>favored</b> codons are chosen randomly in evolution in a process akin to a series of frozen accidents. Here, we study this question by identifying {{for the first time the}} <b>favored</b> codons in 675 bacteria, 52 archea, and 10 fungi. We use a number of tests to show that the identified codons are indeed likely to be <b>favored</b> and find that across all studied organisms the identity of <b>favored</b> codons tracks the GC content of the genomes. Once the effect of the genomic GC content on selectively <b>favored</b> codon choice is taken into account, additional universal amino acid specific rules governing the identity of <b>favored</b> codons become apparent. Our results provide for the first time a clear set of rules governing the evolution of selectively <b>favored</b> codon usage. Based on these results, we describe a putative scenario for how evolutionary shifts in the identity of selectively <b>favored</b> codons can occur without even temporary weakening of natural selection for codon bias...|$|R

40|$|This paper reconsiders the {{expression}} “economy of <b>favors</b> ” that became {{popular in the}} literature about postsocialist societies as shorthand {{for a variety of}} illicit practices such as bribery, kickbacks, nepotism, etc. It argues that <b>favors</b> can be singled out and considered in their own right from an anthropological point of view. <b>Favors</b> are carried out in economies that are mainly conducted in other ways—ways that are not <b>favors</b> at all. The paper suggests, based on materials from Russia and Mongolia, that <b>favors</b> are different from transactional exchanges. They are defined by their quality of gratuitousness and {{by the fact that they}} require the recipients to be personally chosen. Because neither of these are features of market economic practice, <b>favors</b> tend to be described in the literature as informal, corrupt, etc., but the suggestion here is that <b>favors</b> persist because they enable actors to enhance a sense of self-worth within relevant social circles; they are sources of esteem for “normal heroes ” in such life-worlds. Analyzing <b>favors</b> in the sphere of higher education, the paper also suggests that practical operation of <b>favors</b> in an increasingly commercialized and power-differentiated environment is also helpful for understanding how social networks are formed...|$|R
