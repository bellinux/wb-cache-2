5|$|Before each draft, an NBA draft lottery {{determines the}} first round {{selection}} order for the teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which means that a team could have more than or less than two picks in one draft. As a result of the various trades, the Minnesota Timberwolves had four draft picks in 1992 and 2006. The Timberwolves drafted Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick, tenth overall, in the 1989 NBA draft. In 1995, the Timberwolves picked <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett</b> fifth overall, who went on to be a 13-time All-Star. In 1996, the Timberwolves drafted Ray Allen fifth overall but was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks with a future first-round pick for the draft rights of Stephon Marbury.

5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett</b> as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to contemporary prep-to-pro players like <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett,</b> Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed at college {{for a full}} four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). He remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He {{was also the first}} player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.

5|$|On July 5, 2014, McGary {{signed with}} the Thunder and joined them for the 2014 NBA Summer League. On the first {{possession}} of his first NBA Summer League game, McGary issued a halfcourt pass for a lob slam dunk by Jeremy Lamb, highlighting the passing that he is known for. On October 8 during training camp, McGary fractured the second metatarsal of his left foot, causing him to be sidelined for an estimated six weeks. This occurred {{three weeks before the}} team's October 29 season opener and meant McGary was expected to miss the first 14 games of the season. After missing the first 14 games, he began to be a limited participant in practices. McGary debuted with the Thunder on December 14 with 4 rebounds and 3 points in 7:15 of play against the Phoenix Suns. Subsequently, McGary was sidelined for 23 weeks with periostitis (inflammation) in his left tibia. He returned from injury on February 2 as he appeared in just his second NBA game in a 104-97 win over the Orlando Magic. On February 8, in his third NBA game, McGary posted a double double with 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers, while energizing the crowd and team. Then on February 9, he posted a 17-point, 10-rebound double double against the Denver Nuggets. He was one of the finalists for NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month. On March 13, McGary made his first start against the Minnesota Timberwolves in place of an injured Serge Ibaka, scoring 12 points in 22 minutes. At power forward, his defensive assignment {{was supposed to have been}} <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett,</b> but Garnett sat out a third consecutive game and was replaced by fellow rookie (and former Michigan State rival) Adreian Payne who had replaced Garnett in the two previous games as well. McGary had made his first college basketball start against Payne's 2012–13 Michigan State team. On March 16, McGary established a new career high by nabbing 11 rebounds in his first 6 minutes of play before going on to post a double double with 13 rebounds and 12 points in 17 minutes against Dallas Mavericks. In the April 15 season finale against the Minnesota Timberwolves, McGary posted a season-high 4 blocked shots in just 14:54 of play. During his rookie and sophomore seasons, he had multiple assignments with Oklahoma City Blue, the Thunder's D-League affiliate.|$|E

25|$|In the Western Conference, {{the race}} was tight. Allen Iverson, {{formerly}} the seven-time East point guard starter, moved to Denver from Philadelphia, attracting votes from reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash.

Dirk Nowitzki, another player who analysts predicted that would be starting, was not able to muster enough votes to get over former MVP <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett's</b> 1,600,000, but was put in by coaches as a reserve and later added to the starting lineup by West coach Mike D'Antoni. Tim Duncan was also voted in as a forward. Carmelo Anthony, the star small forward for the Nuggets, was not voted in as a starter or reserve, contrary to earlier reports that head coaches from the conference would put him in the lineup despite being involved in a brawl, but was allowed as a reserve (because Carlos Boozer was injured).

500|$|Rodriguez {{has signed}} two record-breaking {{contracts}} {{over the course}} of his career. First, he signed a $252 million, 10-year contract with the Texas Rangers in December 2000 ($ inflation-adjusted from 2000 dollars). Sandy Alderson called the deal [...] "stupefying", while Sports Illustrated noted that Rodriguez's early salaries under the contract ($21 million) would be greater than the annual payroll of the entire Minnesota Twins team that year ($15.8 million). The deal was the largest sports contract in history, doubling the total value of <b>Kevin</b> <b>Garnett's</b> $126 million National Basketball Association contract (the previous record holder) and more than doubling Mike Hampton's $121 million contract, the previous MLB record which had been signed just days before. The Rangers later traded Rodriguez to the Yankees in exchange for Alfonso Soriano before the 2004 season, though they agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million outstanding on the contract. Despite this, he opted out of the remainder of his deal after the 2007 season and renegotiated a new $275 million, 10-year agreement with the Yankees, breaking his own record for the largest sports contract. Under this deal, Rodriguez also receives $6 million each if and when he ties the career home run totals of Willie Mays (660), Babe Ruth (714), Hank Aaron (755), and Barry Bonds (762), along with another $6 million for breaking Bonds' mark.|$|R
