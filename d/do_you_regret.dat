A handsome man matches them on their own ground, and they don't like that. 'We are so fond of our ugly husbands; they set us off to such advantage.' Oh, I don't report what they say; I speak the language in which they think.--Mr. Roylake, does it strike you that the Cur is a sad cynic? By-the-by, do you call me 'the Cur' (as I suggested) when you speak of me to other people--to Miss Cristel, for instance? My charming young friends, you both look shocked; you both shake your heads. Perhaps I am in one of my tolerant humors to-day; I see nothing disgraceful in being a Cur. He is a dog who represents different breeds. Very well, the English are a people who represent different breeds: Saxons, Normans, Danes. The consequence, in one case, is a great nation. The consequence, in the other case, is the cleverest member of the whole dog family--as you may find out for yourself if you will only teach him. Ha--how I am running on. My guests try to slip in a word or two, and can't find their opportunity. Enjoyment, Miss Cristel. Excitement, Mr. Roylake. For more than a year past, I have not luxuriated in the pleasures of society. I feel the social glow; I love the human family; I never, never, never was such a good man as I am now.

40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{have many}} <b>regrets</b> from last year? To answer that question, you might start searching your memory and accumulating evidence. But your answer might {{not depend on}} how many <b>regrets</b> <b>you</b> {{remember}}. Instead, it might depend on how easy it feels to remember them. People often {{think that they have}} a larger pool of experiences to sample from when remembering feels easy than when remembering feels difficult. Thus, the relative ease of remembering can give us a quick indication of how many experiences we have had. Do people also rely on this feeling when thinking about their regrets? Across 3 experiments, we asked people to remember easy or difficult numbers of regrets from the past year, and then to rate how much regret they had for that year. Contrary to our predictions and the literature, we found that people relied on both number and ease: after remembering a small but easy number of regretted experiences, they rated the past year as less full of regret than others who remembered a large but difficult number. This pattern of results remained even when we drew people’s attention to the ease or difficulty of remembering. These results add nuance to the published literature, and suggest that when we think about how many regrets we have, what matters most is quantity and missed opportunity...|$|R
