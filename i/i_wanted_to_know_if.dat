[...] One of Whitney's accusations was that Sherman, who he described as [...] "Michigan's manager," [...] had on October 6, 1895, while riding on a Chicago cable car, offered a Chicago Athletic Association player named Stevenson the sum of $600 to finish the season with the Michigan team. [...] Sherman denied Whitney's charge {{in an interview with the}} Chicago Daily Tribune:"Stevenson had said he expected to go to Michigan to take a law course, and it was naturally expected he would join the team. When the Michigan team went into training at Omena early in the season, it was expected Stevenson would join the team, and when it was learned he would play for the athletic association Baird, the manager, wrote to me to see him and find out if he was coming to Michigan.

40|$|I {{surveyed}} migrant songbirds at two recording stations {{located along}} coast of Lake Michigan from August to October. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the migrant birds avoided flying out over Lake Michigan. To do this I compared {{the number of}} birds flying over a station located near the shore and a station 3 miles inland from the coast. No difference {{was found in the}} number of birds passing between two stations. I also used weather data {{to see if there was}} any correlation between the weather and nights when birds were migrating. I found that birds prefer to fly on nights when the wind is from a favorable direction (in the fall this would be northerly winds) and blowing at low velocities. This correlation with wind suggests that birds do not fly on any nights but that they wait for these nights and this could have implications for management of wind farms in the region...|$|E

My thesis is focusing on consumers’ demand on a special Hungarian dairy brand the Cserpes LLC. I present the Business Model Canvas {{as a tool of}} my examination of the selected LLC. Since the product of my analyzed company is milk and dairy products I focused my research in this field. So that is why I examined the real demand for consuming milk and milk products especially from territorial and age view. After that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there is any need or demand for dairies in Hungary, and what is typical for them.

40|$|Why {{very rich}} inheritors {{accumulate}} so little wealth? 1 2 Chapitre 1. Why very rich inheritors accumulate so little wealth? The accumulation {{patterns of the}} very rich inheritors are critical {{to the understanding of}} the interaction between inequality and growth. Since the work of Piketty et al. (2006), we know that wealth concentration increased sharply in Paris between the 1860 s and the 1900 s. It was also a period of economic crisis marked by the crisis of the nancial, industrial and real estate sectors. This large restructuring of the French economy a ected the wealth of a lot of individuals in France. In this context I wanted to understand if inheritors of very rich individuals were able to maintain the position of their parents and stay at the top of the distribution, or if they experienced massive losses in wealth and hence downward mobility. More generally, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the characteristics of the wealth of the parents a ected the accumulation pattern of the children. This question has at least two dimensions. First of all the value of the wealth a ects the endowments of the children and their accumulation pattern. Inheritors may behave di erently- all othe...|$|E
40|$|Serial killers {{are present}} in most Media today: TV-shows, books, magazines, news shows and music. Research about them {{has been made in}} many fields, such as criminology, {{psychology}} and psychiatry. There is also research about the serial killer as a cultural being. In my paper I have looked into the serial killer in fiction. I have chosen to compare two novels that deal with the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. The novels are Lotta Lotass’ Min röst skall nu komma från en annan plats i rummet and Joyce Carols Oates’ Zombie. By examining how the novels relate to the actual case and how they describe the violence and the person,I wanted to see if fiction can give a contrasting picture of how serial killers are usually described. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> itis possible for fiction to represent serial killers as persons rather thanas inhuman monsters. My paper shows that although the novels differ in a lot of aspects, they both manage to contrast the picture of Dahmer. Zombieis more loosely based on Dahmer than Min röst, but focuses more on the violence. The Dahmer character in Zombie is more psychologically complex than the one in Min röst, but they both manage to describe the characters as human and they both avoid the stereotypical representation of serial killers...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} I analyzed early modern adaptations of four myths {{present in the}} Metamorphoses written by Publius Ovidius Naso (34 BC – AD 17). In the myths I have selected - the myth of Tiresias, Hermaphroditus and Salmacis, Iphis and Caenis/Caeneus - curious gender transformations take place, in which the characters transform into the opposite sex or into a hermaphrodite. I {{was interested in the}} discrepancy between the fictional world of Ovid and the ‘real’ world of early modern Europe in regards to gender transgression and wanted to know how these four myths are used, manipulated, depicted and/or censured in early modern translations and commentaries. Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> interpretations of these myths change over time and if they differ per Northern European country (England, the Dutch Republic, France and Germany). The early modern adaptations show that gender transgression was viewed with the utmost suspicion and are described as abormalities. Gender transgression distorted the social and natural order. This narrative is enforced by the use of explicit early modern notions of gender, which are emphasized in these translations and added to the original text. The myths are used to define and reinforce these distinctions, considering any deviation of these norms as abnormal. Specifically the fear of becoming feminine is emphasized, which is presented as being an abominable fate. The distinctions between men and women were so strong {{that it was impossible to}} overcome them, even if they are described in a fictional world...|$|E

With this research I wanted to analyse teachers and teacher assistants view {{on the importance of}} games and modern toys in personality development of children, what they think about quality and materials of modern toys and which toys do children play with in today's kindergartens in Prlekija. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> they have any influence on parents when they are buying suitable toys for their children or do children in Prlekija spend to much time {{in front of the television}} and computer. I also wanted to know if spending time watching television and playing computer games has any impact on childs social development and behaviour. Results showed that modern toys are well made but have low quality. Teachers and teacher assistants in Prlekija think, that modern toys are didacticly well made and that colors are suitable too. They also think that in the area of personality development today's toys do not offer any additional options. Teachers and their assistants in kindergartens in Prlekija have positive opinion about organized and thoughtful choice of television shows and their positivie influence on childrens behaviour. Use of a computer limits childrens social development, but at the same time it accelerates other abilities. Research has shown that professional workers in kindergartens in Prlekija think that parents do not know how to choose the correct toy for their children. Most commonly used games in today's kindergartens in Prlekija are človek ne jezi se and lego. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} {{case study}} design was used for this inquiry. Photo elicitation was used with six participants, well older adults, to draw out their stories and experiences related to home safety. Each participant was engaged in three "rounds" of photography based on provided prompts and an interview followed each round. Interviews took place online through VSee, a HIPPA-approved web-based video conference program. These interviews were seen as a version of telehealth—with an educational focus. In {{the analysis of the}} interview transcripts and other data collected (e. g., home health safety instrument, SAFER-HOME, v. 3, used during initial and final in-person meetings with the participants, researcher journals), I endeavored to understand whether or not narrative learning, a form of adult learning, was facilitated. So, in essence, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the photo elicitation process—with participant-produced photos—was an antecedent to narrative learning. Additionally, I endeavored to understand if and how this process can be an effective tool for education-based telehealth services, which could benefit health care professionals such as occupational therapists and their clients. Findings include the value of photos to support narrative learning, the value of narrative learning related to home safety education, the use of friend narratives by women, collaborative cognition, and confidence. Procedural findings (i. e., findings related to the methods employed) include the abstract versus concrete nature of a photo assignment, challenges with older adults and technology, and the challenge of building rapport in a web-based format. Overall, participants showed small changes in their SAFER-HOME, v. 3 scores indicating they made a small number of environmental modifications. Findings were examined in light of the existing literature and indicate that within a wellness context, home safety education for older adults can be delivered effectively via telehealth when using photo elicitation as an antecedent to narrative learning.
