6000|$|... "Now then, Miss Tuppence," [...] said Sir James, [...] "you {{know this}} place better than I do. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{we should take}} up our quarters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{tells me}} so," [...] she answered, with a laugh. [...] "How uncourtier-like you are, Paul! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that any man {{could see me}} and not love me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{should tell}} <b>you</b> that I <b>did</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> to me. I asked Alec MacKenzie pointblank, and he {{confessed that he}} was guilty of George's death.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he protested, [...] "even if I <b>did</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> {{and went}} back into politics, it would be some time, if ever, before I should be any better off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, yes," [...] Hunterleys replied, {{frowning}} slightly. [...] "I am sorry, but I am not {{at liberty}} to <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> just at present. I wish you good fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> {{instead of}} them? Some {{of the kids}} are jolly keen and all that, but they wouldn't be much good against Baynes and Lorimer, for instance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are insolent!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You will be {{good enough}} to answer questions, not to ask them. Answer me, then. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that I have your necklace?" ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> Miss Fairfax, that I {{entrapped}} Ernest into an engagement? How dare you? This is no {{time for}} wearing the shallow mask of manners. When I see a spade I call it a spade.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try to {{understand}} how I'm situated. I may have my sympathies, but I can't be a partizan; my business is to see <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your work. Suppose I <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> will it make any trouble in the camp? I want a straight answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} cunning of the Coyote, my captain," [...] cried Pesita. [...] "It shall be <b>done</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> Go now, and I will send for Captain Byrne, {{and give him}} his orders for the morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, Messer Francisco," [...] {{the captain}} said obstinately. [...] "I had no part or hand in the business, beyond <b>doing</b> what <b>you</b> <b>suggested,</b> and <b>you</b> would have got the Lido off just as well if I hadn't been there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> then? Letting Milady's Boudoir join Civilisation in the melting-pot. Because {{that is what}} it will infallibly do unless I get a cheque by next week. The {{printers}} {{have been}} showing a nasty spirit for months." ...|$|E
60|$|The name of {{the other}} {{waitress}} was Tildy. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> Matilda? Please listen this time--Tildy--Tildy. Tildy was dumpy, plain-faced, and too anxious to please to please. Repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice, and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are, unfortunately," [...] Lord Cheisford remarked, [...] "not in a {{position}} to adopt such extreme measures. It would not even be wise for us to attempt to formulate a legal charge against him. The position is somewhat embarrassing. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> Duke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear--I do wish I knew {{whether you}} were {{a boy or a}} girl. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>suggest</b> that I should engage you as my housekeeper?" [...] asked Mr. Peter Hope, now upright {{with his back to the}} fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's <b>done</b> <b>you</b> good," [...] <b>suggested</b> the {{secretary}} with ironic seriousness. [...] "Takes your mind off that silly trouble. At your age too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Make {{the other}} person happy about <b>doing</b> what <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> People will most often respond well when they desire to do the {{behavior}} put forth.

6000|$|Her colour rose. [...] "Well, sir? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that I implied or {{seemed to}} imply?" [...] But as {{suddenly}} her manner changed. [...] "I {{think we are}} too concerned with trifles where the matter on which I have sought you is a serious one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] Strether replied--and {{he had it}} even {{to himself}} {{surprisingly}} ready--"my dear lady, his mother has paid HIM a visit. Mrs. Newsome has been with him, this month, with an intensity that I'm sure he has thoroughly felt; he has lavishly entertained her, and she has let him have her thanks. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> he shall go back for more of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} hasn't. For what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that I suppose {{her to take}} you? But you've been with her every day, you've seen her freely, you've liked her greatly--I stick to that--and you've made your profit of it. You know what she has been through {{as well as you}} know that she has dined here to-night--which must have put her, by the way, through a good deal more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, little one," [...] I answered, {{as we went}} indoors. [...] "You {{have been}} over-excited by all these wild doings, and you need a sound night's rest to compose <b>you.</b> I'll <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> however, and our friends shall judge for {{themselves}} whether these poor fellows should be sent about their business or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Grizel {{seemed to}} reply gently, {{but with the}} {{firmness}} he adored: [...] "I know I cannot change, {{and it would be}} mistaken kindness to <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> No, I can give you no hope; but though I can never marry you, I will watch your future with warm regard, for you have to-day paid me the highest compliment a man can pay a woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It cannot be, my friend," [...] he said. [...] "There is {{more than}} a throne at stake for me, but to win them both I could not <b>do</b> the thing <b>you</b> <b>suggest.</b> If Leopold of Lutha lives he must be crowned tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You speak roughly, Leo," [...] I said. [...] "You {{forget that}} I {{have had no}} sign, and that the {{nightmare}} of a man so near to insanity that but {{a few hours ago}} he was determined upon suicide, will be a poor staff to lean on when we are perishing in the snows of Central Asia. A mixed vision, this of yours, Leo, with its mountain peak shaped like a crux-ansata and the rest. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> that Ayesha is re-incarnated in Central Asia--as a female Grand Lama or something of that sort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{figures out}} that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out {{messages}} to an accomplice--there are {{several of his}} gang in London. Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight {{of us in the}} street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In a July 29, 2010 email to supporters, Coe {{questioned}} whether Muslim Americans could become assimilated into U.S. society, writing, [...] "However, since muslims {{subscribe to the}} teachings of the Koran - which is to torture/kill all non-believers - how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> we ‘Americanize’ those who want us beheaded?” Coe wrote, [...] "My efforts will be to share the TRUTH about these cold-blooded terrorists, urge others to strongly OPPOSE the building of mosques training camps, and urge SUPPORT of all efforts to get them DEPORTED to their country of origin where they can commit their barbaric Satanic acts at will.” ...|$|E
40|$|A {{book review}} of 'Evaluating e-learning', Philips, Rob et al, Routledge (New York & London), ISBN: 978 - 0 - 415 - 88194 - 4. This book seeks to formalise {{approaches}} to e-learning {{by ensuring that}} e-resource design is evaluated and appropriately supported by evidence. The book is aimed at academics who design e-learning systems and need to devise scholarly evaluation research to assess their success. If this book's likely to relate closely to what <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I <b>suggest</b> <b>you</b> borrow a copy so you can assess it for yourself. 1 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|Art critic Amy Karlinsky, {{writing in}} BorderCrossings, opined that Richardson's [...] "minimal and collapsible" [...] Red State [...] "hinted at her {{capacity}} to generate metaphor": its [...] "monumentality" [...] was [...] "all sham and seductive illusion [...] - [...] a tidy reference to both art and politics". And Karlinsky had earlier enjoyed [...] "Richardson's fabulous and funny kinetic sculptures of 2002", which {{in her view}} [...] "invited viewer participation and provided wry commentary on Canadian icons and symbolism". But Karlinsky found Inter-Glacial Free Trade Agency.ca [...] "more fraught" [...] by contrast, and agreed with the exhibition curator that Richardson's environmental concerns were integral to her works and had [...] "catalyzed" [...] her into production. How, she wondered, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> something as vast as the Arctic? [...] "A simulated and disjointed landscape confronts the viewer. It is a depopulated, dystopic scenario" [...] with strange artistic details. [...] "Much is eerie, evocative and otherworldly." ...|$|R

"The mails between Pasadena and Los Angeles {{are always}} exasperatingly slow and Mr. Sherman and I are {{especially}} disappointed that your most kind note {{asking us to}} call on you on last Sunday afternoon did not reach us until Monday morning {{and so we were}} naturally unable to <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggested.</b> " [...] first line...|$|R
5000|$|Saul's {{birthmark}} {{is more of}} a symbol, but {{it still}} touches upon the theme of cultural hybridism. While Saul finds himself to be infatuated with the Machiguenga culture, his birthmark is essentially a constant reminder of the society from which he truly came. When interacting with Westerners, Saul gladly accepts any insults he is given that relate to the birthmark and even goes as far as to don the nickname [...] "Mascarita," [...] translating to [...] "mask-face." [...] When a drunk man calls him a monster and tells him to keep his face off the streets, Saul simply smiles and replies, [...] "but if this is the only one I've got, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> I do?" [...] (14). Despite this appearance of incivility, Saul finally gets relatively flustered when discussing the fact that the Machiguengas kill any newborns who are imperfect. Since Saul's face is scarred, he would not have made it into the Machiguenga society. The narrator notes that this was [...] "the only time he ever alluded, not jokingly but seriously, even dramatically, to what was undoubtedly a tragedy in his life" [...] (26). Since so many of his relationships in the past have been killed off by his imperfection, Saul seems most feared that his relationship with the Machiguengas will be marred by this permanent reminder of Western culture. That aside, the mark also helps accentuate the Machiguenga's practice of unity and collectivism, for in the end, they accept him as a person more than any Western culture did.|$|E
40|$|A 2 -year-old male {{presented}} with a congenital polypoid mass on the nasal skin; no recent growth. The infant was born at term without other congenital anomalies. There was no family history of similar skin lesions. The polypoid lesion was surgically removed. At macroscopy, the polyp sample measured 6 x 3 x 3 mm, it was elastic and skin covered. At the microscopic examination, the sections showed a lesion covered by a normal epidermis; dermis was composed of skeletal muscle fibers, mature adipose tissue and fibrous connettive fibres; the skeletal muscle fibers were aligned perpendicular to the surface epithelium. 1.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 490 - 552. Two {{fundamental}} questions which frequently confront a children's librarian are 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suggest</b> my child should read?' and 'Why does my child not read, {{and what can}} be done to rectify the situation?' It is fairly easy to deal with the first question by referring either to one's own knowledge of children's literature or to the many authoritative books on the subject. The second question poses a problem, because, although much concern has been expressed regarding reading reluctance, current perceptions generally relate to limited aspects only. Such perceptions tend to be based on incidental observations and untested premises rather than on rigorously executed research. Hence it was decided to undertake this research project in an attempt to fill a gap in a sound understanding of reading reluctance among children in a given library environment...|$|E
60|$|You state, in your {{issue of}} today, that I {{misrepresented}} you when I said that <b>you</b> <b>suggested</b> that a book so wicked as mine should be 'suppressed and coerced by a Tory Government.' Now, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not propose this, but <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>suggest</b> it. When <b>you</b> declare that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not know whether}} or not the Government will take action about my book, and remark that the authors of books much less wicked have been proceeded against in law, the suggestion is quite obvious.|$|R

I have twice tried to get away from her and have failed. Perhaps it may be right now to <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suggest,</b> though after all the time seems not very suitable; but, as you truly observe, she has lost her natural protector, for of course you cannot be a father to her any longer. Yes, I'll go and see Fred about it." ...|$|R
