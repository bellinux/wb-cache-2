Sodium metasomatism {{was accompanied by}} hydrothermal leaching of granite quartz to form vuggy albite rocks (episyenites). Vugs created by quartz dissolution were filled in by hydrothermal minerals, including albite, K feldspar, and/or muscovite and cassiterite; late phases are dominated by quartz and fluorite. Swarms of parallel veinlets crosscut the albitized zones. These veinlets were formed by repeated fracturing in response to local fluid over-pressures. They contain infill mineralogy similar to the vugs and probably formed at least partly contemporaneously with vug infill. Due to the overprinting at various scales of alteration, vug infill, and vein formation stages, chemical changes associated with <b>episyenite</b> formation are only qualitatively constrained. However, the mineralogical and textural features of the alteration zones suggest that most major and trace elements had substantial mobility during their formation.

40|$|The {{core of the}} Tauern {{tectonic window}} (Eastern Alps) {{consists}} of dominant pre-Alpine granitoids (∼ 295 Ma) that were metamorphosed and deformed during the Alpine orogenesis (at ∼ 30 Ma). Ductile deformation at peak conditions (550 - 600 ̊C and 0. 5 - 0. 7 GPa) was followed by cataclastic faulting (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2007). Both deformation phases occurred in a fluid-rich environment with formation of veins filled with quartz- calcite-biotite-feldspar and quartz-chlorite-epidote-adularia-calcite, respectively. Faults are typically low displace- ment strike-slip structures (offset < 1 m) organized in en-echelon arrays at different scales with a stepping geometry consistent {{with the sense of}} fault slip (e. g. left-stepping for dextral slip). Fault stepovers include pervasive frac- turing dominated by a set of antithetic faults (Pennacchioni and Mancktelow, 2013). These faults were locally exploited by episyenitic alteration which represented the "last" event of fluid-rock interaction in the Tauern meta- granitoids. <b>Episyenites</b> within metagranodiorites have a macroscopic porosity in the range between 25 and 35...|$|R

40|$|Basic to {{intermediate}} high-K, high-Mg mantle-derived rocks occur throughout the Iberian Massif and {{are particularly important}} in the Tormes Dome, where vaugnerites form several stocks and small plutons. One {{of the largest and}} geochemically most variable among these plutons is the Calzadilla pluton in the Tormes Dome that crystallized at 318 ± 1. 4 Ma (Bashkirian; U-Pb TIMS zircon). This age reveals that the vaugnerite pluton was emplaced during the transition from late D 2 extensional deformation to early D 3 contractional deformation (319 to 317 Ma). Large-scale extension in the area resulted, on one hand, in extensive anatexis in the crust due to quasiisothermal decompression and mica-dehydration melting and, on the other hand, in the upwelling of the mantle, which induced partial melting of the enriched domains in the lithospheric mantle. The driving reason why crustal and mantle melts were coeval is extension. The U-Pb ID-TIMS age of allanite is not related to the emplacement nor cooling of the Calzadilla vaugnerite, but it seems to be related to a younger subsolidus overprint ca. 275 Ma that, in the scale of the Central Iberian Zone, corresponds to a period of hydrothermal alteration, including <b>episyenite</b> formation and tungsten mineralization...|$|E

40|$|Several {{episodes of}} {{hydrothermal}} activity related to periods of fracturing and/or reactivation of previous structures took place from 300 to - at least - 100 Ma, in the Sierra del Guadarrama, {{which is part}} of the crystalline axis of the Iberian Hercynian Fold Belt (Central-Iberian Zone). One of these episodes led to the formation of episyenites, which are de-quartzified and alkalinized granites. <b>Episyenite</b> formation took place on a regional scale and in a short period (approx. at 277 Ma). The episyenites were formed by the action of fluids at temperatures between 350 °C and 650 °C, at depths of about 6. 5 km, and in microfractured dilatancy zones developed under a regional extensional regime. These zones are crosscut by normal faults, developed during the progressive deformation process accompanying the formation of the episyenites. The calculated regional palaeostress tensor has r I close to vertical and σ 3 between NI 0 - 20 E and an average value of the stress ratio (Ф) of 0. 19 [Ф = (σ 2 - σ 3) /(σ 1 - σ 3) ]. Because σ 1 is close to vertical the stress tensor is compatible with an extensional deformation field. The analysis also shows that most of the faults that slip under this stress field have an average coefficient of friction of 0. 8. This extensional regime was probably accompanied by a regional thermal anomaly, as suggested by the high temperature of the fluids involved, which are amagmatic. This thermo-tectonic episode is interpreted as representative of the generalized extensional regime corresponding to the onset of the Alpine Cycle. The episode was preceded by a wrench-faulting event, equivalent to the Late Variscan event of Arthaud and Matte (1977), for which an age of - at least - 300 - 290 Ma is indicated by recent radiometric data. In its turn, this event was preceded by the regional extensional gravitative collapse of the Hercynian orogen. A correlation between evidence from the cover (stratigraphy and volcanism) and evidence from the basement (hydrothermal alterations, dyke injection episodes and granitic magmatism) is attempted on the basis of new available radiometric data...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} my master thesis had {{manifold}} goals {{with the aim}} of learning different research approaches, techniques and expertises at this stage of my career. The studied area is the southwestern portion of the Tauern Window of the Eastern Alps exposing the metagranitoids and the derived mylonites forming the core of the Penninic basement nappe exposed beneath the Austroalpine unit. The study of the area has addressed different topics ranging from the regional tectonics of this part of the Eastern Alps to more process-oriented issues such as the nucleation of ductile shear zones and the processes of fluid-rock interaction during deformation. The thesis has involved 2 campaigns of field work addressed to the structural analysis in several selected areas and the characterization of samples in the lab by different methods. The Tauern Window is a major tectonic feature of Eastern Alps where the Alpine Pennidic tectonic unit (nappe) is exposed beneath the Austroalpine nappe. The sequence of Alpine deformation events should be recorded in the field by a series of overprinting fabrics including mylonites and faults with a different kinematics: (i) thrusting associated with the stage of nappe stacking; (ii) strike-slip associated with the component of lateral escape, and (iii) normal “faulting” associated with the unroofing of the exhuming nappe pile and with the activity of the Brenner Fault system (Goldny et al., 2008). The structural field work was mainly addressed to identify and map the structures associated with the different tectonic components described above in the southwestern border of the Tauern Window. The structural study followed the reference scheme given by previous works of Mancktelow and Pennacchioni (2005) and Pennacchioni and Mancktelow (2007) for the Neves area was extended during my master thesis (i) N-S to cover a complete traverse across the tectonic unit (from the Neves area to the Zillertal Valley) and (ii) E-W over a distance of ca. 8 km (from the Moosboden glacial cirque to the Hochfeiler area). The structural sequence includes a phase of ductile deformation, syn-kinematic to amphibolite facies conditions, and a later overprint by cataclastic faults. The ductile deformation is heterogeneously distributed and this partitioning is scale-independent. Within the low strain domain the ductile deformation is localized at the outcrop scale to a network of discrete (of as much as a few meters thick) shear zones. This structural evolution indicates a NNWSSE to almost N-S shortening during the Alpine deformation from the synmetamorphic (amphibolite facies: 550 – 600 °C, 0. 4 - 0. 7 GPa) mylonites to the brittle faulting during exhumation, respectively. Both the mylonites and the faults of the Neves area have a strike-slip kinematics. Both the ductile and the brittle deformation occurred under hydrous conditions as witnessed by the common occurrence of veins associated with deformation structures. An episode of fluidrock interaction postdated the main phase of faulting and is associated with the local development of episyenites. Structures linked to thrust and exhumation tectonics are missing from our are. Thrust structures are likely to have been overprinted by the following strike-slip lateral escape tectonics. Exhumation structures instead seems to be confined to a narrow deformation zone along the Brenner Line. The western zone have a homogeneous distribution of the strain, and the comparison between homogeneous deformation structures and partitioned structures has allowed us to define the zone as a purely constrictional transpression zone (Fossen & Tikoff, 1998). However, the partitioning in strain intensity over the region is not associated with a partitioning of components of thrusting, lateral escape and detachment in no stage of deformation, as is instead observed in other geological contexts (Fossen et al., 1994). The study area provides an ideal natural laboratory {{for the study of the}} process of ductile shear zone nucleation. It provides spectacular glacier-polished outcrops within metagranitoids that preserve all stages of incremental development of structures in a relatively simple and “isotropic” material. The field observations indicates: In contrast with numerical and rock-analogue models (e. g. Mancktelow, 2002; Mancktelow and Pennacchioni, 2014) shear zone nucleation never occurred within homogeneous metagranodiorites Almost any structural or compositional (rheological) surface heterogeneity (e. g. fractures, dykes, veins and lithological contacts) was capable of been exploited by localized shear deformation. The type of exploited precursor determined the type of shear zone and geometrical characters: (i) weak precursors compared to the host metagranodiorites (“unfilled” fractures; quartz veins; biotite-rich basic dykes) localized strain: shear zones have commonly a rather homogeneous strain distribution and a sharp boundary to almost undeformed host rock; (ii) strong layers (aplite dykes; alteration haloes surrounding veins) localized the deformation at their boundaries forming paired shear zoned at their selvages mainly developed within the metagranodiorite. Reactivation of original ductile shear zones can explain the controversial sense of shear of some paired shear zones exploiting the alteration halos surrounding epidote-filled veins. This contrasting sense of shears is interpreted as due to Alpine reactivation of original ductile shear zones developed in the pre-Alpine granitoid protolith as result of the original evolution during pluton cooling similar to what is described for some intrusions elsewhere (e. g. Pennacchioni, 2005; Pennacchioni and Zucchi, 2013). The latest episode of fluid-rock interaction, which has not been previously described, is responsible for the formation of local episyenites which postdated the main episode of brittle faulting. Episyenites are quartz-depleted, alkalimetasomatized granitoids (Cathelineau, 1986), strictly connected to either brittle or ductile shear zones (Rossi et al. 2005), and characterized by a conspiquous porosity. The field study has indicated that episyenites are associated to cataclastic faults but do not pervasively exploited the fault structure; fluid flow and alteration were not influenced by compositional and/or textural anisotropies of the host rock; no clear relation between fault slip and <b>episyenite</b> volume was observed. The composition of the host rock influence the spatial development, indeed quartz-poor lithologies commonly limit the diffusion of the fluid and of the alteration; in a similar way ductile textures of the host rock may limit or restrain the fluid diffusion. Mass-balance calculation from XRF bulk chemistry, aided with μ-CT volume evaluation, suggest that episyenites are due to a Na-metasomatism of parent rock and that have a particular paragnesis including: Plagioclase (Plg 2 :Ab 99 that overgrows Plg 1 :Ab 85) + Vermicular Chlorite + Adularia + Calcite ± Anatase ± Hematite ± Apatite.
