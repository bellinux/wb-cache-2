40|$|Abstract. We {{set up a}} {{two-stage}} {{game with}} sequential moves by one altruistic agent and n selfish agents. The rotten kid theorem states that the altruist can only reach her <b>first</b> best <b>when</b> the selfish agents move before the altruist. The Samaritan’s dilemma, on the other hand, states that the altruist can only reach her <b>first</b> best <b>when</b> she moves before the selfish agents. We find that in general, the altruist can reach her <b>first</b> best <b>when</b> she moves <b>first,</b> {{if and only if}} a selfish agent’s action marginally only affects his own payoff. The altruist can reach her <b>first</b> best <b>when</b> she moves last if and only if a selfish agent cannot manipulate the price of his payoff. When the altruist cannot reach her <b>first</b> best <b>when</b> she moves last, the outcome is not Pareto efficient either. JEL Classification: D 6...|$|R

5|$|Air Vice Marshal William Lloyd (Bill) Hely, CB, CBE, AFC (24 August 1909– 20May 1970) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

His rescue efforts earned him the Air Force Cross. After occupying staff positions {{during the early years}} of World WarII, Hely was appointed Officer Commanding No.72 Wing in Dutch New Guinea in May 1944. Later that year he formed No.84 (Army Cooperation) Wing, commanding it during the Bougainville Campaign until the end of the Pacific War.|$|E

5|$|Another {{crucial role}} in the Clan is that of the deputy. When a new Clan leader is appointed, or the old deputy dies or retires, a new cat will be chosen to fulfill this role.

Although the Clan deputy still sleeps in the warriors den, they are respected by other members of the Clan. Often, a cat will come to the deputy <b>first</b> <b>when</b> asking for advice. When a Clan leader dies, the current deputy will take on the new role of leader, and receive their nine lives from StarClan.|$|E

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the <b>first.</b> <b>When</b> the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
