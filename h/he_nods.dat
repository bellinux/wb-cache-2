25|$|Bachelor Sanson Carrasco is seen {{covering}} a bookcase with wallpaper, while Antonina is putting some rusty old armour and a helmet made of pasteboard into a cupboard. Don Quixote de la Mancha enters, reading a book. He {{goes to the}} bookcase and, not finding it, believes it has been stolen by evil magicians. Then he settles into an armchair and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, {{but most of all}} Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be so lovely and noble that she must be divinity. Gradually <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.|$|E
500|$|When Laszlo makes inquiries, Ferrari, a major underworld {{figure and}} Rick's {{friendly}} business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Privately, Rick refuses {{to sell at}} any price, telling Laszlo to ask his wife the reason. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of officers in singing [...] "Die Wacht am Rhein" [...] ("The Watch on the Rhine"). Laszlo orders the house band to play [...] "La Marseillaise". When the band looks to Rick, <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> his head. Laszlo starts singing, alone at first, then patriotic fervor grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Strasser has Renault close the club.|$|E
60|$|SYLVIA (leaning {{back across}} the couch, aside to Charteris). Has she really chucked you? (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> assent. She looks at him dubiously, and adds) I expect you chucked her.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded.</b> <b>He</b> {{felt that}} it was useless to combat her resolution.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded.</b> [...] "To the wrong." [...] <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> again, almost cheerfully--as if he {{had been}} keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic. [...] "To the very, very wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|It is an unaccountable {{circumstance}} {{that he should}} have felt drowsy there, where the force of association might surely have been enough to keep him wide awake; but he did. He had not been in the snug little corner five minutes before <b>he</b> began to <b>nod.</b> <b>He</b> had not recovered himself one minute before <b>he</b> began to <b>nod</b> again. In the very act of opening his eyes indolently, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> again. In the very act of shutting them, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> again. So <b>he</b> fell out of one nod into another until at last <b>he</b> ceased to <b>nod</b> at all, and was as fast as the church itself.|$|R
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> {{his head}} toward the frosty panes, and wraps a sheet of {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And blessedness goes {{where the}} wind goes, [...] 'And when it is gone we are dead; [...] 'I see the blessedest soul in the world [...] 'And <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> a drunken head.|$|E
6000|$|RUFIO (looking grimly at her). I {{will look}} to it, Cleopatra. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> in {{confirmation}} of the promise, and slips out through the curtains, loosening his sword in its sheath as he goes.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> perfunctorily to the court, {{his face}} entirely calm.|$|R
60|$|I {{expressed}} my admiration to Poirot, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|The {{young woman}} looked towards him appealingly. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> reassuringly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whew!" [...] says Mr. George. [...] "You are hot here. Always a fire, eh? Well! Perhaps you {{do right}} {{to get used to}} one." [...] Mr. George makes the latter remark to himself as <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> to Grandfather Smallweed.|$|E
6000|$|That's only {{at church}} time; other days there's no crowd. [...] Don't laugh! See that big {{man who looked}} up and bowed? [...] That's our butcher--I call him the Sultan Mahoud [...] When <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> to me here at the window! ...|$|E
60|$|RAINA. I forgot. It {{might make}} you cry. (<b>He</b> <b>nods,</b> quite seriously. She pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) I {{must tell you that}} my father holds the highest command of any Bulgarian in our army. He is (proudly) a Major.|$|E
60|$|They {{looked at}} the little man, stupefied. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> cheerfully.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and walked}} away before Bateman could say another word.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} again, evincing even greater {{satisfaction}} than before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] {{says the}} Policeman {{tramping}} the pavement {{in front of}} the Great Eastern, and <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> his head pleasantly to show that he is the representative of Law and Peace and that the city of Calcutta is safe from itself for the present.|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Yes: aren't {{you glad}} it's been {{defeated}} for once? (She takes {{his arm to}} go out with him.) Captain Brassbound: I will come back to say goodbye before I go. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> gloomily. She goes out with Sir Howard, following the Captain and his staff.) ...|$|E
6000|$|EMILY--[In her lisp {{of hidden}} meanings.] Yes, the family mustn't forget--her condition. [The {{door from the}} study is opened and CURT appears. His face shows his {{annoyance}} at being interrupted, his eyes are preoccupied. They all turn and greet him embarrassedly. <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> silently and comes slowly down front.] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} gloomily, and seemed pondering a serious question.|$|R
60|$|Poirot {{seemed to}} follow my thoughts. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> his head gravely.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and resumed}} his chair. His {{unexpected}} politeness gave her courage.|$|R
6000|$|BOHUN (again {{interrupting}} him). My {{specialty is}} being right when {{other people are}} wrong. If you agreed with me I should be of no use here. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> at him to drive the point home; then turns suddenly and forcibly on Crampton.) Now you, Mr. Crampton: what point in this business have you most at heart? ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> {{towards a}} point of {{darkness}} behind Mr Wegg, the latter, with a slight start, looks round for 'that French gentleman,' whom he at length descries to be represented (in a very workmanlike manner) by his ribs only, standing on a shelf in another corner, {{like a piece of}} armour or a pair of stays.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and arrant {{babblers}} at home. In few words, Babbalanja, you espouse a bad cause. Most of you mortals are peacocks; some having tails, {{and some}} not; {{those who have}} them will be sure to thrust their plumes in your face; for the rest, they will display their bald cruppers, and still screech for admiration. But when a great genius is born into Mardi, <b>he</b> <b>nods,</b> and is known." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> genially, not {{noticing the}} {{suppressed}} excitement in de Cartienne's manner.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> gratefully, still moaning, and {{she hurried}} to rejoin Mr. Merrick.|$|R
60|$|Someone {{whispered into}} the captain's ear, whereon <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> and laughed savagely.|$|R
6000|$|ZOE: (Tears {{open the}} silverfoil) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts {{and then turns}} kittenishly to Lynch) No {{objection}} to French lozenges? (<b>He</b> <b>nods.</b> She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch! ...|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (suddenly {{gripping}} {{him by the}} arm as {{he turns}} away again to the cabinet). So much the worse for them. I tell you you don't understand my character. If I could spare all my teeth, I'd make you pull them all out one after another to shew you what a properly hardened man can go through with when he's made up his mind to do it. (<b>He</b> <b>nods</b> at him to enforce the effect of this declaration, and releases him.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... [p.73]But {{sometimes}} <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> over {{a difficult}} passage under my very eyes, or he reads {{it over a}} dozen times in the wantonness of idleness, or he takes what school-boys call a long [...] "shot" [...] most shamelessly at the signification. When this happens I lose my temper, and raise my voice, and shout, [...] "Verily there is no power nor might save in Allah, the High, the Great!" [...] Then he looks at me, and with passing meekness whispers- ...|$|E
60|$|Saying this, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> {{farewell}} to Tollydiggle and Ojo and went away.|$|R
60|$|She saw {{the light}} in his eyes fix determinedly, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> and untucked {{the napkin}} {{he had already}} {{arranged}} over his waistcoat.|$|R
