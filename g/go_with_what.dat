I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E

[...] However, after being prodded by the hosts {{to take the money}} instead, Weng decided to forgo the {{possible}} jackpot prize revealed in the white wheel and instead take home the ₱100,000 for this round, plus the ₱37,000 from the earlier round. After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. [...] This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.|$|E
500|$|The band {{spoke on}} their Facebook page {{and said they}} started {{recording}} new material on October 20. On January 16, 2012, they revealed track names for the new EP on Facebook. Initially, rumors spread {{about the possibility of}} Down releasing four EPs, instead of an album. However, when asked about it in an interview with Scuzz TV, Anselmo said that [...] "It would be too pretentious, we try not to think as far ahead as that, and just <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> we feel at the time." [...] In the summer of 2013, Kirk Windstein quit the band and was replaced by Bobby Landgraf. Down IV– Part II was released on May 13, 2014.|$|E

500|$|The Cookbook {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 28 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Rich Juzwiak of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A rating, stating [...] "Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona {{is allowed to}} wander wherever it wants on The Cookbook, be it avant or common." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote, [...] "The Cookbook is a convincing return to form.... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly not a woman to be messed with." [...] John Bush of AllMusic noted that [...] "Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop.... What's different here is how relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to simply <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> comes naturally and sounds best." [...] Q stated [...] "If not Elliott's most inventive album, The Cookbook is certainly her most colourful and entertaining".|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do things differently on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself [...] "I gotta <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

2500|$|In this position, Magliocco was in {{agreement}} with Jone Salomonsen, the feminist theologian and ethnographer who had performed fieldwork among the Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco {{in order to gain}} research for her book Enchanted Feminism (2002). Salomonsen had called this mixed insider/outsider approach the [...] "method of compassion" [...] and wrote that it [...] "does not refer to a wholesale positive embracement, nor to passionate criticisms and arguing, but to something in between... Engagement is more than participation, and something other than pretending. To allow oneself to become engaged is to take the ritual seriously. It is [...] willing to let the trance induction take you into trance, to be willing to be emotionally moved as is intended by certain ritual elements, and [...] <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Labour: At the 1985 Labour Party {{conference in}} Bournemouth, a {{resolution}} committing {{the party to}} support LGBT rights passed {{for the first time}} due to block voting support from the National Union of Mineworkers. In April 2010, Labour Minister for Equality Harriet Harman when asked about same-sex marriage said the issue was a [...] "developing area" [...] and that the Government still had a long way to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> it had done with gay rights. Then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the Government did not allow same-sex marriage because it was [...] "intimately bound up with questions of religious freedom". During the 2010 Labour leadership election campaign, each of the Labour candidates expressed their support for reform to lead to the recognition of same-sex marriage. Following Ed Miliband's victory it became Labour party policy, with the party welcoming HM Government's consultation and calling for legislation to be brought forth as soon as possible.|$|E
2500|$|After {{promoting}} Watermark, Enya purchased new {{recording equipment}} and started {{work on her}} next album, Shepherd Moons. She found the success of Watermark caused {{a considerable amount of}} pressure when it came to writing new songs, adding: [...] "I kept thinking [...] "Would this have gone on Watermark? Is it as good?" [...] Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> felt right." [...] Enya wrote songs based on several ideas, including entries from her diary, The Blitz in London, and her grandparents. Shepherd Moons was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than Watermark, reaching number one at home for one week and number 17 in the United States. [...] "Caribbean Blue", its lead single, charted at number thirteen in the United Kingdom. By 1997, the album had reached multi-platinum certification for selling in excess of 1.2million copies in the United Kingdom and 5 million in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Starting {{in spring}} 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a {{playback}} {{of the dialogue}} soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, {{but as part of}} an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it. The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photoshat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, [...] "Anytime you'd think of another way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'! Well, you could get the animation camera up there! So you had to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> worked well in live action." ...|$|E

Disdainful and imperious as she was at times, he knew there was a wealth of softer qualities in his companion now.

The Armity usually brackets three Line regiments together, and calls for men for six months or a year for Malta, Gib, or elsewhere, at a bob a day. Three battalions will give you nearly a whole battalion of bachelors between 'em. You fill up deficiencies with a call on the territorial Volunteer battalion, and away you <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> we call a Ports battalion. What's astonishing in that?
