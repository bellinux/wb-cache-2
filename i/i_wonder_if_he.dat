500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the April 22, 2007 episode of The Sopranos titled [...] "Remember When" [...] aired, Losts co-creator Damon Lindelof met with fellow {{executive}} producer/writer/show runner Carlton Cuse and said that [...] "there's an actor on th show —I'm {{not going to tell}} you who he is—and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has the same impression on you that he had on me". [...] Cuse correctly guessed Ken Leung, who had guest starred as one-time character Carter Chong, a young and angry mental patient. [...] In mid-May, they contacted Leung's agent and were informed in July that he was available and interested in working on Lost. [...] To limit the leak of spoilers, Lindelof and Cuse auditioned Leung with a character and scene created specifically for the audition that would not be used in the show but was [...] "analogous to the role [...] really want." [...] Leung believed that he was auditioning for the role of Russell, a [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] in his late thirties with immense knowledge across various scientific fields, limited social skills and broken personal relationships. [...] Leung was the only actor who tried out for this part, as writers had written the role of Miles for him; had he not accepted the job, the character would have been completely rewritten. [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom' [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{dedicate}} {{this book}} to my son, Hart Merriam Schultz, or Ni-tah'-mah-kwi-i (Lone Wolf), as his mother's people name him. Born near {{the close of}} the buffalo days he was, and ever since with his baby hands he began to model statuettes of horses and buffalo and deer with clay from the river-banks, his one object in life has been {{to make a name for}} himself in the world of art. And now, at last, he has furnished the drawings for one of my books, this book. His own grandfather, Black Eagle, was a mighty warrior against the Snakes. What would the old man say, <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were alive and could see his grandson so sympathetically picturing incidents in the life of Bird Woman, a daughter of the Snakes." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} murdered somewhere down a back street, and if I should miss him very much.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> the same. Surely it is impossible! Only a {{schoolmaster}} still! Do {{you know}} his Christian name--is it Richard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had fancied she {{experienced}} any difficulty in standing up before that innocently good-humored face, but I {{could not resist}} saying:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Mike Kenny, the postman, I think. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{has brought}} a letter from sister May. Mother expects one, I know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{did it for}} a joke, {{a double}} joke on Reddy and myself," [...] Jimmy went on, {{scratching}} his head thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I suppose so," [...] said Sidney absently. I {{could see}} he wasn't {{thinking}} of me at all. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were thinking of Mrs. Rennie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's reasonable,' I answered: for I am a {{political}} economist. 'The benefit should be mutual.' But <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to}} propose at sight to me.|$|R
6000|$|Brown makes {{at such an}} hour of night! [...] He's celebrating {{something}} strange. [...] <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> {{sold his}} farm, [...] Or been made Master of the Grange." ...|$|R

60|$|Will Clerk {{says he has}} {{a theory}} on the {{vitrified}} forts. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> and I agree. I think accidental conflagration is the cause.|$|E

60|$|It {{struck me}} {{forcibly}} that Wright {{did all the}} calling. He hurried, too, tried to keep in the lead. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew his voice would be recognized by the hiding man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Saunders is a jolly good chap. He bowled me a half-volley on the off {{the first}} ball I had in a school match. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> out at the net now. Let's go and see." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{told that}} Commodore Barney keeps his men jumpin' so lively at fightin' that they don't {{have time for}} anythin' else," [...] the lad said slowly, as if {{speaking}} to himself, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> counted that the commodore could raise the price of oysters.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{caught up}} with me on the road home, and grinned as cheerfully as usual. But his grin could never deceive me again. I had seen the REAL Jonas. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could ever see the REAL PHIL--whom NOBODY, not even you, Anne, has ever seen yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you notice," [...] he whispered, [...] "that we {{can hear}} the wind much plainer here than in the passage?

60|$|Hearing a soft footfall, I {{glanced over}} my shoulder, {{to see the}} Mexican that I had noticed at the station. He was coming from across the street. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{watching}} me. He might be. My heart began to beat violently. Turning once again, I discovered that the fellow could not {{be seen in the}} pitchy blackness. Then I broke into a run.|$|R
6000|$|Two things {{particularly}} {{pressed into}} their minds. One was {{the thought of}} their children, and I do not care to tell how often in the day now they calculated the time in England, and tried to guess to a half mile or so where those young people might be and what they might be doing. [...] "The shops are bright for Christmas now," [...] said Marjorie. [...] "This year Dick was to have had his first fireworks. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> burnt his dear little funny stumps of fingers.

6000|$|I went {{on through}} the {{plantations}} and out upon the downs, and thence I saw Cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring down wind to my old familiar [...] "grounding" [...] place.

[...] "Like Cothope's cheek," [...] thought I, [...] "to go on with the research. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> keeping notes.... But all this will have to stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They seem to be," [...] replied Thorne. [...] "One of them {{looks like}} the corporal, and <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted a word with me." ...|$|R
