50|$|Functioning in {{a similar}} manner as a {{conventional}} <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> systems provide heat by recirculating conditioned building air through solar collectors. Through the use of an energy collecting surface to absorb the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air to come in contact with it, a simple and effective collector can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|E
50|$|A heating {{ventilation}} and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) home inspection reviews the heating and cooling system of a home from a performance perspective. The inspection usually does not inspect or compare to codes or manufacturer requirements. Heating is provided typically by a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> distributed by duct work or a water/steam boiler using radiators or convectors, but space heaters, heat pumps and other methods are also in use. The energy source is usually natural gas, fuel oil, or electric, but other sources include butane, wood and Geo-thermal. Cooling {{can be described as}} a split system, packaged unit, fan coil, heat pump, an evaporative cooler, or window/through-the-wall a/c unit.|$|E
50|$|A simple solar air {{collector}} {{consists of an}} absorber material, sometimes having a selective surface, to capture radiation {{from the sun and}} transfers this thermal energy to air via conduction heat transfer. This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs. Functioning in a similar manner as a conventional <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface, absorbing the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air coming in contact with it. Simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|E
50|$|Liquid-to-air {{heat pumps}} (also called water-to-air) output <b>forced</b> <b>air,</b> and are most {{commonly}} used to replace legacy <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> and central <b>air</b> conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems. Heat pumps cannot achieve as high a fluid temperature as a conventional furnace, so they require a higher volume flow rate of air to compensate. When retrofitting a residence, the existing duct work {{may have to be}} enlarged to reduce the noise from the higher air flow.|$|R
5000|$|Gas fired <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> have {{a burner}} in the furnace fuelled by natural gas. A blower <b>forces</b> cold <b>air</b> through a heat {{exchanger}} {{and then through}} duct-work that distributes the hot air through the building. [...] Each room will have an outlet from the duct system, often mounted in the floor or low on the wall - some rooms will also have an opening into the cold air return duct. Depending on {{the age of the}} system, <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> gas <b>furnaces</b> use either a pilot light or a solid state ignition system (spark or hot surface ignition) to light the natural gas burner. The natural gas is fed to buildings from a main gas line. The duct work supplying the hot air (and sometimes cool air if an AC unit is tied into the system) may be insulated. A thermostat starts and stops the furnace to regulate temperature. Large homes or commercial buildings may have multiple thermostats and heating zones, controlled by powered dampers. A digital thermostat can be programmed to activate the gas furnace at certain times. For example, a resident may want the temperature in their dwelling to rise 15 minutes before returning from work.|$|R
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{walls are}} {{constructed}} of load bearing masonry with stucco coating scored to resemble stone. All four elevations of the two-story rectangular building have two-story porticos with Doric columns and pedimented gables also constructed of load bearing masonry with stucco coating. The {{front and rear}} porticos have six columns and the side portico have four columns. An entrance to {{the first and second}} floors is located on each facade. The entrances on the second floor open onto balconies with cast iron railings. The corners of the building are accentuated with massive Doric pilasters. The first floor windows are six-over-nine double hung sash with iron shutters found on each side. The second floor windows are nine-over-nine double hung sash without shutters. Cast iron pediments top each window and entrance. Some of the buildings original innovations such as the <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> were cut due to cost restraints. The Building, from its massive timber attic framing to the handmade brick and mortar that form its walls, is constructed almost entirely of locally produced materials. The cast iron detailing of the window surrounds speak to the early pioneer days of the Industrial Revolution and modern prefabrication techniques.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{controlled}} combustion of blends of biomass materials and coals was conducted. Crushed limestone {{was added to the}} blends as an absorbent for sulfur oxides. The samples were combusted in quartz-fiber crucibles in a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> Combustion at different times and temperatures were studied. The amount of carbon, hydrogen, and sulfur in the residues, as well as the amount of ash formed, were used as measures of combustion efficiency. The optimum temperature for combustion of most blends was found to be in the 700 - 800 °C range. A study of methods for determining the amounts of inorganic and organic carbon in combustion residues was performed. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method D 1756 for inorganic carbon yielded accurate results but is tedious and requires a great deal of skill. An alternative method for determining inorganic carbon in combustion residues was developed...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the most}} widely used {{residential}} humidification technologies are <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> mounted bypass wetted media, spray mist, and steam humidifiers. They all use city water as a water source and require furnace heat or electricity to evaporate the water. Mineral deposition, white dust, and microbial growth problems are associated with these humidifiers. For commercial building humidification, de-mineralized water is typically used for humidification equipment like steam heat exchangers, fogging system, electric, and ultrasonic humidifiers. Therefore, in addition to the energy consumption for the water evaporation, energy is also needed to produce the high quality de-mineralized water. An innovative technology called Transport Membrane Humidifier (TMH), has been developed by the authors to humidify home air without external water and energy consumption, while simultaneously recovering waste heat from the home furnace flue gas to enhance the furnace efficiency. The TMH technology is based on our previous extensive study on nanoporous membrane water vapor separation from combustion flue gas, and a design for residential home humidification application was first developed. It has been proved by both laboratory prototype testing for long term performance, and by two occupied single family home demonstrations for two heating seasons. The technology can provide whole house humidification without any external water consumption, {{and at the same time}} boost the furnace efficiency. Compared with conventional furnace mounted humidifiers, the TMH does not need additional furnace fuel for the water evaporation, no white dust in the home, no microbial growth since there is no standing water involved. Therefore, it is an innovative technology that can provide energy saving, water saving and healthy building humidification...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{liquefied}} natural gas on pollutant emissions was evaluated experimentally with used and new appliances in the laboratory and with appliances installed in residences, targeting information gaps from previous studies. Burner selection targeted available technologies that are projected to comprise the majority of installed appliances over the next decade. Experiments were conducted on 13 cooktop sets, 12 ovens, 5 broiler burners, 5 storage water heaters, 4 <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> 1 wall furnace, and 6 tankless water heaters. Air-free concentrations and fuel-based emission factors were determined for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide, {{and the number of}} (predominantly ultrafine) particles over complete burns?including transient effects (device warm-up and intermittent firing of burners) following ignition [...] and during more stable end-of-burn conditions. Formaldehyde was measured over multi-burn cycles. The baseline fuel was Northern California line gas with Wobbe number (a measure of fuel energy delivery rate) of 1320 - 1340; test fuels had Wobbe numbers of roughly 1390 and 1420, and in some cases 1360. No ignition or operational problems were observed during test fuel use. Baseline emissions varied widely across and within burner groups and with burner operational mode. Statistically significant emissions changes were observed for some pollutants on some burners...|$|R
5000|$|Forced draught: draught is {{obtained}} by <b>forcing</b> <b>air</b> into the <b>furnace</b> {{by means of}} a fan (FD fan) and duct-work. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace. Forced draught furnaces usually have a positive pressure.|$|R
40|$|Small {{combined}} {{heat and}} power generators {{have the potential}} to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of residential buildings. Recently, much attention has been given to these units. To date, the majority of studies in this field have concentrated on the steady operational performance of a specific generator type, and the available computer models have largely been theoretical in nature. The main goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of the latest {{combined heat and power}} generators, when integrated into Canadian residential homes. A fair comparison of four 1 kW (electrical) units was made. The combined heat and power units studied were based on PEM fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell, Stirling Engine, and internal combustion engine energy converters. This study utilized recent test data in an attempt to evaluate the most efficient method of integrating the combined heat and power units into residential houses. Start-up, shut down, and load change transients were incorporated into the simulations. The impact of load variations due to building thermal envelope differences and varying building heating system equipment was evaluated. The simulations were evaluated using TRNSYS software. The building heat demands were determined with eQuest hourly building simulation software. All of the combined heat and power units under study were capable of providing a net annual benefit with respect to global energy and greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel cells offer the highest integrated performance, followed closely by the internal combustion engine and lastly the Stirling engine. Annual global energy savings up to 20 %, and greenhouse gas savings up to 5. 5 tonnes per year can be achieved compared to the best conventional high efficiency appliances. Heat demand influences performance greatly. As the thermal output of the generator unit approaches half of the average building thermal demand, the system design becomes critical. The system design is also critical when integrating with a <b>forced</b> <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> Only the PEM fuel cell unit produces clear global energy and emissions benefits when operating in the summertime...|$|E
40|$|The Radiant Demonstration Program (RDP) was devel-oped for the {{management}} association of a large retirement single-family housing community in the Northeast {{for the purpose of}} providing comparative data for heating system retrofit selection.

50|$|A cheaper {{alternative}} to hot water or steam heat is <b>forced</b> hot <b>air.</b> A <b>furnace</b> burns fuel oil, which heats {{air in a}} heat exchanger, and blower fans circulate the warmed air through a network of ducts to the rooms in the building. This system is cheaper because the air moves {{through a series of}} ducts instead of pipes, and does not require a pipe fitter to install. The space between floor joists can be boxed in and used as some of the ductwork, further lowering costs.|$|R
5000|$|Black {{sugar is}} a form of {{crystalline}} precipitate or a particulate pollution by-product unique from creosote caused by the burning of low grade coal in the 1940-1960s. The outgas from burning coal would be a by-product (burning coal was used in residential <b>forced</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>furnaces)</b> for the heating of family housing. Black sugar was often found on porches and the cold ductwork and caused the high carbon, soot-loaded gas to precipitate on the floors and walls and crystallize. Outward appearance was that of very fine, shiny coal, but would not combust when exposed to flames. After a time, the crystalline material would become powdered, to the consistency of white cane sugar, but retain a fine, shiny, black texture, thus the name [...] "black sugar". The material would often be cleaned from duct work by chimney sweeps or cleaning staff on a regular basis in the Beaver-Ambridge-Monaca area of Pennsylvania along the Ohio River near Pittsburgh.|$|R
40|$|The common {{techniques}} used {{to heat the}} soil, such as buried tubing heated with circulating hot water or buried electric heating cables, are a substantial and expensive modification of the typical greenhouse. Additional heating and control systems are required. Such methods {{are unlikely to be}} used by growers if there is only marginal benefit in terms of increased yield. Here, we describe a simpler method for heating soil that makes use of the <b>forced</b> hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> that is used to heat the greenhouse air. The only modification to the greenhouse was burial of air ducts underneath raised beds of soil. Experiments were conducted in a greenhouse at Malerba's Farm in Norwich CT. The greenhouse area was 30 x 96 ft, covered with a double layer of 6 -mil polyethylene film supported by steel hoops at 4 -ft spacing. It was heated by a 90 kilowatt oil-fired, forced-air furnace located in the south-west corner of the house. The furnace was activated by a thermostat if the air in the greenhouse cooled below 61 F. Fans for horizontal air flow helped maintain a uniform air temperature throughout the greenhouse. The soil was heated by blowing <b>air</b> from the <b>furnace</b> through buried <b>air</b> ducts (Figure 1).

50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker.

This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which <b>forces</b> hot <b>air</b> from the <b>furnace</b> to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the <b>air</b> in the <b>furnace</b> reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat.

According to the analysis, the economical temperature range of the heat exchangers is narrower as the inlet air temperature rises. When the air temperature difference keeps constant, the average heat exchange area increases as the inlet air temperature rises. When the inlet air temperature keeps constant, the average heat exchange area increases gradually as the air temperature difference rises. Then the average heat exchange area exceeds the economical temperature range and approaches infinity quickly. The analytical method of economic performance can be applied to the design and model selection of two-stage heat exchanger of high-temperature and high-capacity hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace...</b>|$|R
