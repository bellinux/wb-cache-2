5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
25|$|In May 1994, right-wing extremist Masakatsu Nozoe fired {{a gunshot}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of a Tokyo hotel where Hosokawa {{was giving a}} speech, in {{apparent}} protest at Hosokawa's statements.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, {{police arrested}} a peeping tom in the Lusty Lady who had climbed {{up from a}} viewing booth <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> crawl space overhead, then partly crashed through the glass ceiling above the stage.|$|E
50|$|Elaborate wooden coffers (藻井 zǎojǐng) {{bordered by}} a round, square, or polygon frame with its {{brackets}} projecting inward and upward from its base were used around the 7th century. Deeply recessed panels {{shaped like a}} well (square at the base with a rounded top) were fitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling's</b> wooden framework. <b>The</b> center panel of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was decorated with water lilies or other water plants. The relationship of the name to water {{has been linked to}} an ancient fear that wooden buildings would be destroyed by fire and that water from the zǎojǐng would prevent or quell the fire's flames.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 he {{designed}} a new display case concept [...] "Ice Cube Gliding Furniture System". It's involves attachment to a ceiling of rails or fixed anchoring points. The rails are drawn steel profiles and {{are made in}} Austria. Electricity, sound systems (emergency) lighting systems an alarm systems are built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings.</b> <b>The</b> suspended display cases can be moved manually or by remote control. The light source itself is invisible and the system allows an object to be lit without its throwing a shadow. Ice Cube won the [...] "1998 Provincial Prize for Artistic Craft and Industrial Design" [...] for the province of West Flanders. The system is being applied in the Musical Instrument Museum in Brussels.Many of his works were shown at: ...|$|R
25|$|A {{pyramidal}} top, {{which in}} all cases is very much ruined, but which must have been originally up to 13 m. high, constructed in many small steps (rise and tread about equal at around 0.2-0.25 m.). The top is mostly solid masonry, but in those jedars that contain funerary chambers, removable steps on one side conceal a passage leading down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chambers, <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> of which may protrude up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top.|$|R
25|$|Antoine Bell-Rogers robs {{owner of}} El Mexicano {{restaurant}} in Manchester at gunpoint, firing one shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and {{one into the}} floor between the owner's legs, while Michael K. Addison robs a customer at knifepoint of $300 and a cell phone.|$|E
25|$|The {{pendulum}} is withdrawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and {{the walls}} become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him slowly {{toward the center of}} the room and the pit. As he loses his last foothold and begins to topple in, he hears a roar of voices and trumpets, the walls retract, and an arm pulls him to safety. The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies' hands.|$|E
25|$|The Central Hearing Facility was {{completed}} in October 1987, and used {{for the first time}} in January 1988. Located on the second floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, the two-story high room has studio-quality television lighting built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Booths built into the sides of the room are elevated and can accommodate television camera crews. Above them are glassed-in booths where television reporters and news presenters can report from without disturbing the proceedings below.|$|E
6000|$|At last, one afternoon, Bill {{looked up}} from his work, hit his thigh a slap which {{produced}} a pistol-shot crack that echoed up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> high <b>ceiling</b> of <b>the</b> cell, as he exclaimed, [...] "I've got it!" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1606, Pope Paul V {{assigned}} the basilica {{to the order}} of Clerics Regular Minor. Cosimo Fanzago completely renovated the interior in the 17th century, including conversion of the lateral aisles of <b>the</b> basilica <b>into</b> chapels. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> was also frescoed by the Neapolitan Mometto Greuter.|$|R
50|$|Five {{decorative}} paintings inset <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plaster <b>ceiling</b> {{of a room}} {{designed by}} James Gibbs for a house in Henrietta Street, London, are attributed to Damini. The entire room, dating from around 1727-32 is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|R
25|$|While the {{negotiations}} were still going on, another incident occurred inside the residence. Three Argentine tactical divers {{who survived the}} first skirmish along the compound inadvertently alerted Major Noott to their presence, while they had been preparing to leave their hiding place. The Major fired his Sterling submachine gun <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the maid's room. According to British reports, the stunned commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground. They became the first Argentine prisoners of war of the Falklands War, although by then Governor Hunt had already {{been in contact with}} Argentine officials negotiating the terms of surrender.|$|E
25|$|A study {{confirmed}} that bats, {{when they are}} able to see, prefer to use their vision over echolocation. In the experiment, these bats were put in a mesh greenhouse and observed at dawn, day, dusk, and at night. The bats consistently ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and walls of the greenhouse at dawn, day, and dusk while trying to fly out, but at night when they were forced to rely solely on the echolocation, they avoided the ceiling and walls without a problem. The pulses emitted by the bat are all audible to humans, and the bat only emits pulses through the mouth.|$|E
25|$|Another room, {{designed}} by Michael Inchbald, where QE2s advanced interior design was demonstrated {{was the first}} class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above {{to deal with the}} otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Michael Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.|$|E
2500|$|For the 747-8, Boeing {{proposed}} {{some changes}} to the interior layout of the aircraft. [...] The -8I's upper deck is lengthened compared to the 747-400. Most noticeable is the curved stairway to the upper deck and a more spacious main passenger entrance. The 747-8's main cabin uses an interior {{similar to that of}} the 787. Overhead bins are curved, and the center row is designed to look as though it is attached to <b>the</b> curved <b>ceiling,</b> rather than integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling's</b> curve like on the 777. The windows are also of similar size to the type used on the 777, which are 8% larger than those on the current 747-400s. The 747-8 features a new solid-state light-emitting diode (LED) lighting system, which can create mood lighting.|$|R
500|$|Seven rooms still possess {{elements}} {{of their original}} plasterwork, which the historian Peter Smith has described as [...] "the most perfect and the most complete memorial to Elizabethan Wales", and their original wooden carved panels that line the walls. The plasterwork includes extensive heraldry, badges and symbols: in the upper north range alone, 22 different heraldic emblems are molded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and walls. <b>The</b> gatehouse shows the royal arms, as do the great chamber and the parlour, probably because they were intended to host senior guests. The badges of numerous monarchs are included throughout the house, including those of Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV and Henry VII. The badges of other prominent nobles, such as Robert Dudley, are also featured in the house.|$|R
50|$|Shabolovskaya has pylons punctuated on {{all four}} faces by {{projecting}} piers and faced with white marble. The piers on the transverse faces of the pylons extend upward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vaulted <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> outer walls are clad in incongruously dark corrugated metal which contrasts sharply with the bright white of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and pylons. At {{the end of the}} platform is a backlit stained glass panel on the theme of radio and television broadcasting. The station was designed by I.G. Petukhova, V.P. Kachurinets, N.I. Demchinsky, and Yu.A. Kolesnikova.|$|R
25|$|Sometime around 9:15 PM, police {{officers}} {{burst into the}} Lakeview Tavern and ordered the 10 staff and customers to lie on the floor. More police burst into the bar, and forced the seven men and three women into the basement. The officers fired repeatedly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and shot tear gas into the basement before locking the staff and customers in. Eyewitnesses said John Pegues, a tavern patron, {{was shot in the}} leg by police at this time, which an official chronology later said occurred at 9:30 PM. Patrolman Anthony Sherbinski, who rushed to the second floor to fire at snipers from the second floor window, was shot and wounded by return fire at the same time. The bar staff and patrons were not released from the basement until 10:15 PM. All the individuals were roughly handled by police, with most of the men being pistol-whipped. All ten were taken to the Fifth District Police station and locked up. Pegues was not given medical attention until 5:00 AM.|$|E
25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back through the walnut paneled dining room to either the drawing room or into the library. Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> At night this room, like the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced onto this courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace opened onto a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{continued to}} escalate as a superior {{court ruled that}} neither Alonzo or Robertson should be seated until situation was resolved. They then forwarded {{the case to the}} Indiana Supreme Court who ruled in favor of Robertson. On the morning of February 24, Robertson entered the Senate chamber to take his seat, but as soon as he walked through the door, he was attacked by several Democratic Senators who rushed him and beat him to the floor. The Senate leader ordered him removed from the chamber by guards, who then locked him out. The Republicans immediately went wild, attacking their nearest Democrat. The fight continued for several minutes until one Democrat pulled a gun and fired it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> threatening to start killing Republicans, ending the fight but making the rest of the building aware of it. The brawl soon spread to the House of Representatives and throughout the building as Republicans began to attack Democrats. Unlike the Senate, the rest of the building had a strong Republican majority, and the Democrats were soon overwhelmed. Six-hundred Republicans then beat down the door of the Senate Chamber and dragged out the Democratic Senators, threatening to kill them. Gray ordered police and other officials to break up the fight, which ended after nearly a full four hours of fighting.|$|E
5000|$|Area {{ground support}} {{is used to}} prevent major ground failure.

There are three categories of rock bolt, differentiated by how they engage the host rock. [...] They are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the walls}} of the drawing room, Morris had wanted a mural {{featuring}} a series of scenes from the fifteenth-century Middle English romance of Sir Degrevant. Ultimately, three were executed by Burne-Jones, and survive today; they feature Morris as king and Jane as queen. Over the fireplace, Morris had inscribed a Latin motto, [...] "Ars longa vita brevis", meaning [...] "Life is short, but art endures." [...] The settle from Red Lion Square was installed here, atop of which was fashioned a minstrela' gallery designed for Christmas concerts.Designs were pricked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> and then painted with simple, bold patterns. Commenting on the designs being introduced by his friend, in February 1862 Burne-Jones wrote that [...] "Top Morris thrives through bandy, and is slowly making Red House the beautifullest place on Earth." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1892 {{core of the}} {{building}} incorporates two large cells, each with an exercise yard and two smaller cells with a single L-shaped yard. Exercise yards are enclosed by concrete walls, {{three and a half}} metres in height. Each of the yards is separately entranced by iron doors with peep holes and large draw bolt locks. In each of the four 1892 cells, railway iron rails are imbedded horizontally in concrete piers between the top of the external walls and <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> providing ventilation. <b>The</b> remand cell has railway iron rails spanning the room {{at the top of the}} walls spaced 25 centimetres apart, the ends being imbedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> walls. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> are lined with tongue and groove hardwood boards.|$|R
500|$|Pullman-Standard and Bombardier each built 25 {{dedicated}} lounge cars, dubbed [...] "Sightseer" [...] lounges. Windows wrap upward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> providing lateral {{views of}} scenery along the train's route. This design element {{was drawn from}} the Hi-Level lounges and the Seaboard Air Line's Sun Lounges. The Superliner I lounge weighs the Superliner II lounge weighs [...]|$|E
500|$|The Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, {{and rises}} some [...] above {{the level of}} the {{surrounding}} square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. Set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the [...] "Xuanyuan Mirror". In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as Emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as coronations, investitures, and imperial weddings.|$|E
500|$|After {{previously}} dry conditions, severe flooding {{also occurred}} in West Virginia, amplified by the mountainous terrain. Record discharge rates were observed at 25gauging stations, and 27stations along rivers {{were at least}} 100year events, setting records along the Potomac and Monongahela rivers, among several others. While washing away large rocks, some streams changed their channels due to the high volume of water. Near Petersburg, the South Branch Potomac River crested at [...] and produced a record discharge of , and the peak discharge at Franklin was nearly three times the previous record. At {{five of the six}} gauging stations along the Potomac, there were new records for discharge rates. Along the Potomac, the floodwaters collected behind dams, causing 21 to exceed the capacity designed to withstand a 100-year flood. All five stations along the Greenbrier River recorded a new record discharge rate, as did all five along the Tygart Valley River. The flash flooding caused the Bloomington Reservoir to rise [...] in 30hours. Several caves were flooded, causing high amounts of erosion and damaging some speleothems. After the flooding, Mystic Cave in Pendleton County had tree branches wedged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and a layer of sand on the floor.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{interior}} {{is based on}} a basilica plan, designed as a Latin cross, and is divided into a nave, two aisles with stained-glass windows and a short transept. The large nave is 100 metres long and gives an impression of austerity. There is a trompe l'oeil effect by which towards the apse the nave seems longer than its actual length. The slender compound piers between the nave and the aisles are progressively closer the deeper <b>the</b> observer moves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nave. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> in <b>the</b> vault consists of pointed arches with the four diagonal buttresses in black and white.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the kitchen, laundry and bathrooms, rooms have split bamboo ceilings with ceiling lights and fans set in patterned cane or bamboo panels. Architraves and skirtings are also of bamboo, as is <b>the</b> door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio. This use of split bamboo is a particularly striking feature of the house. A long strip of what appears to be batik is set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio <b>ceiling.</b> <b>The</b> interior timber-framed floor is lined generally with timber boards.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us go home, sisters!' cries the Prince. Scarcely {{had they}} entered the palace when the thunder crashed, <b>the</b> roof burst <b>into</b> a blaze, <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> split in twain, and in flew an eagle. The Eagle smote upon the ground and became a brave youth.|$|R
2500|$|... 10 March 1994: an off-duty RUC officer (John Haggan) {{was shot}} dead by the IRA at the Dunmore Greyhound Stadium, off Antrim Road, Belfast. The officer was in the lounge {{when he was shot}} in the head by an IRA {{volunteer}} and shot again as he lay on the ground. A second IRA volunteer fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> to cover their escape.|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 2013, gunman Carnell Marcus Moore of Beaumont, Texas, {{fired shots}} from a Glock {{semi-automatic}} pistol <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of terminal B. A Homeland Security officer fired upon and wounded Moore {{in the right}} shoulder before Moore shot and killed himself. There was an AR-15 rifle in a suitcase that was not used, while a suicide note was found stating he had a [...] "monster within" [...] and he wanted police to stop him before he hurt others.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} Fireballs release, the band were already {{performing}} songs {{planned for the}} next album. One song (which later became [...] "Highway Star") was performed at the first gig of the Fireball tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: [...] "How {{do you go about}} writing songs?" [...] Three months later, in December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record Machine Head. The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention gig, caused by a man firing a flare gun <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song [...] "Smoke on the Water". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hotel.|$|E
50|$|The theater's immense height (ground {{level to}} fly height is 100 ft; ground level to {{top of the}} masts is 152 ft) allows the scenic and acrobatic {{equipment}} to be stored in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> As another first for Cirque du Soleil, the trapeze net is installed mechanically with no visible stagehands as it is lowered <b>into</b> place from <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After {{the death}} of Siegel, Cohen became enraged {{and went to the}} Hotel Roosevelt (the hotel in which it was rumored that Siegel's killers were staying) and fired his two [...]45 caliber pistols <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lobby <b>ceiling</b> {{demanding}} <b>the</b> murderers of Siegel to face him.
