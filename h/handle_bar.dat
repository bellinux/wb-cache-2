2500|$|Young {{grew up in}} the Hiram Clarke {{neighborhood}} of Houston, Texas, where he was primarily raised by his mother and his grandmother. His father, Vincent Young Sr., missed much of Vince's college career due to a 2003 burglary conviction and prison sentence. Young credits his mother and grandmother for keeping him away from the street gangs. At the age of seven, Young was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle at the corner of Tidewater and Buxley, streets in his Houston neighborhood. The accident nearly killed him, leaving him hospitalized for months after the bicycle's <b>handle</b> <b>bar</b> went into his stomach. Today, he credits this event for making him into a [...] "tougher" [...] individual. Young wore the #10 to show love and respect for his mother, Felicia Young, whose birthday is June 10. Young attended Dick Dowling Middle School in Hiram Clarke. Some of Young's friends were a part of the [...] "Hiram Clarke Boys," [...] a local street gang; many of those friends {{died as a result of}} their activities. Young's mother confronted him after he had been involved in a fight between gangs, and told him that he needed to change his behavior.|$|E
