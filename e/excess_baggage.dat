40|$|Abstract | A {{software}} repository provides a central information source for understanding and reengineering code in a software project. Complex reverse engineering tools {{can be built}} by analyzing information stored in the repository without reparsing the original source code. The most critical design aspect of a repository is its data model, which directly a ects how e ectively the repository supports various analysis tasks. This paper focuses on the design rationales behind a data model for a C++ {{software repository}} that supports reachability analysis and dead code detection at the declaration level. These two tasks are frequently needed in large software projects to help remove <b>excess</b> software <b>baggage,</b> select regression tests, and support software reuse studies. The language complexity introduced by class inheritance, friendship, and template instantiation in C++ requires a carefully designed model to catch all necessary dependencies for correct reachability analysis. We examine the major design decisions and their consequences in our model and illustrate how future software repositories can be evaluated for completeness at a selected abstraction level. Examples are given to illustrate how our model also supports variants of reachability analysis: impact analysis, class visibility analysis, and dead code detection. Finally, wediscuss the implementation and experience of our analysis tools on a few C++ software projects...|$|R

40|$|A {{common theme}} found in postcolonial {{histories}} {{of art education}} is the influence of dominant cultures {{and the impact of}} theories and practices across political, social, educational and artistic divides. In most cases the pressure for change occurs in a one-way direction, which reflects a difference in power and authority and a capacity to adapt to changing situations in response to perceived needs. The enviable or the exotic is hard to resist, especially if there is a desire to look beyond immediate circumstances in the quest to improve things. Effective change, however, is hard to manage if the source of change is believed to reside with others. Importing theories of art education from other cultural geographies therefore creates problematic patterns because art education theories do not travel well. Whether viewed as a colonial artifact in the past, or as a global commodity today, art education theories carry with them <b>excess</b> conceptual <b>baggage</b> that is difficult to dislodge. This is not a surprise, for any educational theory has its own provenance, position, and praxis, and these are crafted in response to particular needs and contexts. Curriculum theory in art education, for instance, comes equipped with definitions of art, assumptions about cultural values and the role of art, and descriptions of art learning and art teaching. If art education theories resist migration, is this the case with art ideas generally? Perhaps it is ideas rather than the theories that grow and flourish in othe...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. South Africa {{has already}} {{moved into a}} post-apartheid society, but its {{education}} system is till to date not yet fully transformed. Though {{the names of the}} various former education departments in the existing provinces have changed, because of the change in government, the integration is not completed yet. As a result, former "white" education departments and the former Department of Education and Training (DET) have been formally integrated, but in reality they are still separate. There are a number of differences among the schools of the different departments. For example, the schools which were previously controlled by the Transvaal Education Department (TED) are still maintaining the status quo in terms of curricula, syllabi, governance, appraisal and many other issues. Similarly all the schools which were previously controlled by the DET, also maintain their status quo regarding curricula, syllabi and governance. To just prove a point: in the black schools, governing bodies are presently transformed where all stakeholders are involved, whereas in the white schools, learners are excluded from governance; the names also differ: some are known as PTSA's (Parents, Teachers, and Students Associations) and others just management councils. The question is whether a new education dispensation can respond to broad social, economical and political goals, without continuing to be just political - that is, controlled by a particular ideology, not necessarily supported by all members of the society the education system serves. This is our past and present experience. This study hopes to contribute to the search for that common purpose, by considering the process by which we in South Africa Might prepare ourselves for that future education, and contribute to {{it in a way that}} is consistent with its long-term goals. There are several crises in education that are affecting the teaching and learning process directly or indirectly countrywide, but particularly in the schools previously controlled by the DET as well as former TBVC (Transkei/Bophuthatswana/Venda/Ciskei) states' schools. There have been genuine attempts on the part of government to resolve the education crises through negotiations with communities, political structures, religious structures, non-government organisations, teacher unions and student organisations. In spite of all these efforts, very little progress has been made so far. Tensions are still rife between the education authorities and the different stakeholders or structures. In the various schools now under the jurisdiction of provincial education departments, the picture is one of continuing deterioration in the relationships between the department and its teachers and pupils. The serious disruptions and ups and downs in attendance, especially in the rural schools, resulted in the total breakdown of the teaching-learning environment in most schools. Teachers are dispirited, pupils are restless, demotivated and disturbed by what is going on around them. The general environment is not conducive to learning at all. Regular learning habits have broken down, and discipline is loose or non-existent. Discipline has collapsed as a result of the abolition of corporal punishment in the schools by the government. The problem is that no alternative forms of punishment have been put into place to maintain discipline in the schools. These measures taken by the government have negative implications. There is now little respect for teachers as well as education authorities. Even where it is warranted - and sometimes it is not warranted - many teachers have given up trying to survive in the classroom. Those who try to impose punishment, are threatened or assaulted by students. Teachers, on the other hand, are also insubordinate to their immediate superiors or authorities. Lawlessness is the order of the day in the schools. Departmental professional supervision is meagre and some schools are "no-go areas" for departmental officials and inspectors of education. A further disturbing factor is the influence in education of the young people not in school. The drop-outs become street children who engage themselves in criminal activities such as burglary, car hijackings, alcohol and drug abuse. The generally negative image of the teacher, held even among teachers themselves, contributes to the breakdown of the positive learning environment. They are under pressure, criticised from all sides for inadequacies or inefficiency - for which they are often not to blame - and treated by the government not as professionals, but instruments of policy. It is not surprising, therefore, that the morale, confidence and self-image of many are at low ebb. Both public and civil servants, including teachers, are from time to time engaged in strikes or meetings during school hours, hence the pupils' interest in school attendance and learning has lessened. The impact of the transformation process is confusing the minds of educators, pupils, the general public and the authorities. Pupils do not regard their teachers as their leaders and educators anymore, but as government stooges. Teachers, on the other hand, are also negative towards the authorities, because their plight for recognition as professionals is not addressed or receiving immediate attention. They are continuously demanding, amongst other things, autonomy in. their teaching profession, like all other professions. Furthermore, the conditions of service do not motivate teachers to dedicate themselves to their work. The enrolment in the schools had risen tremendously after the general elections of 1994, due to the free education call campaign made by the new government (see Table 5). The facilities available can therefore not cope with the demands of the resultant overcrowding. The schools are now understaffed, overcrowded, there are shortages of learning materials, furniture, classrooms and teaching aids (see Table 4). The culture of teaching and learning is far from being restored, if till to date some pupils are taught in the open air or in shacks. The teacher-pupil ratio is abnormally high, it ranges from 1 : 50 to 100 in most of the rural schools. As a result, teachers resort to teaching without evaluating pupils regularly. Both the national and provincial education departments' authority and influence are from time to time challenged by community groupings, teachers' associations, students' organisations, young people outside the schools, parents, churches, trade unions, the business community, political parties and economic forces. There is a growing realisation that there is no certainty that the democratic changes in government and political structures would necessarily lead to democracy in education. Broad agreement has to be sought and negotiated in South Africa and a commitment found to a common purpose in education and society. Without this, questions of control, power and <b>excess</b> ideological <b>baggage,</b> will continue to dominate education to its detriment and that of its users. In spite of all the circumstances and difficulties described above, the education authorities, parents, political parties and the general public expect good results at the end of every academic year. The people who are to produce good examination results are the educators and teachers whose status and professionalism have collapsed completely...|$|R

2500|$|Coming in {{the wake}} of the American debacle at Camden, Cowpens was a {{surprising}} victory and a turning point that changed the psychology of the entire war—"spiriting up the people", not only those of the backcountry Carolinas, but those in all the Southern states. As it was, the Americans were encouraged to fight further, and the Loyalists and British were demoralized. Furthermore, its strategic result—the destruction of an important part of the British army in the South—was incalculable toward ending the war. Along with the British defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain, Cowpens was a serious blow to Cornwallis, who might have defeated much of the remaining resistance in South Carolina had Tarleton won at Cowpens. [...] Instead, the battle set in motion a series of events leading to the end of the war. [...] Cornwallis abandoned his pacification efforts in South Carolina, stripped his army of its <b>excess</b> <b>baggage,</b> and pursued Greene's force into North Carolina. Skirmishes occurred at the Catawba River (February 1, 1781) and other fords.
