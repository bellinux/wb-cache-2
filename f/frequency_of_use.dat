The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis.

The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another difference is that chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed.

Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

In this research, the writer wants to find out the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Suroboyoan <b>of</b> those students and draw the relationship with their Suroboyoan listening comprehension scores. Besides, she is also eager to reveal which gender group produces higher score. The writer used descriptive-quantitative approach and the data were taken from fifteen male and fifteen female students from Kupang. In order to measure their listening comprehension scores, the writer used a multiple-choice question based on three conversations. In this research, the writer mainly <b>used</b> the theory <b>of</b> interaction focused on language use, second language acquisition, and social factors. From this research, the writer found out that students from Kupang who have a high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Suroboyoan achieved higher scores than the students who have a low <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> Suroboyoan [...] Moreover, the writer also discovered that female students achieved higher scores than male students.

40|$|Communicative {{strategies}} {{not only}} {{play an important}} role in communication but they also contribute to second language acquisition. Communicative strategies (CS) can help to keep the communication channel open, encourage hypothesis formation and automatization. The overall aim of this essay is to find out whether there is a relationship between Chinese English learners’ attitudes toward the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> communicative strategies and the reported <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> them in actual communication. Forty Chinese English majors are selected randomly to participate in this investigation. They were divided into two different groups according to their different level of language proficiency. The main methods of this essay are two questionnaires and an interview.   Based on the framework of achievement strategies and reduction strategies and through the investigation of the relationship between the attitude toward communicative strategies and the reported <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> them in communication, three tentative conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, a learner’s attitude of CS has some influence on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> CS. Secondly; Chinese learners of English tend to use reduction strategies most often. Finally, Chinese learners seldom use achievement strategies although they tend to believe the important role of achievement strategies in communication. What is more, this essay also analyzes the two groups of students’ different attitudes and different reported <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> CS and finds some reasons for those differences. After the above analyses, the essay categorizes three main factors which affect learners’ attitudes and their reported <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> CS. It includes the learner itself, the learning context, and the communication context...|$|R

[...] This could include phonological, {{as well as}} morphological and syntactic phenomena. Labov also developed variable rules analysis, with variable rules being those that all members of a speech community (presumably) possess but vary in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The latter concept met resistance from scholars {{for a number of}} reasons including the argument from critics that knowledge of rule probabilities was too far from speakers' competence. [...] Because of these problems, use of variable rules analysis died down by the end of the 1980s. Nevertheless, the linguistic variable is still used in sociolinguistics. For Labov, grouping variants together was justified by their tendency to fluctuate between each other within the same set of words. [...] For example, Labov presented the variants (among New York speakers) of the vowel of bad or dance: ...|$|E

The actual use and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of a substance, especially when that use may result in harmful consequences such as failure to fulfill major obligations at work or school, physical risk-taking, or even substance-related legal problems, are indicative of a substance's abuse potential.
