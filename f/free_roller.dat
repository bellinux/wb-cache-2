40|$|The {{fertilizer}} bagging line {{operation for}} packaging and conveying {{to the final}} delivery trucks {{was a source of}} problem for one fertilizer producer referred to here as Company “N”. This resulted in frequent maintenance activities from constant machine breakdown, loss of production, and the attendant loss in plant revenue. To overcome this, a technical study was conducted to address the problem. Plant site visit and technical inspection revealed the breakdowns were primarily due to fertilizer granules being trapped on the packaging/bagging conveyors, {{and as a result of}} fast acidic corrosion causing rust and eventual seizures of the conveyor rollers and lines. The resistances to <b>free</b> <b>roller</b> movement induce a drag load on the drive motors, with the additional loading causing failures of the electronic control sensors and stoppages. The unreliability of the bagging operations in the unplanned, repeated start-stop sequence in the packaging operation also led to safety concerns, with a few incidences of injuries being recorded. The engineered solution is presented in this report. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we purpose a new holonomic {{omni-directional}} {{mobile robot}} that {{can move on}} not only flat floors but also uneven environment. A prototype robot can move in omni-direction, run on the uneven floors and slopes, and pass over large steps. The robot has seven universal wheels that have twelve cylindrical <b>free</b> <b>rollers.</b> We adopt a passive suspension system that enable the robot to change {{the shape of the}} robot body in proportion to ground states without using actuators and sensors. We construct the prototype robot and analyse the kinematics of the robot. The performance of the prototype robot is verified through experiments.

40|$|A {{new type}} of holonomic omnidirectionul vehicle which {{consists}} of wheel mechanisms without <b>free</b> <b>rollers</b> but with conventional tires is presented. We first present a concept of the new driving wheel mechanism with a tire in the conventional style such QS a rubber tire or a pneumatic tire,"Offset Steered Driving Wheel". The configuration of the wheel has an offset distance between a wheel axle and a steering axle along a direction of wheel traveling. We then describe the kinematics and the control method of Offset Steered Driving Wheel to provide an omnidirectional and holonomic capability for a vehicle by actuating a wheel axis and a steering axis independently. The wheel is non-holonomic system however, we introduce a control strategy to avoid a non-holonomic constraint...|$|R

These products {{can be used for}} a variety of markets (offset printing, rotogravure, flexography and digital printing).Böttcher America can supply rollers to customers as either “exchange” or “recover”. The “Roller Recover Program” allows customers to send Böttcher America used rollers to be recovered with new rubber. A customer can also order rollers through the “Exchange Roller Program” and a press-ready roller will be shipped. The customer is billed for the rubber only and has 60 days to return the core(s).Böttcher is the OEM roller supplier to the major sheet-fed press manufacturers including Heidelberg, MAN Roland, KBA, Komori and Mitsubishi.Böttcher America has won two awards for its products. In 1993, the company won a GATF award in recognition of the glaze <b>free</b> <b>rollers</b> technology (79 Series Rubber Compounds). In 2005, Böttcher America won a new PIA/GATF award for its Chameleon rubber roller compound which enables printers to switch freely among different inks (conventional, UV or hybrid) without changing printing rollers.|$|R

40|$|Typical {{mobile robot}} {{structures}} (e. g., wheelchair or car-like robots) {{do not have}} the required mobility for common applications such as displacement in a corridor, hospital, office, etc. New structures based on the 'universal wheel' (i. e., a wheel equipped with <b>free</b> rotating <b>rollers)</b> have been developed to increase mobility. However, these structures have important drawbacks such as vertical vibration and limited load capacity. In order to predict both their kinematic and dynamic behaviours, the resort to a multibody approach has been envisaged in this paper and a so-called 'cam/follower' contact model has been developed to take the universal wheel/ground interface into account. An experimental comparison of the model as well as the simulation of three designs of universal wheels are proposed before concluding the paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|J 3 is a {{neutralizing}} Vhh, while lab 5 is an irrelevant Vhh (irr-Vhh). J 3 and lab 5 were polyhistidinylated (J 3 -His and lab 5 -His) for the non-covalent {{attachment to}} liposomes via nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) linkage. Meanwhile {{another form of}} J 3 (J 3 -cys) with extra cysteine in the C-terminus was generated for covalent conjugation to liposomes via interaction with a maleimide group. Vhhs were produced as described before [31]. Non-covalent immunoliposomes were produced by mixing Vhh-His with the liposome suspension in a 1 : 10  M ratio {{at room temperature for}} 1  h on a bench <b>roller.</b> <b>Free</b> thiol groups were generated by incubating J 3 -cys with 10  mM DTT for 30  min at room temperature. Covalent immunoliposomes were prepared via interaction between J 3 -cys and maleimide-derivatized lipid inserted in lipo 3. The mixture of J 3 -cys and liposomes with the maleimide group was allowed to conjugate at room temperature overnight. Unreacted maleimide groups were subsequently saturated by adding cysteine. The immunoliposomes were purified by running through a Sephadex G 50 column to remove excess cysteine or/and unbound protein.|$|R
