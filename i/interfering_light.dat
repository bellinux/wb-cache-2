40|$|<b>Interfering</b> <b>light</b> waves {{produce an}} optical {{interference}} pattern in any medium that interacts with light. This modulation of some physical parameter {{of the system}} acts as a classical holographic grating for optical radiation. When such a grating is produced through interaction of pulsed light waves with an optical transition, a transient grating is formed whose decay {{is a measure of}} the relaxation time of the excited state. Transient gratings can be formed in real space or in frequency space depending on the time ordering of the <b>interfering</b> <b>light</b> waves. The two gratings are related by a space-time transformation and contain complementary information on the optical dynamics of a system. The status of a grating can be probed by a delayed third pulse, which diffracts off this grating in a direction determined by the wave vector difference of the <b>interfering</b> <b>light</b> beams. This generalized concept of a transient grating can be used to interpret many picosecond-pulse optical experiments on condensed-phase systems. Examples of some low-temperature experiments will be presented. In principle, many of these experiments could also be performed by using stochastic broad-band excitation. In these nonlinear photon-interference experiments the time resolution is determined by the correlation time of the light source rather than its pulse width. ...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{projection}} synthesis can be {{used for}} phase-probability-distribution measurement, optical-state truncation and preparation. The method relies on <b>interfering</b> optical <b>lights,</b> which is a major challenge in experiments performed by pulsed light sources. In the pulsed regime, the time frequency overlap of the <b>interfering</b> <b>lights</b> plays a crucial role on the efficiency of the method when they have different mode structures. In this paper, the pulsed mode projection synthesis is developed, the mode structure of <b>interfering</b> <b>lights</b> are characterized and the effect of this overlap (or mode match) on the fidelity of optical-state truncation and preparation is investigated. By introducing the positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) for the detection events in the scheme, the effect of mode mismatch between the photon-counting detectors and the incident lights are also presented.

40|$|International audienceAbstract: The {{application}} of planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH to high-pressure liquid oxygen/gaseous methane flames is investigated in this article. As pressure is increased, the maximum level of OH fluorescence decreases while an <b>interfering</b> <b>light</b> intensity increases. It is shown that suitable data {{can only be}} obtained by properly tuning the detection scheme. Narrowband filtering of OH fluorescence is required to reduce the level of interfering signals. An analysis of the <b>interfering</b> <b>light</b> indicates that it is associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluorescence originating from a region surrounding the flame. OH and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluorescence signal amplitudes become comparable at a pressure of 2. 5 MPa which constitutes an upper bound for standard imaging. Below that limit the flame is well characterized and features thin, wrinkled OH layers developing {{in the vicinity of}} the liquid oxygen jet. The initial flame sheet is continuous but it becomes highly corrugated further downstream when the liquid oxygen jet breaks down. The flame edge standoff distance is greater than a few LOx post lip sizes indicating that stabilization is less well achieved than in the case of liquid oxygen/hydrogen flames where combustion typically begins at less than one lip size from the injector...|$|E

30|$|On {{illuminating}} {{two points}} on the leaf, two independent speckle fields were generated that interfere to make a random interference speckle pattern as shown in Figure  6 (A). The speckle patterns were acquired by a CCD camera (XC- 75, Sony Corp., Japan) set {{at a distance of}} 83  mm from the leaf. An interference filter (IF) was attached in front of the CCD camera to suppress the background light and select the probing light. The IF worked as a band-pass filter having a central wavelength of 633  nm with a bandwidth of 10  nm. A polarization filter (PF) was also used to maximize the interference signal. The distance d between the points of illumination on the leaf was set to be 3  mm. d can be adjusted by moving the prism P 2 (Suruga Seiki, Japan) along the optical axis. P 2 was mounted on a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) stage (E- 620, Physik Instrumente, Germany) was used to give a certain phase shift between the <b>interfering</b> <b>light</b> beams.
