5|$|The {{disposition}} {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf lashed his ships side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows projected beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all hands free to fight, that a barrier could be formed with the oars and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another advantage to the defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|E
25|$|Since the Norden was {{considered}} a critical wartime instrument, bombardiers were required {{to take an oath}} during their training stating that they would defend its secret with their own life if necessary. In case the bomber plane should make an emergency landing on enemy territory, the bombardier would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> the important parts of the Norden with a gun to disable it. As this method still would leave a nearly intact apparatus to the enemy, a thermite grenade was installed; the heat of the chemical reaction would melt the Norden into a lump of metal. The Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber was originally equipped with flotation bags in the wings to aid the aircrew's escape after ditching, but they were removed once the Pacific War began; this ensured that the aircraft would sink, taking the Norden with it.|$|E
500|$|As he {{toured the}} {{remainder}} of the hospital, Patton continued discussing Bennett's condition with Currier. Patton stated, [...] "I can't help it, it makes my blood boil to think of a yellow bastard being babied," [...] and [...] "I won't have those cowardly bastards hanging around our hospitals. We'll probably <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> them some time anyway, or we'll raise a breed of morons." ...|$|E

500|$|The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) {{announced}} in September 2011 that production had {{started for the}} special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011. Filming was disrupted on 30 September due to a 24-hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies. The opening sequence set {{in the corridors of}} a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. [...] Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Smith stated, [...] "It was a really tough shoot. Out in a forest, at night, and because there were children involved, some shooting schedules had to change radically, we'd often <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> through, no breaks– you get lunch at midnight or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E

The robbery scheme fails when an American john fights back (because he apparently {{does not understand}} Portuguese) so they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> him. [...] In the ensuing fight, Pixote accidentally shoots and kills Dito as well.|$|E
2500|$|... 2K Games {{launched}} a website titled [...] "Boob Tube" [...] {{to promote the}} game. The website features videos and features to download. On May 19, 2011, a flash game was released on the website titled Duke Nudem where players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> targets against a CPU bot [...] "woman" [...] of their choice, and if successful will {{have a piece of}} clothing taken off the girl until she is topless. However, if the player loses, the actress will act as though Duke has stripped naked. Additionally 2K released for iOS a Duke Nukem Forever Soundboard which includes a number of Duke Nukem's phrases to be played back.|$|E

2500|$|In the NBA (since 1954), Women's National Basketball Association (since 2006), and FIBA play (since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), {{the shot}} clock counts down 24 seconds, thus often {{being called the}} [...] "24-second clock." [...] If a shot is {{attempted}} and hits or enters the rim, or if the defensive team gains possession via a rebound, steal, or out-of-bounds play, the shot clock resets. [...] Failure by the offense to attempt a shot that hits the rim within the prescribed time results in a [...] "shot clock violation" [...] {{and a loss of}} possession to the other team. Three signals indicate when the shot clock expires—a shot clock signal, illuminated lights on the shot clock (NBA, FIBA, Euroleague, and many venues using an NBA-style transparent shot clock), and in the NBA and Euroleague only, a yellow LED light strip on the backboard. In the 2011–12 NBA season and 2014–15 Euroleague, the last five seconds of the shot clock were modified to include tenths of a second, allowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> and officials to determine any last-second shots easily. In the 2016-17 NBA season, a new 'official timekeeper' deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer Tissot introduced a new united official game clock/shot clock system, putting both timing systems under the same system for the first time. Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the 2017 season.|$|E
2500|$|Perrino was {{in regular}} contact with Bonanno crime family underboss Salvatore Vitale {{to whom he}} handed over the weekly {{proceeds}} from their racketeering ventures. When law enforcement finally came down on the newspaper's crooked workforce, Perrino was not arrested or indicted although Bonanno crime family members and several others {{were caught in the}} sting operation – making Salvatore Vitale nervous. A secret video camera placed in Perrino's office in late 1991 caught Perrino discussing his important role in the Bonanno crime family. It also taped Perrino and other Post employees discussing the finer points of bootlegging, newspaper theft and passing around loaded pistols to admire. Perrino was heard advising truck drivers, [...] "It's bad to carry a fuckin' piece in the car, you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> everybody," [...] as reported in [...] "The Newspaper Racket: Tough Guys and Wiseguys in the Truck Drivers Union" [...] in The Village Voice. Although Salvatore Vitale had not been named in the initial indictments, he thought that Perrino could become an informant because of his immense involvement with the rackets at the New York Post. Perrino's father-in-law, Nicholas Marangello, was incarcerated for racketeering {{as a result of the}} Donnie Brasco investigation at the time of his execution. Two of Perrino's executive co-workers, including his friend Director of Circulation, Anthony Michele, pleaded guilty to racketeering. A number of Bonanno crime family connected members of the Newspaper Mail Deliverer's Union later pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and were imprisoned at Riker's Island. Salvatore Vitale suggested that Richard Cantarella replace Perrino shortly before the racketeering investigation was revealed.|$|E

2500|$|Gabriel {{was shot}} on a JVC GY-HD101E digital video camera. Abbess praised the JVC’s versatility, small size {{and its ability}} <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at night. Another crucial {{advantage}} to digital video was its cheapness: [...] "Ten years ago, we couldn’t have made this movie, because we would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> on film. It would have been as boring as bat shit, because we would only <b>have</b> <b>had</b> money <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> a wide shot and two close ups before moving on.
