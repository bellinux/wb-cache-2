5|$|Sixty villages (including {{the large}} {{settlement}} of Dilman, which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas) were {{destroyed in the}} Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions. A destructive aftershock sequence affected many villages, and in some cases, damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock.

40|$|Cine {{films of}} brown {{pelicans}} flying in formation {{were used to}} measure altitudes and wing tip spacing (WTS, distance perpendicular to the flight path between wing tips of adjacent birds at maximum span) for birds flying in <b>ground</b> <b>effect,</b> and vertical displacements and WTS for birds flying out of <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> Views were near coplanar with the plane of flight paths, and maximum wing span was used for scale. Induced drag savings in <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> averaged 49 % for gliding. Average WTS varied considerably with no evidence for systematic positioning near an optimum. There were also no differences in average WTS between flapping and gliding {{in or out of}} <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> Vertical displacements out of <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> varied less than WTS but more than vertical displacements in <b>ground</b> <b>effect.</b> Few birds had wing beat frequencies similar to the bird ahead as would be needed to track vertical variation in trailing wing tip vortex positions.

40|$|Rotorcraft {{operating}} in <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> {{have been known}} to experience beneficial performance effects as well as operational difficulties during low speed forward flight. While these have been attributed to the formation of the ground induced wake, limited experimental investigations of the wake have been conducted. Difficulties in re-creating representative forward flight ground boundary conditions in wind tunnels have meant a lack of quantitative information on the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake. This research is based on experimentally investigating the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wakes of rotors in forward flight, to detail the fluid mechanics associated with the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake and to identify the influence of rotor parameters and ground boundary conditions on the formation of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted on wide regions of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake produced by a rotor model in a wind tunnel fitted with a moving ground. Results from this research showed the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake to consist of a flow separation boundary and a region of recirculation, formed by the rotor tip vortex system trailing along the ground plane. Unsteadiness of the wake was seen to result in a constantly evolving wake, and this was observed to affect the classification of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> flow regimes. Flow visualisation experiments conducted on the brownout phenomenon showed the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake features to influence the dust pick-up and transport mechanisms involved in the dust cloud formation. Experimental testing showed rotor parameters such as collective angles, rotor trim settings, rotor ground distance and root cut-out ratios to cause insignificant changes to the fluid mechanics of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake, affecting only the location of the wake features. <b>Effects</b> of <b>ground</b> boundary conditions on the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake fluid mechanics were observed to be most significant, affecting both the location and detailed structure of the wake features. Results from this research show that <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> experimental testing can be conducted in the wind tunnel environment and highlight the importance of accurately representing the ground boundary conditions during <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> experimental testing.

25|$|While {{the effects}} of a {{four-year}} drought limited the potential of landslides, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road cuts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. Highway 17 was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a rockfall along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to {{the effects of}} liquefaction, especially near the shore of San Francisco Bay (where its effects were severe in the Marina District) and {{to the west of the}} epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay.

25|$|The {{test was}} {{performed}} at 11:00 MST on August 9, 1968 at the Watching Hill blast {{range of the}} Defence Research Establishment Suffield, a permanent facility {{able to carry out}} large HE test up to 500 tons operated by the Defence Research Board. The charge was constructed of 31,676 blocks of TNT of various sizes mainly the 12x12x4 inch typically used in HE tests. Unlike previous 500-ton tests however, the charge was built as a sphere tangent to the ground, which would make it smaller in diameter than the 500-ton hemispheres but equal in yield. Detonation was accomplished with CE/TNT boosters placed in the center. The sphere was supported by styrofoam rings and blocks and once completed resembled a hemisphere atop a cylinder. After detonation, the flame front reached the charge surface in approximately half a second and produced a fireball and destructive overpressures. Debris up to ¾ inch in diameter continued to rain down for almost 8 minutes after detonation in the vicinity of ground zero. The resulting crater measuring 270 feet across filled rapidly with water and was subsequently excavated for studying the <b>ground</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E

The BT49 competes in class C, for post 1971 <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> cars. In 1999, Motor Sport magazine tested a BT49D from the series featuring [...] from its developed DFV at 11,200rpm, but the championship has since introduced rules to restrict engines to 10,500rpm to keep costs down. While the cars' original skirts can be kept, they must be set up such that there is [...] clearance beneath the car, a rule that removes most of the advantage of ground effect. The hydropneumatic suspension employed during 1981 is not permitted. The carbon-carbon brakes originally used in 1981 and 1982 are also banned and the cars must run with conventional brake pads and steel brakes. The cars use Avon slick tyres.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> in multirotors, that is, {{the change in}} the thrust generated by the rotors when flying close to the ground due to the interaction of the rotor airflow with the <b>ground</b> surface.
