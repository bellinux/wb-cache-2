25|$|On March 2 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Athens to for its second meeting with Georgia. Facing the largest second-half deficit of its so-far perfect season, Kentucky clamped down defensively, ripped off a 14 to 0 run and defeat Georgia 72 to 64. Georgia's Yante Maten tipped in a miss {{of his own}} shot on the second attempt to put the Bulldogs up 56 to 47 with just over 9 minutes remaining. Towns and Aaron Harrison were huge down the stretch, combining for 12 of the 14 points during the decisive run. Towns had seven, including a three-point play with 2:53 left that put Kentucky ahead to stay. Harrison chipped in with five, and Cauley-Stein {{came up with a}} huge dunk off a missed free throw to give the Wildcats a four-point play on one possession. On March 7 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face Florida on senior night in the regular season finale. Kentucky embraced its milestone following the 67 to 50 victory over the Gators. The Wildcats gathered at midcourt and donned their blue T-shirts with 31-0 Not <b>Done</b> <b>Yet</b> in white. Kentucky became the first team from a Power 5 conference to achieve a perfect record during the regular season in over twenty-five years.|$|E
500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're not <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> I think we got more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We {{have no idea what}} the future holds, but for now we are done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. They performed their final, sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E
500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> For me, it was a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening weekend}} box office total stood below {{not only the}} second {{weekends}} of Blades of Glory and Meet the Robinsons, but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the poorly reviewed Are We <b>Done</b> <b>Yet?.</b> In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that Grindhouse [...] "suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted Snakes on a Plane and Slither among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny." [...] Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's Kill Bill saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. [...] "Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time {{as a result of}} two back-to-back $60million grosses?" [...] he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films. The film's length—running more than three hours—also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, the band participated in three {{headlining}} tours {{and several other}} supporting tours. The first headlining tour, the Revolt Tour, began on April6 and spanned across the spring until May27, playing with Drive-A, New Medicine, 10 Years, and others at various House of Blues venues across North America. The second headlining tour for the album was the Endless Summer Tour with All That Remains and Hyro Da Hero which began in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and ended in Knoxville, Tennessee. The third tour was the World War III Tour, which the band called the biggest tour they had <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> The tour was co-headlined with Asking Alexandria with support acts We Came As Romans, D.R.U.G.S., and Borgore, with different local openers for each location. For supporting tours, the band began with the Nightmare After Christmas Tour with headliners Avenged Sevenfold and supporters Stone Sour and New Medicine on January 20, 2011, {{which was the first}} supporting tour for the album. Outside of official tours, the band played several festivals throughout 2011 including UFEST in Mesa, Arizona, Rockfest, and Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The band also played various holiday shows, such as a Cinco De Mayo show in Salt Lake City, Utah, with Flogging Molly and others.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, as well, RKO Pictures {{entered into}} a legal battle with Wall Street Financial Associates (WSFA). Hartley and Merrill claimed that the owners of WSFA fraudulently induced them into signing an {{acquisition}} agreement by concealing their [...] "cynical and rapacious" [...] plans to purchase RKO with the intention only of dismantling it. WSFA sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting RKO's majority owners from selling their interests in the company to any third parties. The WSFA motion was denied in July 2003, freeing RKO to deal with another potential purchaser, InternetStudios.com. In 2004, that planned sale fell through when InternetStudios.com apparently folded. The company's minimal involvement in new film production continues to focus on its remake rights: Are We <b>Done</b> <b>Yet?,</b> based on Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), was released in April 2007 to dismal reviews. Later in the year, RKO launched a horror division, Roseblood Movie Company. As of early 2010, Roseblood's mission had expanded, according to the RKO website, to encompass the [...] "popular horror/thriller genre ... youth-oriented feature-length motion pictures that are edgy, sensuous, scary and commercial." [...] The most recent RKO release are Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009), a remake of a 1956 RKO film directed by Fritz Lang and A Late Quartet (2012). A stage version of Top Hat toured Great Britain {{in the second half}} of 2011.|$|E

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not <b>done</b> <b>yet</b> figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E

2500|$|Dupri also {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility for}} a duet with Jackson and American singer Mariah Carey for the album. Carey commented in April 2006, [...] "He never {{talked to me about}} that, but if Jermaine has a concept, we should go and write something. I love Janet. I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen. [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re not <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking I might go back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|Normally contestants {{would be}} gonged by Red Symons well before they {{finished}} their performance. Each contestant was then given a score out of 10 {{by each of}} the judges. For most acts, Red, always the last to give his score, would usually give his trademark score of 2 along with a pithy and acidic comment. Other times he would give high scores when the performance really was particularly good (or poor!)—on several occasions he declared a performance the winning one, even if the others hadn't been <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> The winning contestant received a $500 cash prize, second received $250 and third received $100. [...] In the final years, the prizes were doubled and were sponsored by McDonald's restaurant chain.

2500|$|In March 2014, it was {{announced}} that Formula E was working with New York City authorities to bring a motor race to the area.

It's far from <b>done</b> <b>yet</b> but we are very optimistic. Our dream would be to have a race in New York." [...] Originally, planners considered Governors Island, Central Park, and Liberty State Park in Jersey City as possible locations for the track. However, these sites were not chosen since a Governors Island track would have been too costly; a Central Park track would have required demolishing trees; and Liberty State Park was outside the city limits. New York City deputy mayor Alicia Glen visited Paris in May 2016. After attending the ePrix, she lent her support to the New York City race with backing from the New York City Economic Development Corporation. A one-year contract to stage the event was signed with the option for a renewal every year for the next ten years.|$|E
