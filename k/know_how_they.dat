5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00 pm on 1 May, Bormann {{left the}} Führerbunker with SS doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur {{as members of}} one of the groups {{attempting}} {{to break out of the}} Soviet encirclement. Bormann carried with him a copy of Hitler's last will and testament. The group left the Führerbunker and travelled on foot via a U-Bahn tunnel to the Friedrichstraße station, where they surfaced. Several members of the party attempted to cross the Spree River at the Weidendammer Bridge while crouching behind a Tiger tank. The tank was hit by Soviet artillery and destroyed, and Bormann and Stumpfegger were knocked to the ground. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and several others eventually crossed the river on their third attempt. Bormann, Stumpfegger, and Axmann walked along the railway tracks to Lehrter station, where Axmann decided to leave the others and go in the opposite direction. When he encountered a Red Army patrol, Axmann doubled back. He saw two bodies, which he later identified as Bormann and Stumpfegger, on a bridge near the railway switching yard. He did not have time to check thoroughly, so he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> died. Since the Soviets never admitted to finding Bormann's body, his fate remained in doubt for many years.|$|E

Simon {{reported that he}} was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively {{on the first two}} albums: people wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.|$|E

Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened {{as a result of the}} upheaval.|$|E

500|$|A cast of Swedish and American actors {{contributed to}} the recording.

Translation of the lyrics was also handled in Sweden: [...] "Since I do not speak Swedish, I will never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> managed," [...] Russell Mael said, expressing his appreciation for the efforts of everyone involved to translate the tone and spirit of the Maels' original text into Swedish lyrics. Sparks and Wennersten communicated mainly via an FTP server, with Sparks sending Wennersten their musical material, and Wennersten sending the edited Swedish voice recordings back to Sparks. Sparks were {{very pleased with the}} results of the collaboration, and the fact that Swedish actor Jonas Malmsjö, playing Bergman, had starred in several Bergman productions, enabling him to bring this personal experience to his portrayal of Bergman.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Addabbo {{temporarily}} {{took over}} the role, first airing on April 6, 2001. To prepare for the role, he watched tapes of Nader's portrayal of Dimitri {{in order to see}} the relationships between Dimitri and other characters. Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried. [...] "I don't find it intimidating," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> can come to love a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn't find it intimidating at all." [...] Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed [...] "all-American good guys" [...] such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Lights Jim LeMay. A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader's return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go [...] "for storyline reasons", according to ABC's official statement.|$|E

[...] He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties, but was quick to point out [...] "you don't score because of the practising – keeping your nerve is more important." [...] Lehmann, who had been side-lined by Wenger {{during the course of the}} season, credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties, and described it as a [...] "big mental achievement."
