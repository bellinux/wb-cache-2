50|$|On April 12, 2015, the 153rd {{anniversary of}} the Great Locomotive Chase, the Marietta Daily Journal {{published}} an article advocating {{the transfer of the}} Texas to the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in <b>Kennesaw,</b> Georgia. Several <b>state</b> legislators indicated their support, arguing the locomotive was state property due to its association with the once-public W&ARR. Following the piece, the Georgia State Properties Commission requested a legal opinion from the State's Office of the Attorney General concerning the engine's ownership. The State Attorney General's office concluded that the Texas was property of the City of Atlanta given the evidence discovered, particularly citing the NC&StL's right to disposition of property as clarified in their 1890 and 1919 leases with the State of Georgia for the W&ARR. As a result, the donation of the Texas to the City of Atlanta on February 17, 1908 was a legally permissible transfer, meaning the City of Atlanta continues to hold ownership rights to the locomotive today.|$|R
