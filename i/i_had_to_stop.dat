I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
500|$|Morrison's {{influence}} {{can readily}} {{be heard in}} the music of a diverse array of major artists and according to The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001), [...] "his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, Bob Dylan. Echoes of Morrison's rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello". His influence includes U2 (Bono was quoted saying [...] "I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made The Unforgettable Fire because I didn't want his very original soul voice to overpower my own."); John Mellencamp ("Wild Night"); Jim Morrison; Joan Armatrading (the only musical influence she will acknowledge); Nick Cave; Rod Stewart; Tom Petty; Rickie Lee Jones (recognises both Laura Nyro and Van Morrison as the main influences on her career); Elton John; Graham Parker; Sinéad O'Connor; Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy; Bob Seger ("I know Bruce Springsteen was very much affected by Van Morrison, and so was I." [...] from Creem interview) ("I've Been Working"); Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners ("Jackie Wilson Said"); Jimi Hendrix ("Gloria"); Jeff Buckley ("The Way Young Lovers Do", [...] "Sweet Thing"); Nick Drake; and numerous others, including the Counting Crows (their [...] "sha-la-la" [...] sequence in Mr Jones, is a tribute to Morrison). Morrison's influence reaches into the country music genre, with Hal Ketchum acknowledging, [...] "He (Van Morrison) was a major influence in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{started in}} 1979 when I was racing in Denmark {{actually}} for a sex magazine called Rapport. They offered me 1,000 kroner if I would sing [...] "My Way". I had {{the words on}} a piece of paper but started two chords higher than I should have, and when the notes got too high, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> I started again, got through it, and it's gone on from there. The rate varies. I get 2,000 deutschmarks for one song in Munich. When I started doing it regularly in about 1980, I would get 500 a night, and sometimes I'd sing on four nights.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} because I knew that, emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{shall have}} them," [...] Guy {{said as he}} placed them in his doublet, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> till midnight <b>to</b> get speech with them; the matter of waiting a few hours is but a trifle in {{comparison}} with the life of a man.

6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] Edgar exclaimed; [...] "there they are. I mean to {{see this}} battle, Sidi, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> here a month. It cannot be long before Nelson arrives. I cannot think why the French admiral should have risked being caught in a trap like this, when a defeat would cut the French army off from Europe altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} kept me in as a {{punishment}} because I did my sums wrong.

60|$|The Boy was black-haired, {{and so was}} the Major, luckily. I cut off a {{piece of}} the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making.

60|$|To detail {{just the}} {{opposite}} of the above invoice is to describe me. I haven't any right to criticise books, and I don't do it except when I hate them. I often want to criticise Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> every time <b>I</b> begin.|$|R
5000|$|Wilkinson {{has spoken}} {{of her love}} {{for the work of}} Diana Wynne Jones, David Almond and Lewis Carroll in interviews.

6000|$|I don't {{know why}} their {{interest}} should have prompted {{me to go}} on and paint the lily a little, but I certainly did so. I did not stop till the music began again, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> By the time the piece was finished I had begun to have my misgivings, and I profited by the brief interval of silence to say to the young girl, [...] "I wouldn't have you think we are a whirl of gaiety exactly." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} {{reasons why we}} {{could not find a}} lock fit to send. The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily.

60|$|I {{threw up}} my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, {{and set off}} in vast leaps towards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and twisted my ankle, and after that I {{stumbled}} at almost every leap. I {{was in a state}} of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite breathless long before I got to it. Three times at least <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> with my hands resting on my side and in spite of the thin dryness of the air, the perspiration was wet upon my face.|$|E
60|$|Up I got, {{was welcomed}} almost {{instantly}} by another cloud of spray, {{but this time}} stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA.

6000|$|... ‘When I was in Suffolk,’ resumed Mr. Parsons, with an {{impatient}} {{glance at his}} wife, who pretended not to observe it, ‘which is now years ago, business {{led me to the}} town of Bury St. Edmund’s. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> at the principal places in my way, and therefore, for the sake of convenience, I travelled in a gig.

30|$|Further {{reflection}} on the domain of practice also occurred, since the new instructional style was one she was uncomfortable with. She stated in the informal interview “It’s hard for me…so <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> I’m on a roll and I’m teaching these concepts, and then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and let them break up into groups.

60|$|It was blazing hot up the valley, windless, with vehement sun upon my shoulders; and I had to labour so {{consistently}} with my stick {{that the}} sweat ran into my eyes.
