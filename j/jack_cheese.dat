5000|$|Dale (voiced by Corey Burton) is the {{co-founder of}} the Rescue Rangers. He wears a red and yellow Hawaiian shirt {{reminiscent}} of Thomas Magnum in Magnum, P.I.

500|$|Returning to the {{practice}} of targeting the adult demographic as it had in 1978, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003.

The sandwich was part of then-CEO Greg Brenneman's plans to bolster the company's revived [...] "Have it your way" [...] advertising program, which was designed to draw younger people to its stores. Some items, including the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats, and the presence of trans-fats. At the time, many of the products featured higher-quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, Cheddar cheese, and pepper <b>jack</b> <b>cheese.</b> Not all the products new products introduced under Blum's tenure met corporate sales expectations, the Baguette Chicken sandwiches being an example. Others products, such as Burger King's line of [...] "indulgent" [...] burgers originally called the Angus Burger, have undergone multiple reformulations. The Angus Steak burger was originally based around a [...] frozen patty; despite high expectations from the company, the sandwich fared poorly. After a reformulating program, it was relaunched in 2008 as the [...] Angus Steakhouse burger. With the introduction of a new multifunction broiler capable of cooking a more diverse set of products, Burger King replaced the Angus Steakhouse burger with the [...] Steakhouse XT burger in 2009. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice Burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1.
