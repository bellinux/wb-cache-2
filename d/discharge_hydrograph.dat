5000|$|The {{catchment}} {{of a river}} above {{a certain}} location {{is determined by the}} surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream's <b>discharge</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event. The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession. Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies. Analysis of the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration and the response of the stream discharge are aided by the concept of the unit hydrograph, which represents the response of stream discharge over time to the application of a hypothetical [...] "unit" [...] amount and duration of rainfall (e.g., half an inch over one hour). The amount of precipitation correlates to the volume of water (depending on the area of the catchment) that subsequently flows out of the river. Using the unit hydrograph method, actual historical rainfalls can be modeled mathematically to confirm characteristics of historical floods, and hypothetical [...] "design storms" [...] can be created for comparison to observed stream responses.|$|E

40|$|One {{stumbling}} block in water resources engineering is {{the inadequacy of}} stream flow records. Records available from many streams are of insufficient length for use in design and prediction, and for some streams no streamflow data have been recorded. Risk-based methods may require large sets of possible stream flow scenarios. The goal {{of this study is}} to develop a method to extend gage records realistically, and allow synthesis of realistic daily <b>discharge</b> <b>hydrographs.</b> The original purpose of the study was to provide long duration (100 -year) daily <b>discharge</b> <b>hydrographs</b> for a mathematical model that predicts bridge pier scour. A Markov model with time-varying parameters is developed and implemented in Matlab. The model captures the annual cycle and day-to-day persistence of daily streamflow, using 10 parameters estimated from gage records, without precipitation input or watershed modeling. The Matlab program reads text files of stream flow records, estimates the model parameters, and saves results in spreadsheet format. Seventy-eight stream gages in Maryland, with drainage areas from 2 to 27000, are analyzed. Several examples demonstrate the use of the model in synthesis mode.

40|$|Climate impact studies {{regarding}} floods usually {{focus on}} peak discharges and a bivariate assessment of peak <b>discharges</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> volumes is not commonly included. A joint consideration of peak <b>discharges</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> volumes, however, is crucial when assessing flood risks for {{current and future}} climate conditions. Here, we present a methodology to develop synthetic design hydrographs for future climate conditions that jointly consider peak <b>discharges</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> volumes. First, change factors are derived based on a regional climate model and are applied to observed precipitation and temperature time series. Second, the modified time series are fed into a calibrated hydrological model to simulate runoff time series for future conditions. Third, these time series are used to construct synthetic design hydrographs. The bivariate flood frequency analysis used {{in the construction of}} synthetic design hydrographs takes into account the dependence between peak <b>discharges</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> volumes, and represents the shape of the hydrograph. The latter is modeled using a probability density function while the dependence between the design variables peak <b>discharge</b> and <b>hydrograph</b> volume is modeled using a copula. We applied this approach to a set of eight mountainous catchments in Switzerland to construct catchment-specific and season-specific design hydrographs for a control and three scenario climates. Our work demonstrates that projected climate changes have an impact not only on peak discharges but also on hydrograph volumes and on hydrograph shapes both at an annual and at a seasonal scale. These changes are not necessarily proportional which implies that climate impact assessments on future floods should consider more flood characteristics than just flood peaks...|$|R

In the routing problems, The Saint Venant equations are solved to get the discharge and water level in the future time series.

The proposed methodology solves the Saint-Venant equations in diffusive form also involving the lateral contribution using an ‘head driven’ modeling approach where lateral inflow {{is assumed to be}} function of the water level at the tributary junction. The procedure allows to assess the <b>discharge</b> <b>hydrograph</b> at ends of a selected river reach with significant lateral inflow, starting from the stage recorded there and without needing rainfall data. Specifically, the MAST 1 D hydraulic model is applied to solve the diffusive wave equation using the observed stage hydrograph at the upstream section as upstream boundary condition. The other required data are: 1) the observed stage hydrograph at the downstream section, as benchmark for the parameter calibration, 2) the bathymetry of the river reach, from the upstream section to a short distance after the downstream gauged section. The method is validated with different flood events observed in two river reaches with a significant intermediate basin, where reliable rating curves were available, selected along the Tiber River, in central Italy, and the Alzette River, in Luxembourg. Very good performance indices are found for the computed discharge hydrographs at both the channel ends and along the tributaries. The mean Nash Sutcliffe value (NSq) at the channel ends of two rivers is found equal to 0. 99 and 0. 86 for the upstream and downstream sites, respectively.

The modelling framework was applied to two study sites in the floodplains of the Austrian Danube River, East of Vienna. Validation of modelled flood events showed good agreement with gauge readings. Together with measured sediment properties, results of the validated connectivity model were used as basis for a predictive model yielding patterns of potential microbial respiration based on the best fit between characteristics of a number of sampling sites and the corresponding modelled parameters. Hot spots of potential microbial respiration were found in areas of lower connectivity if connected during higher discharges and areas of high water depths...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReduction of {{vegetative}} cover by forest harvesting generally increases the average surface runoff volume and peak discharge {{for a given}} area of land. Forest harvesting in tropical Indonesian rainforest is managed using a selective logging system. The {{purpose of this study}} is to find the effect of controlled selective logging technique to reduce the hydrological effect on runoff. This study was conducted in three paired small headwater catchments in natural tropical rainforest area of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Catchment A was an undisturbed catchment for control. Catchment B and C were treated with reduce impact logging technique in selective logging activities. Controlled selective logging activities in the catchment B and C reduced canopy cover to 30 % of natural cover. <b>Discharging</b> <b>hydrograph</b> response in the logged catchment produced higher peak discharge as consequences of high surface runoff. The runoff hydrograph parameter in the three catchments showed similar response to rainfall event, and the highest response of peak discharge was in the catchment B which had largest opened area. The average of direct runoff ratio in the catchment A, B and C were 31. 35 %; 46. 12 % and 44. 83 %, respectively. Implementation of reduce impact logging technique was effective to control the impact of logging on the runoff responses...|$|R
