When 610 imol of iron (34 mg) was added to a turkey test meal containing 61 mol of zinc (4 mg), 6 tZn absorption was not inhibited. Tin, 306 imol (36 mg), given with zinc chloride or turkey test meals (61 mol, 4 mg, of Zn) significantly reduced 65 Zn absorption. Copper, 79 pmol (5 mg), had no {{significant effect on the}} 65 Zn absorption from 7. 9 gmol (0. 5 mg) of zinc chloride. In summary, the capacity to absorb iron did not influence 65 Zn absorption, but both <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> and heme-iron inhibited 65 Zn absorption from zinc chloride. <b>Inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> had no effect, however, on 6 tZn absorption from the turkey test meal.

40|$|Purpose: The body {{concentration}} of iron is regulated by a fine equilibrium between absorption and losses of iron. Iron can be absorbed from diet as <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> or as heme. Hemopexin is an acute phase protein that limits iron access to microorganisms. Moreover, {{it is the}} plasma protein with the highest binding affinity for heme and thus it mediates heme-iron recycling. Considering its involvement in iron homeostasis, it was postulated that hemopexin {{may play a role}} in the physiological absorption of <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron.</b> Methods and Results: Hemopexin-null mice showed elevated iron deposits in enterocytes, associated with higher duodenal H-Ferritin levels and a significant increase in duodenal expression and activity of heme oxygenase. The expression of heme-iron and <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> transporters was normal. The rate of iron absorption was assessed by measuring the amount of 57 Fe retained in tissues from hemopexin-null and wild-type animals after administration of an oral dose of 57 FeSO 4 or of 57 Fe-labelled heme. Higher iron retention in the duodenum of hemopexin-null mice was observed as compared with normal mice. Conversely, iron transfer from enterocytes to liver and bone marrow was unaffected in hemopexin-null mice. Conclusions: The increased iron level in hemopexin-null duodenum can be accounted for by an increased iron uptake by enterocytes and storage in ferritins. These data indicate that the lack of hemopexin under physiological conditions leads to an enhanced duodenal iron uptake thus providing new insights to our understanding of body iron homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|A {{reaction}} of N-bromosuccinimide with the heme groups of hemoglobin {{has been studied}} spectrophotometrically.

40|$|The uptake of {{anthropogenic}} atmospheric CO 2 by {{the oceans}} causes {{a shift in}} the carbonate chemistry system which includes a lowering of pH; this process has been termed ocean acidification. Our understanding of the specific effects of ocean acidification on chemical speciation of trace metals, in particular on organic-metal interactions, is limited. In this study we have experimentally determined the effects of changing pH from 8. 3 to 6. 8 (on the NBS scale) on the speciation of iron and copper in estuarine waters. Our experimental results indicated that complexation of iron and copper would decrease and <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> and copper concentrations increase, as pH decreased, although {{it was not possible to}} confidently quantify changes in speciation at lower pH due to constraints of the analytical technique. In addition to our experimental approach, we used a non-ideal competitive adsorption (NICA) - Donnan model to determine the chemical speciation of iron and copper as a function of pH. The NICA-Donnan model was optimised in order to produce similar metal binding characteristics to those observed in our sample across the pH range examined in our study. The model allowed for simultaneous modelling of solubility and organic complexation. Model results indicated that a decrease in iron and copper binding by organic matter at lower pH, coupled with increased solubility (for iron), resulted in a 3 fold increase in <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> concentration and a 6 fold increase in inorganic copper concentration at pH of 7. 41 compared to a pH of 8. 18 (expressed on the total scale).

Variability in DOC might thus be expected to have a greater impact on metal speciation in seawater, than projected variability in pH resulting from increases in atmospheric CO 2. Our study therefore suggests that increases in the concentrations of the more bioavailable <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> and copper species in estuarine waters resulting from increased pCO 2 are likely to occur, but that such changes will be moderate in magnitude...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES Iron is an {{important}} mineral, essential for the health and function of mammalian cells. Despite its key role, iron deficiency in humans is common worldwide, often leading to significant health issues within the population. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential of using iron-enriched baker's yeast as a source of iron, especially for the protection and recovery from conditions related to anemia. METHODS Iron-enriched yeast was prepared by cultivating cells on basal medium comprising different iron concentrations. The effects of iron supplementation on animal health were assessed by feeding anemic rats with a variety of diets containing either <b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> or iron-enriched yeast. Body weight, iron bioavailability, blood parameters, and the activity of iron-containing enzymes (catalase) were studied. RESULTS Iron accumulation in yeast cells increased with iron concentration, reaching a maximum of 15 mg/g when 32 mM iron was applied. Rat groups fed iron-enriched yeast had the highest feed efficiency, iron bioavailability, and hemoglobin concentration. The source of iron supplementation influenced catalase activity in kidney tissues, increasing from 70 U/g tissue in anemic rats to 90 U/g tissue (<b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> salt), 110 U/g tissue (<b>inorganic</b> <b>iron</b> salt and non-enriched dry yeast), 145 U/g tissue (iron-enriched yeast 15 mg/g iron) and 115 U/g tissue (iron-enriched yeast 30 mg/g iron). The histologic study of tissues from liver, kidney, heart, and spleen of rats from different groups showed that the damage observed in tissues of anemic rats, was not observed after feeding with iron-enriched yeasts.

40|$|Although {{advances}} in water treatment technology {{have contributed to}} improved water quality at water treatment plants, treated water is not reaching consumer taps with the same quality. Water quality in service pipes is lower than at the water treatment plants, most likely because rust corrosion particles are generated inside the pipes, accumulated sediments become resuspended or other reasons. In this study, particles suspended in treated water flowing through water mains of various service areas were collected, and their quantity and elemental compositions were analyzed to investigate changes in suspended solid (SS) characteristics over distance and time. In addition to longitudinal changes along water mains, cross-sectional SS changes were investigated by developing a method of directly collecting SS particles flowing through a water main at different vertical locations. SS concentrations and the percentages of <b>inorganics</b> and <b>iron</b> in SS increased as water traveled toward the dead end of a main. Vertical differences of SS in the main cross section were also observed: SS concentrations in the upper part were higher {{than those in the}} middle and lower parts. The higher percentages of <b>inorganics</b> and <b>iron</b> in the upper part suggested that scaling in {{the upper part of the}} main, which had a stagnant area, caused iron particles to be released into the stream. Temporal variations in SS concentrations were observed for water flowing through the middle and lower parts of the main cross section. SS concentrations increased with increased flow rates, indicating resuspension of sediment at the bottoms of the mains. Overall, SS concentrations, their temporal variations, their cross-sectional changes and the elemental compositions of SS in water were different in various water service areas, and these characteristics could be useful in determining the origin of SS particles in drinking water...|$|R

Long-term flow reactor studies were performed in the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory to investigate the development of microbial mats dominated by iron-oxidizing bacteria, namely Mariprofundus sp. and Gallionella sp. The experiments investigated the accumulation and fractionation of TREE under controlled conditions and enabled us to assess potential biosignatures evolving within the microbial iron oxyhydroxides.
