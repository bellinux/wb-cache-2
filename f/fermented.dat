5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed <b>fermented</b> residue left behind by the alcoholic beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the <b>fermented</b> drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, <b>fermented</b> beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

During the storage of yoghurt the number of lactose <b>fermenting</b> yeast species (Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus and Candida kefyr) increased by 3 times, and non-lactose <b>fermenting</b> yeast species (Debaryomyces hansenii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), by 7 – 9 times.
