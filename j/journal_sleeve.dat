40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the application of}} a linear-quadratic regulator to a controllable tilting-pad bearing system to reduce the vibration in a rotating machine. This application first requires a nonlinear transient simulation of the bearing to determine the stiffness and damping coefficients associated with each pad of the bearing at a given equilibrium position. The stiffness and damping coefficients are incorporated into a linear state-variable model, and a state-feedback control law is computed to minimize a quadratic performance index. The performance index parameters are adjusted to produce a suitably regulated shaft orbit in the nonlinear simulation. The results stand as a significant step toward the application of feedback control to an experimental bearing system. 1. Introduction In all rotating equipment the shaft is primarily supported by bearings that allow it to rotate smoothly with little friction.

40|$|This paper shows a {{theoretical}} vibration analysis regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft <b>journals</b> in <b>sleeve</b> bearings of electrical motors, {{based on a}} simplified rotordynamic model. It is shown that elliptical shaft journals lead to kinematic constraints regarding {{the movement of the}} shaft journals on the oil film of the sleeve bearings and therefore to an excitation of the rotordynamic system. The solution of the linear differential equation system leads to the mathematical description of the movement of the rotor mass, the shaft <b>journals,</b> and the <b>sleeve</b> bearing housings. Additionally the relative movements between the shaft journals and the bearing housings are deduced, as well as the bearing housing vibration velocities. The presented simplified rotordynamic model can also be applied to rotating machines, other than electrical machines. In this case, only the electromagnetic spring value cm has to be put to zero...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the known {{phenomenon}} which takes place at rotor-stator contact. It is backward precession (whirl) of unbalanced shaft inside rigidly constrained <b>sleeves</b> (<b>journal</b> bearings) in the range below its critical speed. The purpose of this theoretical work is to research dynamic behavior of unbalanced shaft at the elastically constrained sleeves and above-resonant range...|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{was attributed to}} the disengagement of {{the left and right}} spur gear teeth in the main transmission, caused by the load imposed by the failure of the gearbox's rear <b>sleeve</b> bearing <b>journals.</b> The rear <b>sleeve</b> bearing failure was caused by an oil leak although evidence was destroyed by fire and the source of the leak was not established.|$|R
40|$|Vibration of a statically loaded, {{inherently}} compensated {{hydrostatic journal}} bearing due to oscillating exhaust pressure is investigated. Both angular and radial vibration modes are analyzed. The time-dependent Reynolds equation governing the pressure distribution between the oscillating <b>journal</b> and <b>sleeve</b> is solved {{together with the}} journal equation of motion to obtain the response characteristics of the bearing. The Reynolds equation and the equation of motion are simplified by applying regular perturbation theory for small displacements. The numerical solutions of the perturbation equations are obtained by discretizing the pressure field using finite-difference aproximations with a discrete, nonuniform line-source model which excludes effects due to feeding hole volume. An iterative scheme is used to simultaneously satisfy the equations of motion for the journal. The results presented include Bode plots of bearing-oscillation gain and phase for a particular bearing configuration for various combinations of parameters over a range of frequencies, including the resonant frequency...|$|R
40|$|Offset journal {{bearings}} are an attractive design option for cross-head and piston bearings for two-stroke engines. Two-stroke engine design {{has seen a}} resurgence {{in the last few}} years due to potential gains in engine efficiency over their four-stroke counterparts. The cross-head and piston bearings comprising such engines, however, are characterized by non-reversing loads with limited oscillating journal motion, the combination of which provides poor bearing performance for conventional cylindrical bearings. The division of bearing <b>journal</b> and <b>sleeve</b> into offset segments allows for periodic load relaxation in the segments and development of squeeze-film action which substantially improves bearing performance. Offset bearings have been in production for the past 60 years, but there are no general design guidelines available to the engine analyst. This thesis provides predictions of the primary bearing performance factors, cyclic-minimum film thickness and cyclic-maximum film pressure, over a wide range of design parameters found in production-level, two-stroke engines...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a mathematical rotordynamic model regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft <b>journals</b> in <b>sleeve</b> bearings of electrical motors also considering the gyroscopic effect. For {{this kind of}} excitation, a mathematical rotordynamic model was developed considering {{the influence of the}} oil film stiffness and damping of the sleeve bearings, the stiffness of the end-shields and bearing housings, the stiffness of the rotor, the electromagnetic stiffness in the air gap of the electrical motor and the mass moment of inertia of the rotor and therefore also considering the gyroscopic effect. The solution of the linear differential equation system leads to the mathematical description of the absolute orbits of the shaft centre, the shaft journals and the bearing housings and to the relative orbits between the shaft journals and the bearing housings. Additionally, the bearing housing velocities can also be derived with this mathematical rotordynamic model. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing <b>journal.</b> Surrounding the <b>Sleeve</b> is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|R
40|$|Journal {{bearings}} are {{a fundamental}} component in many pieces of machinery. A properly designed bearing {{is capable of}} supporting large loads in rotating systems with minimal frictional energy losses and virtually no wear even after years of services. These benefits make an understanding of dynamic behavior of these devices very valuable. In applications where journal bearings are subject to misalignment (conditions where the <b>journal</b> and <b>sleeve</b> axes are not parallel), {{it has long been}} understood that bearing performance can be compromised. To eliminate this problem, self-aligning bearings have been designed. The sleeves of these bearings are capable of moving freely to accommodate misalignment. The aligning motion of these bearings under dynamic loading is, however, largely unexplored. Additionally, the impact of misalignment on journal midplane motion is unknown. Currently, finite element and finite difference analyses are the only available tools for this kind of work. This requires a unique and computationally costly mathematical solution for every possible bearing configuration. It is the goal of this thesis to develop a computationally efficient means of predicting journal motion within a self-aligning bearing. This is done by creating a set of 2 ̆ 2 mobility 2 ̆ 2 mapping functions from finite element bearing models that relate the velocity of the journal to the applied load. Such maps have previously been built and used successfully for the design of perfectly aligned bearings. This expansion of the mobility method to self-aligning bearings provides a valuable tool for the designer and gives valuable insight into the journal motion for these devices...|$|R
