5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper air plots at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E

5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E

5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2010, Van der Sloot {{reportedly}} {{confessed to}} killing Flores, {{after hours of}} interrogation. He initially proclaimed his innocence. According to an expert in Peruvian law, the confession <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> defense strategy {{of trying to get}} the charge reduced to manslaughter, which is punishable by 6 to 20 years in prison, while a conviction for murder could result in up to 35 years' imprisonment. The prosecution was seeking a sentence of 30 years. Peru does not issue life sentences in standard cases of murder and has abolished capital punishment in all but exceptional circumstances, such as crimes committed under military law. A life sentence can be issued for a murder committed during the commission of a robbery. Peruvian president Alan García Pérez used the case to seek the reinstatement of the death penalty for murder.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} {{formation}} lap, Heinz-Harald Frentzen stalled his Sauber whilst attempting {{to leave the}} grid {{and was forced to}} start from the pitlane. The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill {{to the back of the}} field and was forced to make a pitstop in order to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> new nose cone. Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.|$|E

5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and <b>fit,</b> <b>a</b> Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E
5|$|White Star then {{ordered a}} new 212-foot bow section from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, which was {{launched}} head-first in October 1907. It was popularly {{said at the}} time that Suevic was the longest ship in the world, with her bow in Belfast and her stern in Southampton. The new bow was then towed to the shipyard of J.I. Thornycroft in Southampton, where it arrived on 26 October. By mid-November it was in position and being joined {{to the rest of the}} ship. The bow was a good <b>fit,</b> <b>a</b> testimony to the craftsmanship of the Harland and Wolff shipwrights. Ten months later, after the largest ship rebuilding effort ever undertaken at the time, on 14 January 1908, Suevic was completed and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E

5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> chosen Persona family.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th {{century the}} native Welsh princes built {{a number of}} stone castles. The size of these varied {{considerably}} from smaller fortifications, such as Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, to more substantial castles like Deganwy Castle and the largest, Castell y Bere. Native Welsh castles typically maximised the defensive benefits of high, mountainous sites, often being built in an irregular shape to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> rocky peak. Most had deep ditches {{cut out of the}} rock to protect the main castle. The Welsh castles were usually built with a relatively short keep, used as living accommodation for princes and nobility, and with distinctive rectangular watch-towers along the walls. In comparison to Norman castles the gatehouses were much weaker in design, with almost no use of portcullises or spiral staircases, and the stonework of the outer walls was also generally inferior to Norman built castles. The very last native Welsh castles, built in the 1260s, more closely resemble Norman designs; in the case of Dinas Brân including a round keep and Norman gatehouse defences.|$|E
5|$|Following the Canadian Grand Prix on 18 June, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours between 21–23 June {{to prepare for}} the upcoming French Grand Prix. Coulthard set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen lost control of his car after suffering a mechanical problem and crashed into the barriers at turn two. Verstappen sustained neck strain and withdrew from testing. He was later passed fit to compete in the Grand Prix. Coulthard remained fastest on the second day. Fisichella damaged the underside of his car's chassis, limiting his testing time as Benetton made repairs to his car. Häkkinen was quickest {{on the final day of}} testing. Michael Schumacher stopped on circuit as his Ferrari engine failed, causing his team to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> new engine into the chassis. Ferrari went to their private testing facility, the Fiorano Circuit, on 27 June where test driver Luca Badoer shook down three Ferrari F1-2000 cars and also took part in pit stop practices.|$|E
30|$|Figure 6 (4) is {{an example}} which {{includes}} a line segment as outlier points. All methods <b>fitted</b> <b>an</b> almost correct ellipse. In Fig. 6 (4), since Yu’s method <b>fitted</b> <b>an</b> ellipse to a short arc, {{the accuracy of the}} resulting ellipse is not good compared with the other methods. Figure 6 (5) {{is an example}} where an outlier arc is smoothly connected to an inlier arc. For such input data, outlier detection based on the curvature of a point sequence may not work well. However, our method can correctly detect inlier and outlier arcs because it iteratively selects inlier arcs and <b>fits</b> <b>an</b> ellipse. In Fig. 6 (6), (7), input point sequences consist of elliptic arcs and contours of other shapes. Our method and RANSAC <b>fitted</b> <b>a</b> correct ellipse for each data. However, Yu’s method <b>fitted</b> <b>a</b> small ellipse to a short arc for Fig. 6 (7). Shao’s method detected many outlier points. The inlier selection process of our method for Fig. 6 (7) is shown in Fig. 5. The input data of Fig 6 (8) includes many outlier points. Our method and Yu’s method output an almost correct ellipse. Since the ratio of outliers was large, RANSAC did not work well.|$|R

5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed {{into the side of}} Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to <b>fit</b> <b>a</b> spare wheel nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E
