25|$|Most {{techniques}} {{used to study}} protein–protein interactions rely on in vitro methods. Unfortunately, studying proteins in an artificial system, outside of their cellular environment, poses a number of difficulties. For example, this may require the removal of proteins from their normal cellular environment. The processing required to isolate the protein may affect its interactions with other proteins. In addition, isolating the protein from the intracellular signaling and mechanisms {{that occur in the}} normal cell may provide a misleading picture of intracellular and physiological occurrences. Furthermore, proteins studied in vitro may be studied at concentrations vastly different from their normal abundance levels, may not necessarily be transported efficiently into the cells, or may not be selective enough to function in the host genome. Finally, by studying proteins in vitro, one is unable to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of specific protein–protein interactions in the cell on the functional or physiological consequences.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Nielsen Online {{reported}} that Twitter had a user-retention rate of forty percent. Many people stop using the service after a month; therefore the site may potentially reach only about {{ten percent of}} all Internet users. In 2009, Twitter won the [...] "Breakout of the Year" [...] Webby Award. During a February 2009 discussion on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition, the journalist Daniel Schorr stated that Twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact-checking and other editorial improvements. In response, Andy Carvin gave Schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on Twitter and said users wanted first-hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories. On November 29, 2009 Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it [...] "a new form of social interaction". Time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its 2010 Time 100; to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of people, it used a formula based on famous social networking sites, Twitter and Facebook. The list ranges from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey to Lady Gaga and Ashton Kutcher. The U.S. government, seeing social media's role in the 2010 Arab Spring revolts, covertly developed a Cuban alternative to Twitter called ZunZuneo {{as part of a}} long-term strategy to [...] "stir unrest". The service was active from 2010 to 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Combination of {{structural}} elements of ACh and nicotine {{as well as}} reducing the conformational flexibility by using a cyclopropane ring {{has led to the}} discovery of potent and selective α4β2 nAChR ligands. The modulation of three structural elements, the linker, substitution on the amino group and the pyridine ring can be used to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> on potency and selectivity of the ligands. Factors that decrease the binding are steric hindrance on the amino group and linkers that are saturated/unsaturated carbon chains. Short-chained ether linkers are preferred. [...] Beneficial effects on the binding is seen with substitution on the pyridine ring both mono- and disubstitution with halogens among other groups. Substitution on the amino group with three different amides increased the binding affinity where methylamide had the highest binding. Lower binding in the other substituted amides was explained by steric hindrance or lack of a methyl group resulting in loss of hydrophobic interaction. Stereochemistry of pyridine nitrogen and/or the pyridine ring and its stereoelectronic effects has a subtle beneficial effect on the binding to the α4β2 nAChR. Thus it was shown that a pyridyl ether ligand with bromo substitution on the pyridine and metylatedamide on the amino group had the highest potency.|$|E
