40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the appropriate elasticity of the textile material used for making women's girdle. Background: The elastic textiles have been used for making girdle. The hard type girdle gave high pressure on the body to make slim look. However, excessively high garment pressure caused negative effect to human bodies. This study studied the material giving proper garment pressure in girdle. Method: In this study five experimental girdles were made fabrics with various elasticities. The change of garment pressures and body girths were measured after subjects wearing the experimental girdles. The garment pressure was measured at 10 points. Body girths measured at abdomen, hip, and thigh. Results: The garment pressure of the commercial girdle was high at side of waistband, side femur and back gluteal fold. The experimental girdles made with high elasticity material definitely lowered garment pressure at those points. After wearing experimental girdle their abdomen and <b>hip</b> <b>girths</b> measurements were decreased. But, thigh girth was not reduced. Conclusion: The girdle made with excellent elasticity materials reduced garment pressure significantly and it made body slim as much as the commercial girdle except the thighs. Application: This study provides guideline for the developin...|$|R
40|$|Physical fitness, {{participation}} in physical activity, fundamental motor skills and body composition are important {{contributors to the}} health {{and the development of a}} healthy lifestyle among children and youth. The New South Wales Schools Fitness and Physical Activity Survey, 1997, was conducted to fill some of the gaps in our knowledge of these aspects of the lives of young people in New South Wales. The survey was conducted in February and March, 1997 and collected data on a randomly-selected sample of students (n = 5518) in Years 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Measures were taken on body composition (height and weight, waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> skinfolds), health-related fitness (aerobic capacity, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility), fundamental motor skills (run, vertical jump, catch, overhand throw, forehand strike and kick), self-reported physical activity, time spent in sedentary recreation, and physical education (PE) classes. The methods are described to assist in the development of surveys of other populations and to provoke debate relevant to the development and dissemination of standard approaches to monitoring the fitness, physical activity habits and body composition of Australian children and youth. Finally, we offer comments on some of the strengths and limitations of the methods employed...|$|R

The current study examined the effects of regular exercise on body composition and cardio-respiratory function of ex-servicemen who served in varying theatres of conflict. One hundred and twenty three Australian ex-servicemen (mean age 54. 2, range 28 - 77 yrs; height 1. 75 0. 63 m; mass 95. 80 1. 67 kg) currently residing in the tropics (North Queensland region) volunteered for this study. All participants received medical clearance from their general practitioner prior to undertaking a 6 -month regular exercise programme. Cardio-respiratory and anthropometry measurements were obtained prior to and following the exercise programme. The exercise programme consisted of combined aerobic and resistance training of at least 45 minutes duration, 1 to 2 days per week. Approximately 84 % of the participants completed the programme with 73. 2 % undertaking 1 - 2 sessions per week while 26. 8 % completed more than 2 sessions per week. Paired t-test analysis indicated significant (p< 0. 05) changes in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, all skinfold measurements, waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> exercise heart rates and VO 2 max.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{morphological}} characteristics and physical strength of the Malaysian cricket batsmen. Methods: Twenty four top order batsmen from the Malaysian senior, under- 19 s and under- 16 s cricket team were recruited for the study. Twenty six anthropometric, four somatotype and two physical strength variables were measured from all participants. Stature were measured by using stadiometer, calipers for skin-fold, non-stretch tape for girth, sliding caliper for segmental lengths and circumferences (breadths) and dynamometers for hand grip and back strength. Cater and heath (1990) equation was used to find the somatotype variables of height-weight ratio, endomorph, mesomorph and ectomorph. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyses significant between group differences in the variables. Results: The senior batsmen were significantly higher than under- 19 s and under- 16 s in body mass, relax and flex arm girths, forearm girth, chest girth, waist girth, calf girth, bi-acromial breadth, transvers breadth and hand grip strength. Both senior and under- 19 s batsmen were significantly higher than under- 16 s batsmen in arm span, total arm length, humerus and femur breadths. The under- 16 s batsmen were also significantly lesser than senior in <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> hand lengths and bi-ilocrist breadth, and from under- 19 s in sitting height and total leg length. Conclusion: Senior batsmen were significantly higher in the anthropometric measurement of girths, breadth and lengths than U- 16 because of 10 years age difference.

40|$|Our aim was {{to examine}} whether a new ratio, waist divided by height 0. 5 (WHT. 5 R), is both {{independent}} of stature and a stronger predictor of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) than other anthropometric indices. Subjects (4117 males and 646 females), aged 20 - 69 years, were assessed for stature (cm), mass (kg), waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths</b> (cm) from which, body mass index (BMI), Waist to Hip ratio (WHR), Waist to Height ratio (WHTR) and two new indices, a body shape index (ABSI) and WHT. 5 R were determined. We used the allometric power law, W=a. HTb, to obtain a simple body-shape index for waist girth (W) to be independent of stature (HT). Physical activity was determined using self-report and physical fitness was determined using the Bruce protocol. Glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and TC/HDL ratio were determined from fasting venous blood samples. A single CMR composite score was derived from log transformed z-scores of: Triglycerides + average blood pressure ((diastolic + systolic) / 2) + glucose + HDL (*- 1). Results confirmed WHT. 5 R to be independent of stature and the strongest predictor of CMR, compared to BMI, WC, WHR, ABSI and WHTR. We also found that CMR scores decline significantly with increasing fitness and physical activity, confirming that being fit and active can compensate for the adverse effects of being fat as measured by all other anthropometric indices. In conclusion, WHT. 5 R was the best anthropometric index associated with CMR, and being both physically fit and active has a protective effect on CMR, irrespective of weight status...|$|R

40|$|Background: Whether {{abdominal}} {{obesity is}} related to coronary artery calcification (CAC) is not known. Objective: We investigated the relations of waist girth and waist-hip ratio (WHR) to CAC in 2951 African American and white young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Design: The present study was a cross-sectional and observational cohort study. Using standardized protocols, we measured CAC in 2001 – 2002 by using computed tomography and measured waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths</b> in 1985 – 1986 (baseline), 1995 – 1996 (year 10), and 2001 – 2002 (year 15, waist girth only). CAC was classified as present or absent, whereas waist girth and WHR were placed in sex-specific tertiles. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, race, clinical center, physical activity, cigarette smoking, education, and alcohol intake, baseline waist girth and WHR were directly associated with a higher preva-lence of CAC 15 y later (P for trend 0. 001 for both). The odds ratios (ORs) for CAC in the highest versus lowest tertiles of waist girth and WHR were 1. 9 (95 % CI: 1. 36, 2. 65) and 1. 7 (1. 23, 2. 41), respectively. Waist girth and WHR at year 10 and waist girth at year 15 similarly predicted CAC. These associations persisted after ad-ditional adjustment for systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin con-centrations, diabetes, and antihypertensive medication use but be-came nonsignificant after additional adjustment for blood lipids. Conclusions: Abdominal obesity measured by waist girth or WHR is associated with early atherosclerosis {{as measured by the}} presence of CAC in African American and white young adults. This is con-sistent with an involvement of visceral fat in the occurrence of coronary artery calcium in young adults. Am J Clin Nutr 2007...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether the tendencies and scope of changes in body mass, body composition and body girths across the menstrual cycle were similar or different in women of different body build. Anthropometric examinations were carried out in a group of 40 naturally regularly menstruated females practicing team sports (aged 19 - 21, B-v 169. 3 +/- 6. 4 cm, body mass 59. 6 +/- 7. 0 kg), in the follicular, periovulatory and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The phases were determined on the basis of data from two consecutive menstrual cycles taking into account the cycle’s length. To establish the type of body build, Body Mass Index, hydration status and skinfold thickness were measured. For a statistical analysis, a multiple comparisons with multiple confidence intervals were applied. The increase in body mass between the follicular and the luteal phases was observed in all groups of women, the biggest gain was recorded in slim women, who in the luteal phase weighted 0. 8 kg more. The amount of fat mass increased significantly across the menstrual cycle only in more hydrated (by about 0. 66 kg) and slim women (by about 0. 54 kg). Significant changes between consecutive phases of the menstrual cycle in waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> and suprailiac skinfold thickness in some groups of women also indicate influence of fatness and hydration status and slenderness. In view of the presented results, the body build seems important for an analysis of the pattern of each component’s changes across the menstrual cycle, especially for female athletes.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Over {{the past}} hundred years, the {{emphasis}} of the contemporary ideal body image for women has become a picture of extreme thinness. This thin image inflated the minds of young women {{to such an extent}} that it has become a great area of concern for both psychologists and health care providers. The first aim of the study was to identify the anthropometrical trends of first year female students, as well as to determine their body composition- related health risk. The second aim was to compare their anthropometric profiles to their degree of body image distortion (Body Dissatisfaction and Drive for Thinness). The mean age of the women was 18. 9 years. Their mean stature (165. 0 cm) compared well with the U. S. norms for stature, whereas their mean body mass (62. 4 kg) tested slightly higher than the U. S. norms for body mass for women aged 16 to 20 years. Regarding the waist- and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> the group tested shapely for a medium U. S. trouser size. The majority of subjects fell in the low risk category for the BMI (18. 5 - 24 - 91, whereas their body fat percentages revealed average health risk. The total group was at low health risk regarding their waist-to-hip ratios. The group presented significant body-image distortion in all body-composition health-risk categories i. e. BMI and body-fat percentage as well as the isolated body mass value (p 0. 01). This is most likely due to the fact that the WHR is a measure of fat distribution mainly around the waist and hips, and not a measure of weight or fatness. Individuals in the "normal-weight" category for BMI presented higher BD and DT scores than those in the "under-weight" category. The same was true for the "average" and "low" fat-percentage categories. The overweight and obese categories of both the BMI and body-fat percentage parameters were underrepresented by the subjects and were consequently excluded from the conclusions. The BMl proved to be the strongest predictor of body-image distortion, with the isolated body mass value following second in line and the body-fat percentage value being the weakest, yet significant predictor of distorted body image among these subjects. Again, the WHR was of no prediction value for distorted body image among young women. These results greatly supported the literature findings and provided significant ground for the recognition of body-image distortion in young women and the development of intervention programs for this fragile population group.

Anthropometric measures of body size and mass, such as height, weight and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), have been individually associated with abnormal imaging. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the anthropometric factors that have the strongest relationship with abnormal imaging in volleyball players. Methods: Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist girth, <b>hip</b> <b>girth</b> and WHR were measured in a cohort of 113 competitive volleyball players (73 men, 40 women). The univariate (ANOVA) and multivariable (discriminant function analysis) association between abnormal imaging and these anthropometric factors were investigated. Results: No significant association was found in the female volleyball players. A significant univariate association was observed between abnormal imaging and heavier weight, greater BMI, larger waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girth</b> and larger WHR in the male volleyball players. Waist girth was the only factor that retained this association in a multivariable model (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Widespread {{increases}} in the prevalence of childhood obesity have raised the prospect of serious public health consequences in many countries. New Zealand is no exception; {{according to the most}} recent national estimates, approximately one in three children is overweight or obese. As a consequence, an understanding of the specific risk factors that predict this condition in children is becoming increasingly important. It is generally accepted that the promotion of physical activity is a key strategy for reducing the risk of childhood obesity. However, there is limited information describing physical activity and its relationship with body fatness in young New Zealanders. The overall aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the associations between excess fatness and physical activity in New Zealand children from a diverse range of socio-demographic groups. Three related studies were conducted to achieve this aim: a large descriptive survey of obesity and physical activity patterns in primary-aged children, and two preceding studies which develop the methodology for objective assessment of physical activity in this population. The first study provided the only validation data for the NL- 2000 multiday memory (MDM) pedometer in children. In a sample of 85 participants aged 5 - 7 and 9 - 11 years, the NL- 2000 offered similar accuracy and better precision than the widely used SW- 200 pedometer (NL- 2000 : mean bias = - 8. 5 ± 13. 3 %; SW- 200 : mean bias = - 8. 6 ± 14. 7 %). The second study investigated reactivity to wearing pedometers over four 24 -hour testing periods in 62 children aged 5 - 11 years. The sample was divided into two groups: one was given a full explanation of the function of the pedometer, while the other received no information prior to testing. The absence of significant differences in step counts between the first and last test periods indicated that there was no evidence of reactivity to this device for either preparation procedure. The central study presented in this thesis was the measurement of physical activity, body composition, and dietary patterns in 1, 226 children aged 5 - 12 years, from which four chapters (4 - 7) were derived. The sample was ethnically diverse, with 46. 8 % European, 33. 1 % Polynesian, 15. 9 % Asian, and 4. 1 % from other ethnicities. Physical activity levels over three weekdays and two weekend days were assessed using NL 2000 pedometers. Percentage body fat (%BF) was determined using hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis with a prediction equation previously developed for New Zealand children. Waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> height, and weight were measured using standard anthropometric techniques. Parent proxy questionnaires were used to assess demographic and lifestyle factors and pedometer compliance. The first reported analyses of this dataset (Chapter 4) examined the effect of weather conditions on children’s activity levels. In boys, a 10 ºC rise in ambient temperature was associated with a 10. 5 % increase in weekday steps and a 26. 4 % increase in weekend steps. Equivalent temperature changes affected girls’ step counts on weekdays only (16. 2 % increase). Precipitation also had a substantial impact, with decreases in weekday and weekend step counts during moderate rainfall ranging from 8. 3 % to 16. 3 % across all sex, age, and socioeconomic (SES) groups. The aim of Chapter 5 was to understand the relationship between children’s step counts and their body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and %BF. Mean step counts for this sample were 16, 133 ± 3, 864 (boys) and 14, 124 ± 3, 286 (girls) on weekdays, and 12, 702 ± 5, 048 (boys) and 11, 158 ± 4, 309 (girls) on weekends. Significant associations were detected between steps. day- 1 and both WC and %BF, but not between steps. day- 1 and BMI. The findings in Chapter 6 extended these results by estimating the number of steps required to reduce the risk of excess adiposity in children (16, 000 and 13, 000 steps. day- 1 for boys and girls, respectively). Finally, the study described in Chapter 7 examined the associations between excess adiposity and a series of demographic and lifestyle variables, providing the first assessment of body fat correlates in young New Zealanders. Our results indicated that children aged 11 - 12 years were 15. 4 times more likely to be overfat (boys, %BF ≥ 25 %; girls, %BF ≥ 30 %) than those aged 5 - 6 years. In addition, the odds of overfat were 1. 8 times greater in Asian children than in European children, and 2. 7 times greater in the low SES group when compared with the high SES group. Three modifiable behaviours related to fat status were also identified: low physical activity, skipping breakfast, and insufficient sleep on weekdays. Clustering of these risk factors resulted in a cumulative increase in the prevalence of overfat...|$|R

This paper studied the anthropometric characteristics of middle-aged Korean women to examine wearing sensibility related to body shape. The anthropometric data included stature, chest height, waist height, hip height, crotch height, bust circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference. Body measurements, front and side views and index values between girth measurements were used as the body shape comparison elements. The results obtained are as follows: 1) Bust girth, waist girth, and <b>hip</b> <b>girth</b> of middle-aged women showed greater values (6 %, 11. 4 %, and 3. 4 %, respectively) than in young women. 2) The drop value between <b>hip</b> <b>girth</b> and bust girth were 7. 3 cm in twenties, 3. 6 cm in thirties, 4. 2 cm in forties, 1. 5 cm in fifties, and 0. 7 cm in sixties. 3) For front and side shape examination, assuming a value of 1. 00 for the waist breadth and waist depth, the results in middle-aged women were 0. 7 and 1. 2 in bust and hip breadth, and 1. 1 and 1. 1 in bust and hip depth, respectively. The wearing sensibility related to body shape showed that abdomen, waist, and arm were most re-shaped elements by ageing. The results found from this study can be used effectively to design a better-fitted clothes and to revise standards for products and sizing system for maximizing users ’ satisfaction.

Recent {{research}} suggests that abdominal height, measured as sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) in either supine or standing position, reflects visceral fat and is associated with cardiovascular (c-v) disease risk. Thus, adding SAD to other common indexes of adiposity (e. g. BMI, waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girth,</b> body fat %) may provide a better prediction of disease risk. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine: 1) the feasibility of using SAD as a measure of abdominal obesity in young and older adults, and 2) the degree of association between SAD and other anthropometric and traditional c-v risk variables.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the parameters of Gompertz growth curves with the measurements of body conformation, real-time ultrasound longissimus dorsi muscle area (LMA) and backfat thickness (BFT) in Hanwoo cows. The Hanwoo cows (n = 3, 373) were born in 97 Hanwoo commercial farms in the 17 cities or counties of Gyeongbuk province, Korea, between 2000 and 2007. A total of 5, 504 ultrasound measurements were collected for the cows at the age of 13 to 165 months in 2007 and 2008. Wither height (HW), rump height (HR), the horizontal distance between the top of the <b>hips</b> (WH), and <b>girth</b> of chest (GC) were also measured. Analysis of variance was conducted to investigate variables affecting LMA and BFT. The effect of farm nested in location was included in the statistical model, as well as the effects of HW, HR, WH, and GC as covariates. All of the effects were significant in the analysis of variance for LMA and BFT (p< 0. 01), except for the HR effect for LMA. The two ultrasound measures and the four body conformation traits were fitted to a Gompertz growth curve function to estimate parameters. Upper asymptotic weights were estimated as 54. 0 cm 2, 7. 67 mm, 125. 6 cm, 126. 4 cm, 29. 3 cm, and 184. 1 cm, for LMA, BFT, HW, HR, WH, and GC, respectively. Results of ultrasound measurements showed that Hanwoo cows had smaller LMA and greater BFT than other western cattle breeds, suggesting that care must be taken to select for thick BFT rather than an increase of only beef yield. More ultrasound records per cow are needed to get accurate estimates of growth curve, which, thus, helps producers select animals with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Janet Kupperman, FACSM Rockhurst University, Kansas City, Missouri The {{measurement}} of body composition {{is integral to}} assessing fitness and included in professional competencies outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Thus, it is incumbent on faculty/programs in exercise science {{to provide students with}} experiences to promote the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to assess body composition. While it is customary to include content knowledge and some skills practice in courses like Physiology of Exercise, reflection on dispositions may occur less frequently. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to address dispositions while reviewing skills for assessing girths and skinfolds. Specifically, students explored the consequences of using techniques for measuring girths and skinfolds that do not comply with approved methods (e. g., measuring over clothing and subtracting the estimated thickness of the clothing and altered limb positioning). METHODS: Students reviewed techniques for assessing height, weight, circumferences, and skinfolds that they had previously practiced in other courses and also discussed techniques to promote subject comfort and measurement accuracy. After measuring girths and skinfolds using techniques consistent with those illustrated in their text book, students used specified non-conforming techniques for chest, waist, <b>hip,</b> and thigh <b>girths</b> and for chest, thigh, abdomen, triceps, suprailium, and subscapula skinfolds. They reflected on differences in laboratory reports and discussed professional options for dealing with situations in student and employee roles during which they could feel pressured to use methods that do not conform with best practices. RESULTS: Twenty-six students gave informed consent for their data to be included in the analysis. Difference scores (approved minus non-conforming) were calculated for girths, skinfolds, body density, and percent fat. 71. 9 % of the difference scores were lower for unapproved techniques and 25. 3 % were higher. Mean girth difference was 0. 4 ± 1. 08 inches. Mean skinfold difference was - 1. 63 ± 4. 83 mm. CONCLUSION: The activity provided students with a concrete understanding of the importance of using measurement techniques associated with best practices. Additionally, their awareness of challenges they may experience in the field was enhanced. A deliberate incorporation of dispositions as well as content knowledge and skills is suggested for classroom activities...|$|R
40|$|Tese de Doutoramento em Engenharia TêxtilNão existe no Brasil uma padronização do dimensionamento {{corporal}} da mulher aplicado à empresa do vestuário. Tal fato é justificado por diversos fatores, entre eles: o baixo investimento em pesquisas antropométricas, em particular as que utilizam tecnologias de digitalização corporal tridimensional; o fato do país ocupar um grande espaço territorial; e a mistura de raças encontradas devido ao cruzamento dos povos que tiveram maior representatividade no país, nomeadamente os Indígenas, Europeus e os Africanos. Como consequência da mistura de raças e do tamanho do território as caraterísticas corporais das mulheres Brasileiras são bem diversificadas. Com a falta de padronização das medidas, cada empresa de vestuário pode definir o seu padrão de tamanho para desenvolver os seus produtos de acordo com o mercado alvo que pretende explorar. Esta situação faz com que os usuários encontrem grandes dificuldades no momento de compra, pois tem muitas dúvidas em relação ao seu tamanho e ao ajuste do vestuário no seu corpo. Este fenómeno ocorre principalmente no comercio online. O presente trabalho tem por objetivo realizar um estudo antropométrico, com recurso a um sistema tecnológico de digitalização corporal 3 D, para estabelecer os alicerces necessários para o correto dimensionamento do corpo das mulheres Brasileiras, uma vez que os dados atualmente disponíveis à empresa de vestuário Brasileira não são suficientes, apresentando divergências entre os tamanhos atualmente utilizados na produção industrial e nas medidas do corpo feminino. A metodologia utilizada consistiu num levantamento antropométrico nos Concelhos de Braga e Guimarães, Norte de Portugal, com uma amostra de 101 mulheres Brasileiras, com idades entre 18 e os 62 anos, utilizando o método de digitalização corporal 3 D com o recurso tecnológico KBI-Kinect Body Imaging. As voluntárias preencheram um questionário e foram informadas que deveriam permanecer na posição indicada e vestindo apenas as suas peças íntimas durante o processo de digitalização do corpo. Do total das variáveis do corpo disponíveis no software KBI, foram selecionadas 36, consideradas como as mais importantes para o desenvolvimento da modelação do vestuário, nomeadamente as medidas de circunferência, altura e largura, geradas automaticamente pelo sistema para posterior análise. Os dados passaram por uma análise estatística univariada e multivariada, incluindo análise de confiabilidade, análise de componente principal e realizada a análise de agrupamento (cluster) para identificar os principais formatos corporais da amostra. Os resultados foram segmentados em cinco categorias com caraterísticas homogéneas para facilitar a construção de uma Tabela com as médias das variáveis selecionadas. Estas dimensões dividiram a amostra de acordo com a faixa etária, índice de massa corporal, Região do Brasil, cor ou raça e pelo formato corporal. Os resultados segmentados revelam as caraterísticas de tamanho e formato do corpo da amostra. As voluntárias na faixa etária entre 40 e 49 anos de idade apresentam as maiores médias de circunferência e massa corporal. Na segmentação por índice de massa corporal, 67 % estão classificadas no peso normal e 25 % no sobrepeso. Os maiores desvios padrões são encontrados nas medidas de circunferência de busto, abdómen, cintura e anca, havendo maior acúmulo de gordura nestas partes do corpo. O formato corporal retângulo foi o que apresentou maior representatividade na amostra, com um total de 40 %, seguido do formato ampulheta com 28 %. Duas empresas de vestuário Brasileiras, tiveram as suas medidas analisadas e comparadas com as medidas obtidas com o KBI. Duas peças (uma da parte superior e outra da parte inferior do corpo) foram confecionadas com ambas as medidas. A modelação e as peças prontas foram comparadas, ficando evidente que existe uma diferença considerável nos tamanhos usados nas Tabelas da empresa nacional Brasileira e os dados obtidos neste estudo. Três sistemas de dimensionamento foram desenvolvidos para a amostra pesquisada, a partir da Razão Abdómen/Estatura - RAE (Parte Superior) : Pequeno (RAE 0, 58) e Razão Anca/Estatura – RanE (Parte Inferior) : Pequeno (RAnE 0, 68), em que as medidas de intervalo para cada variável foram apresentadas em pictogramas. In Brazil, {{there is}} no standardization of the women corporal dimension applied to the garment industry. This reality is justified by several factors, among them the low investment in anthropometric research using three-dimensional technology, {{the fact that the}} country occupies a large territorial space and the mixture of races found due to the cross-breeding of the most representative populations in the country, namely the Indigenous, Europeans and Africans. As a consequence of the mixture of races {{and the size of the}} territory, the characteristics of the Brazilian women are well diversified. As a consequence of the lack of standardization of the measurements, each apparel brand can define its size standard to develop its products according to the target market served, consequently, the user finds difficulties during the purchase process, because she has doubts about its size and about the fit of the clothing on her body. This phenomenon occurs mainly during online commerce. The objective of this study is to carry out an anthropometric study using 3 D body scanning technology to establish the necessary foundations for an accurate body size for the Brazilian women, since the data currently available to the clothing industry is not enough, showing differences between the sizes currently used in industrial production and the female body measurements. The methodology used consisted of an anthropometric survey in the Counties of Braga and Guimaraes, North of Portugal, using the three-dimensional body scanning method with a sample of 101 Brazilian women, aged between 18 and 62 years, using the technological resource KBI-Kinect Body Imaging. The volunteers completed a questionnaire and were informed that they should remain in the position indicated and wearing only their underwear during the process of body digitization. From the total of variables of the body available in the software, 36 were defined as the most important ones for the development of garments, namely the measurements of circumference, height and width, in centimeters, automatically generated by the system for later analysis. Data was subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, including reliability analysis, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis to identify the main body shapes of the sample. The results were segmented into five categories with homogeneous characteristics to facilitate the construction of a table with the averages of the selected variables. These dimensions divided the sample according to age, body mass index, region of Brazil, color or race, and body shape. The segmented results reveal the size and shape characteristics of the sample body. The volunteers in the age group between 40 and 49 years of age present the highest means of circumference and body mass. In the segmentation by body mass index, 67 % are classified in normal weight and 25 % in overweight. The largest standard deviations is found in the measurements of the bust, abdomen, waist and <b>hip</b> <b>girths,</b> with a greater accumulation of fat in these parts of the body. The rectangle body shape is the one with the highest representativity in the sample, with a total of 40 %, followed by the hourglass format with 28 %. Two Brazilian clothing companies had their measurements analyzed and compared with the measurements obtained with the KBI-Kinect Body Scanner. Two pieces (one of the upper part and one of the lower part of the body) were made with both measurements. The pattern designs and the finished parts were compared, making it evident that there is a considerable difference in the sizes used in the tables of the Brazilian national apparel industry and the data obtained in this study. Three sizing systems were developed for the studied sample, from the Abdomen/Stature Ratio - ASR (Upper) : Small (ASR 0. 58) and Hip/Stature Ratio - HSR (Lower) : Small (HSR 0. 68), where the interval measurements for each variable were presented in pictograms...|$|R
