2500|$|Number {{plates were}} {{initially}} {{made by the}} motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates meeting standards could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs {{to confirm that the}} customer is the registered keeper or other authorised person and verify their identity. The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown {{at the bottom of the}} plate. Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. [...] These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a <b>fleet</b> <b>manager</b> or lease hire company).|$|E

40|$|Vehicle {{management}} may {{be considered}} to consist of traffic management, usage control, maintenance, and security. Various regulatory authorities undertake the first aspect, <b>fleet</b> <b>managers</b> will be concerned with all aspects, and owner-drivers will be interested mainly in maintenance and security. Car theft poses a universal security problem. Personalisation, including navigational assistance, might be achieved as a by-product of an improved management system. Authorities and <b>fleet</b> <b>managers</b> may find smartcards to be key components of an improved system, but owners may feel {{that the need for}} improved security does not justify its cost. This thesis seeks to determine whether smartcards may be used to personalise vehicles in order to improve vehicle management within a forseeable time and suggest when it might happen. In the process four broad questions are addressed. • First, what improvements in technology are needed to make any improved scheme using smartcards practicable, and what can be expected in the near future? • Second, what problems and difficulties may impede the development of improved management? • Third, what non-vehicle applications might create an environment in which a viable scheme could emerge? • Finally, is there a perceived need for improved vehicle management? The method involved a literature search, the issue of questionnaires to owner drivers and <b>fleet</b> <b>managers,</b> discussions with <b>fleet</b> <b>managers,</b> the preparation of data-flow and state diagrams, and the construction of a simulation of a possible security approach. The study concludes that although vehicle personalisation is possible- and desirable it is unlikely to occur within the next decade because the environment needed to make it practicable will not emerge until a number of commercial and standardisation problems that obstruct all smartcard applications have been solved...|$|R
