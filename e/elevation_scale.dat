50|$|When first {{introduced}} in the British Royal Artillery, the L7 or L7A1 dial sight and its carrier, incorporating an integral <b>elevation</b> <b>scale</b> and internal lighting powered by Trilux nuclear light sources, was used to aim the gun for indirect fire. The L7 sight is {{a modified version of}} a German Leitz instrument. Since the light gun entered service after the introduction of field artillery computer equipment (FACE), it never, unlike the Abbot, had gun rules (large slide rule like instruments used at each gun to convert range in metres to tangent elevation in mils, taking account of muzzle velocity). Therefore, it has a single quadrant <b>elevation</b> <b>scale.</b> These optical indirect fire sights are now only used in recruit training.|$|E

5000|$|The Model 11 (1922) 70 mm mortar is {{exceptional}} among Japanese mortars in that, {{although a}} muzzle-loading weapon, {{it has a}} rifled bore. The Japanese marking is [...] "11th year model high-angle infantry gun". A monopod, similar to {{the support of the}} US 4.2-inch chemical mortar, is another telling feature. The total weight of the weapon is 133.75 lb, of which 99.5 lb represents the weight of the base plate. The traverse of the piece is 410 mils (23 degrees), and its elevation is 661 to 1,370 mils (37 to 77 degrees). A gunner's quadrant is used to lay in the weapon. It has a level vial, actuated by a knob, a movable arm, and a fixed <b>elevation</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>elevation</b> <b>scale</b> is graduated in half-degree units from 0 to 55 degrees. The movable arm has a vernier scale which permits readings of 1/16th degree. Before the weapon can be fired, by means of a lanyard attached to a striker arm, a latch pin on the breech end of the tube must be set in its recess.|$|E
50|$|Now {{that the}} barrel {{remained}} {{aligned with the}} target after firing, the more primitive tangent sight was replaced with the rocking-bar sight for direct-fire sighting. These were installed on QF 4.7-inch Gun Mk I-IV quick firing gun from 1887. The rocking-bar (or 'bar and drum') sight had an <b>elevation</b> <b>scale,</b> could mount a telescope {{as well as the}} open sight, and provided a small amount of horizontal deflection. These provided 'independent line of sight' because they enabled data to be set on the mount and the telescope (or open sight) aimed at the target independent of the barrel elevation.|$|E

50|$|Tangent sights were {{introduced}} in the 19th century. These provided the rear sight used with an 'acorn' or similar foresight at the muzzle. The tangent sight was mounted in a bracket beside or behind the breech, the eyepiece (a hole or notch) was atop a vertical bar that moved {{up and down in}} the bracket. The bar was marked in yards or degrees. This direct-fire sight was aimed at the target by moving the trail horizontally and elevating or depressing the barrel. By the late 19th century the simple open tangent sights were being replaced by optical telescopes on mounts with an <b>elevation</b> <b>scale</b> and screw aligned to the axis of the bore.|$|E

50|$|The sight {{arrangement}} on the Stoner 63/63A differs {{amongst the}} various configurations. On the belt-fed LMGs, the rear sights are {{mounted on the}} top cover. These consist of a folding leaf aperture <b>elevation</b> <b>scale</b> graduated in 100 m increments from 200 to 1,000 m. The rear sight can also be corrected for windage in ¼-mil increments. When the primary sight is folded down, a battle sight aperture with a diameter of 0.09 in is exposed. The Rifle and Carbine versions have simple flip-type apertures with settings for 0-300 and 300-500 m contained between large perforated protective ears. The sights are adjustable in both windage and elevation in 1 MOA increments. All variants share the same front sight assembly—a semi-shrouded round threaded post adjustable for windage and elevation zero (similar to the M16 front sight).|$|E
50|$|The Type 97 mortar {{examined}} had {{an extension}} fitted to the sight, raising {{the latter to}} the level of the muzzle of the mortar. This extension probably was added to permit sighting of the weapon when it was deeply dug in or slightly in defilade. <b>Elevation</b> <b>scale</b> of the sight is graduated in 50-mil intervals from 700 to 1,600 mils, and a micrometer drum enables elevation readings to be made to the nearest mil. The collimator can be traversed in a full circle, and the azimuth scale is calibrated in 100-mil graduations in two sections of 3,200 mils each. As in the case of elevation, a micrometer drum permits azimuth readings to be made to the nearest mil. There is a throw-out lever for rapid traverse of the collimator, which may be placed at an angle of elevation and locked in position by a series of meshing notches. There are no open sights for rough laying of the piece.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of rain and ice depolarization on an hypothetical high altitude platform system operating in the 47 -GHz band over central Belgium, and using dual-polarized antenna arrays. An electromagnetic model based on physical parameters (rain rate, ice concentration, rain and ice anisotropy and canting angles) is first described. Time series of physical parameters are then extracted from one year of data recorded during the Olympus experiment in Belgium at 20 GHz. The prediction of attenuation and depolarization based on these parameters is then validated at 12 GHz. Finally, the prediction model is applied to HAPS scenarios by a dual frequency and <b>elevation</b> <b>scaling.</b> The specificity of HAPS is accounted for by considering a range-dependent elevation angle. Performance simulations are eventually presented and illustrate that depolarization may slightly improve the performance of polarization multiplexing schemes. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|For years {{researchers}} {{have sought to}} identify pain-prone personality types using the MMPl. Previous research suggests that pain patients typically produce one of four 2 ̆ 2 significantly 2 ̆ 2 different MMPl profiles. This paper is a meta-analysis of pain patient profiles. using computerized graphing techniques and discriminant analysis! the author compares mean MMPl profiles found in various pain populations to the Prototypic 1 - 3 and 6 - 8 / 8 - 6 profiles reported in Greene (1991). Further analysis produced a better fit between the 6 - 8 / 8 - 6 variants and a mean Dissociative Identity Disorder (D. l. D.) profile derived from profiles reported in the literature. This analysis suggests that the mean <b>scale</b> <b>elevation</b> differences previously thought to be significant are better construed as chance variations and that there are only two primary approaches to the MMPI among pain patients. The first approach results in a relatively flat and unelevated validity configuration and <b>elevations</b> on clinical <b>scales</b> one! two and three. The second approach results in a carat shaped and elevated validity configuration and <b>elevations</b> on clinical <b>scales</b> one! two! and three plus <b>elevations</b> on <b>scales</b> six! seven and eight. The author offers an explanation based in social constructivist/narrative theory for the striking profile similarities among pain patients and concludes by suggesting that future research rely more heavily on projective techniques because projective techniques place fewer restrictions on the language available to the patient to describe the pain experience...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To use cluster {{analysis}} to identify psychological profiles and related mental health symptoms among {{male and female}} juvenile offenders. Method: Juvenile offenders (N = 141) incarcerated in the California Youth Authority completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI- 2). Results: MMPI {{cluster analysis}} revealed four distinct profiles: two for male and two for female juvenile offenders. Among males, we identified one Normative cluster with no clinically elevated scores. A second male cluster, labeled Disorganized, exhibited clinical <b>elevations</b> on <b>scales</b> 8 (Schizophrenia), 6 (Paranoia), 4 (Psychopathic Deviate), and 7 (Psychasthenia). Among females, two clinically elevated profiles emerged. One Impulsive-Antisocial cluster consisted of clinical <b>elevations</b> on <b>scale</b> 4 (Psychopathic Deviate), which has been consistently associated with delinquent and antisocial behavior. The second cluster, labeled Irritable-Isolated, produced <b>elevations</b> on MMPI <b>scales</b> 4 (Psychopathic Deviate), 8 (Schizophrenia), 6 (Paranoia), and 7 (Psychasthenia). There were no significant sex, ethnicity, or offense differences across clusters, but the clusters exhibit distinct psychiatric profiles (MMPI) and mental health symptoms (MAYSI- 2). Conclusions: The findings indicate that not only do female offenders have more acute mental health symptoms and psychological disturbances than male offenders, they exhibit qualitatively distinct psychiatric profiles. Results reinforce the need for assessment of mental health symptoms {{for male and female}} juvenile offenders as well as sex-appropriate treatments. No Full Tex...|$|R
