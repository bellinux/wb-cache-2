5|$|With {{a budget}} of $230,000, the {{surviving}} original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and <b>kinescope</b> recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.|$|E
5|$|The Casino Royale {{episode was}} lost for decades after its 1954 {{broadcast}} until {{a black and}} white <b>kinescope</b> of the live broadcast was located by film historian Jim Schoenberger in 1981. It also aired on TBS as part of a Bond film marathon. However, the original 1954 broadcast had been in color; moreover the VHS release and TBS presentation did not include the last two minutes, which were at that point still lost. Eventually, the missing footage (minus the last seconds of the end credits) was found and included on a Spy Guise & Cara Entertainment VHS release. MGM subsequently included the incomplete version on its DVD and bluray releases of the 1967 spoof version of Casino Royale.|$|E
25|$|Episode #195 (February 21, 1954) only exists among {{collectors}} from {{a secondary}} <b>kinescope,</b> {{as the official}} <b>kinescope</b> was missing from the Goodson-Todman archive.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} DuMont series, no episodes {{are known to}} exist. <b>Kinescopes</b> of daytime {{television}} of the 1940s are exceptionally rare, as are <b>kinescopes</b> of local programming (since <b>kinescopes</b> were intended for time-delay purposes, all U.S. stations saw little need to record local programming, and this would remain the case for years).|$|R
5000|$|Early Australian {{television}} {{drama series}} were recorded as <b>kinescopes,</b> such as Autumn Affair and Emergency, along with variety series like The Lorrae Desmond Show. <b>Kinescopes</b> {{continued to be}} made after video-tape was introduced to Australia; most existing episodes of the 1965-1967 children's series Magic Circle Club are <b>kinescopes</b> (per listings for episodes on National Film and Sound Archive website) ...|$|R
50|$|Mama {{was filmed}} using <b>kinescopes.</b> Rice kept some <b>kinescopes</b> from the production, {{though most of}} the {{machines}} have been destroyed or thrown away, along with many of the Mama episodes. In 1985, Rice donated her <b>kinescopes</b> to the The Museum of Broadcasting, now called the Paley Center for Media, for exhibition of surviving Mama episodes. She appeared at Mama reunions and fan gatherings throughout her life.|$|R
25|$|A {{practical}} videotape {{system was}} not available until after Space Patrols run, so for distribution to distant stations the image on a small, bright TV monitor was filmed using a motion picture camera with a specially modified and synchronized shutter mechanism, creating <b>kinescope</b> recordings on 16mm or 35mm film. Most of the Saturday half-hour TV broadcasts survived in this form and so are still available today. The 15-minute weekday version {{of the program was}} at first seen mainly in the Los Angeles broadcast area, but was later also seen nationwide by syndication via <b>kinescope</b> films.|$|E
25|$|The {{existing}} <b>kinescope</b> films (now digitized) have subsequently rerun on television. The {{series has}} been seen on GSN at various times. The series is currently shown on the BUZZR network.|$|E
25|$|Panelists {{and guests}} who {{appeared}} on the original TV versions and on the stage version include Shelley Berman, Lee Meriwether, radio commentator Michael Jackson, Jayne Meadows, Nanette Fabray, Joanna Barnes, Julie Newmar, Margaret O'Brien, and Marty Ingels. Usually when such a veteran appears, there is a pristine-quality DVD screening of the original <b>kinescope</b> on a plasma screen. Non-celebrities include the lifelong Los Angeles-area resident who challenged the panel with her line, afterward reminiscing how 43 years earlier she had traveled to New York, where Arlene Francis identified her as a meter maid. A clip from the <b>kinescope</b> was played.|$|E
50|$|Another {{purpose of}} <b>Kinescopes</b> {{involved}} satisfying show sponsors. <b>Kinescopes</b> sometimes {{would be sent}} to the advertising agency for the sponsor of a show so that the ad agency could determine whether or not the sponsor's ads appeared properly. Due to this practice, some <b>kinescopes</b> have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves.|$|R
50|$|Daytime programs, however, were {{generally}} not <b>kinescoped</b> for preservation (although many were temporarily <b>kinescoped</b> for later broadcast, episodes recorded {{in this way}} were often junked). Many local station and network newscasts were prone to wiping.|$|R
50|$|Although DuMont's main {{stations}} very occasionally made <b>kinescopes</b> {{of their}} local programming (there are more surviving WABD local <b>kinescopes</b> from the late-1940s/1950s than there are for many other stations of the period), most of the local programming is lost.|$|R
25|$|CBC {{claims that}} Instant replay {{made its debut}} on a 1955 HNIC broadcast. CBC {{director}} George Retzlaff made a <b>kinescope</b> recording of a goal, and replayed it to the television audience seconds later.|$|E
25|$|January 16, 1965: Burnett and Valente are co-hosts, with Boris Karloff and Chita Rivera {{as their}} guest stars. The <b>kinescope</b> {{copy of this}} episode, widely {{circulated}} among video collectors, is the most viewed outside of its original broadcast.|$|E
25|$|A {{version was}} {{broadcast}} on ABC on Australian television in 1957. It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was kinescoped {{to be shown}} in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kinescopes</b> {{were also}} used for some live {{television}} programs, like Captain Kangaroo, when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones. As performers never went {{three times in a}} day, <b>kinescopes</b> were made for the West Coast at a later date.|$|R
50|$|U.S. {{television}} networks {{continued to make}} <b>kinescopes</b> of their daytime dramas available (many of which still aired live into the late 1960s) as late as 1969 for their smaller network affiliates that {{did not yet have}} videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming. Some of these programs aired up to two weeks after their original dates, particularly in Alaska and Hawaii. Many episodes of programs from the 1960s survive only through <b>kinescoped</b> copies. The last 16 mm <b>kinescopes</b> of television programs ended in the late 1970s, as video tape recorders became more affordable.|$|R

25|$|Bogart and Bacall {{also worked}} {{together}} on an early color telecast in 1955, an NBC adaptation of The Petrified Forest for Producers' Showcase, with Bogart receiving top billing and Henry Fonda playing Leslie Howard's role; {{a black and white}} <b>kinescope</b> of the live telecast has also survived.|$|E
25|$|While Bogart rarely {{performed}} on television, he and Bacall appeared on Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person {{in which they}} disagreed in answering every question. Bogart was also featured on The Jack Benny Show. The surviving <b>kinescope</b> of the live telecast captures him in his only TV sketch comedy outing.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} {{it was assumed that}} the film (<b>kinescope)</b> of the {{original}} telecast had been lost, but a copy was found, transferred to video, and is now available at The Paley Center for Media (formerly The Museum of Television & Radio) and online at the Museum of Broadcast Communications.|$|E
50|$|Reportedly 102 of the 127 episode <b>Kinescopes</b> of Mister Peepers survive.|$|R
50|$|These {{shows were}} {{preserved}} on <b>kinescopes</b> and released on home video.|$|R
50|$|Although {{examples}} of WABD's local shows {{are known to}} exist from {{as far back as}} 1948, such as Swing Into Sports and Photographic Horizons, none are known to exist from 1947. The series is most likely lost, and likely was never <b>kinescoped</b> in the first place, as <b>kinescoping</b> was still a very new technology.|$|R
25|$|CBWT began {{extending}} its signal using various methods, {{beginning in}} June 1962 with CBWBT in Flin Flon and CBWBT-1 in The Pas using <b>kinescope</b> recordings from CBWT Winnipeg. Later on, CBTA in Lynn Lake {{became part of}} the Frontier Coverage Package in September 1967. From 1968 onwards, CBWT used the province-wide microwave system to provide live television signals.|$|E
25|$|Cinderella was {{broadcast}} live on CBS on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini {{and had an}} estimated 107million viewers. The show {{was broadcast}} in colour from CBS Studio 72, at 2248 Broadway in New York City. Only a black-and-white <b>kinescope</b> remains, which has been released on DVD. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance.|$|E
25|$|Reginald Rose's {{screenplay}} for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for television (starring Robert Cummings as Juror 8), and was broadcast {{live on the}} CBS program Studio One in September 1954. A complete <b>kinescope</b> of that performance, which had been missing for years and was feared lost, was discovered in 2003. It was staged at Chelsea Studios in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Very few <b>kinescopes</b> of the DuMont {{version of}} Johnny Jupiter have survived.|$|R
50|$|All of the NBC Symphony Orchestra telecasts with Arturo Toscanini, from 1948 to 1952, were {{preserved}} on <b>kinescopes</b> {{and later}} released on VHS and LaserDisc by RCA and on DVD by Testament. The original audio from the <b>kinescopes,</b> however, {{was replaced with}} high fidelity sound that had been recorded simultaneously either on transcription discs or magnetic tape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kinescopes</b> of ten episodes {{from the}} series were {{discovered}} in a closet by Carson's second wife Joanne and released by Shout Factory on DVD in 2007. Joanne Carson says the <b>kinescopes</b> were hand-picked by Carson as a courtship gift to her and featured his favorite episodes from the series. Additional episodes survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.|$|R
25|$|On April 24, 1960, {{the station}} became English-only, while French {{programming}} {{moved to the}} newly launched CBWFT. At the same time two VTRs, worth $75,000 each were installed at the station to replace the <b>kinescope</b> system used previously. The local version of Reach for the Top debut in 1962 and was hosted by Bill Guest, alternately by Ernie Nairn. The program ran until 1985.|$|E
25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series <b>kinescope</b> films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several <b>kinescope</b> films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and F. Lee Bailey. Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E
25|$|From 1950 to 1966, {{the game}} show was {{broadcast}} in black-and-white, as {{was typical of}} most game shows at the time. But by 1966, all three networks were broadcasting their prime-time schedules entirely in color, including What's My Line? After the show ended in 1967, CBS replaced the color videotapes with the <b>kinescope</b> versions instead for syndication. As {{a result of this}} change, the 1966–1967 episodes of What's My Line? were only shown in black-and-white after the show ended.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>kinescopes</b> of Cavalcade of America survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} DuMont series, no episodes {{are known to}} exist, as live local shows were very rarely <b>kinescoped</b> for many years. Additionally, 1940s daytime {{television}} series are poorly preserved as a whole, {{with only a few}} scattered <b>kinescopes</b> known to be held by television archives (one of which, an experimental one-off telecast of the Breakfast Club radio show, aired on WABD).|$|R
