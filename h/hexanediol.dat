For a given membrane compositiin, Pd/DKnc (where D is the diffusion constant in water) {{is the same}} for most of the molecules tested. There is no extraordinary dependence of Pd on molecular weight; thus, given Pd(acetamide), Pd(1, 6 <b>hexanediol)</b> is correctly predicted from the Knc and D values for the two molecules. The major exceptions are H 2 O, whose value of Pd/DKnc is about 10 -fold larger, and urea, whose value is about 5 -fold smaller than the general average.

Cubic and lamellar phase formulations enhanced the fluorescein permeation through the stratum corneum. A solution system had the weakest permeability compared to the other two phases. Due to the amphiphilic nature of GMO, cubic and lamellar phases might reduce the barrier function of stratum corneum which was observed by CLSM as fluorescein accumulated in the dermis.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the mitotic apparatus (MA) can be isolated from dividing sea urchin eggs in water buffered at pH 5. 6 and that the addition of 1 M <b>hexanediol</b> to the solution raises the usable pH to 6. 4. Long chain glycols appeared to be much more effective than related compounds in increasing the stability of the MA, and the aim of the investigations reported here was to determine the basis of this specificity. These experiments show that this impression of specificity is misleading and that under suitable experimental conditions a variety of compounds can be substituted for the glycols. A number of alcohols will duplicate the action of the glycols in stabilizing the MA at pH 6. 4, but they must be used at a similar per cent concentration rather than at a similar molar concentration. Increases in the concentration of alcohol or glycol allow isolation at more alkaline pH values, and a pH-concentration relation for the stability of the MA, covering the range from pH 5. 6 - 8, has been determined. These results indicate that the action of these compounds in stabilizing the mitotic apparatus is non-specific and is similar to their effects on the solubility of proteins. The isolation and stabilization of the mitotic apparatus can thus be viewed {{as a function of the}} solubility properties of its constituent proteins, opening a variety of new experimental approaches to this problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAimTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} acetylcholinesterase on the cytotoxicity of three autopolymerizing acrylic reline resins through {{the effect of the}} materials’ eluates, liquids and respective pure compounds on the cellular viability of primary dermal fibroblasts cultures. MethodsDisk shaped specimens of two direct Acrylic Reline Reins (ARR), Kooliner and Ufi Gel Hard, and one indirect ARR, Probase Cold, were studied. Cytotoxicity was studied through spectrophotometric determination of tetrazolium reduction (MTT assay) and lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH assay). Moreover, at least 7 concentrations of each liquid and compound were prepared to determine the IC 50 parameter. All data were evaluated using Kruskall–Wallis or Mann–Whitney test, after verification with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. ResultsThe fibroblasts exposed to the direct ARR eluates resulted in inhibition of the mitochondrial activity. Probase Cold eluates did not diminish cellular viability. LDH remained unaltered when fibroblasts were exposed to the eluates. Acetylcholinesterase groups of direct reline resins showed to be less cytotoxic when compared with control groups without changing their cytotoxic potential. The non-cytotoxic effect of Probase Cold did not change. The cytotoxicity of the pure compounds increased in the following order: Methacrylic Acid (MA), Isobutyl Methacrylate (IBMA) and <b>Hexanediol</b> Dimethacrylate (HDMA). Methyl Methacrylate (MMA) showed no cytotoxicity at the concentrations used. The direct reline resins liquids and respective pure compounds exhibited similar behavior. ConclusionsAcetylcholinesterase did not change the cytotoxic potential of the reline resins studied. HDMA and IBMA revealed higher levels of cytotoxicity than MA, and their behavior was similar to the respective liquids...|$|E
40|$|Copolymers of telechelic poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene ether) (PPE) segments, uniform crystallisable tetra-amide units (T 6 T 6 T, 6 – 15 wt%) and {{different}} diols (C 2 –C 36, polytetramethylene oxide) as an extender were synthesised. The telechelic PPE segment was end-functionalised with terephthalic ester groups {{and had a}} molecular weight of 3100 g/mol. The coupling between the PPE segment and the T 6 T 6 T unit was made with diols. The influence of the length and flexibility of the diol-extender and the concentration of the T 6 T 6 T units were studied on the thermal (DSC) and thermal–mechanical (DMA) properties of the copolymers. A crystalline T 6 T 6 T phase in the copolymers was evident from 9 wt% onwards. The length of diol extender {{had an effect on}} the glass transition temperature of the PPE phase, the crystallinity of the T 6 T 6 T segments and modulus above the glass transition temperature. With ethylene glycol the Tg of the copolymer was high but the crystallinity of the T 6 T 6 T rather low. With dodecanediol or <b>hexanediol</b> as an extender the Tgs of the PPE phase were somewhat lower, but the crystallinities of the T 6 T 6 T segments higher. With C 36 and polytetramethylene oxide diols, the Tg were strongly decreased and broad and the modulus above the glass transition temperature not so high...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{attraction of}} cerambycid beetle species to blends of known cerambycid pheromones {{to determine whether}} such blends {{could be used as}} effective trap lures for detecting and monitoring multiple species simultaneously. Pheromone-baited traps captured 1, 358 cerambycid beetles, of which 1, 101 (81. 1 %) belonged to three species in the subfamily Cerambycinae: Neoclytus acuminatus (F.), Neoclytus mucronatus (F.), and Xylotrechus colonus (F.). Beetles of these species were significantly attracted to synthetic blends that contained their pheromone components (isomers of 3 -hydroxy- 2 -hexanone and/or 2, 3 -hexanediol), despite the presence of pheromone components of different species, including other isomers of 2, 3 - <b>hexanediol,</b> (E/Z) - 6, 10 -dimethyl- 5, 9 -undecadien- 2 -yl acetate, and citral. In some cases attraction was partially inhibited by the pheromone components of heterospecific species, whereas for N. acuminatus, attraction was completely inhibited when blends contained (2 R*, 3 S*) -hexanediol, the racemic mixture of diastereomers of its pheromone, (2 S, 3 S) -hexanediol. Among the remaining beetles captured were three species in the subfamily Lamiinae: Astyleiopus variegatus (Haldeman), Graphisurus fasciatus (Degeer), and Lepturges angulatus (LeConte). All three lamiine species were previously known to be attracted to (E/Z) - 6, 10 -dimethyl- 5, 9 -undecadien- 2 - yl acetate, and were captured in significant numbers by blends containing that compound. Our results suggest that different types of cerambycid pheromones can be combined to create effective multi-species lures for use in surveillance programs that target exotic cerambycid species...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of 5 '-lipophilic capture tag is described, {{enabling}} the facile reverse phase HPLC purification of chemically modified hammerhead ribozymes (oligozymes) whilst still carrying the 2 '-O-tert. -butyldimethylsilyl protection of the essential riboses. In its most convenient form, the capture tag consists of a simple diol, such as hexan- 1, 6 -diol, which at one end is attached via a silyl residue to a highly lipophilic entity such as tocopherol (vitamin E) or cholesterol, and the other end is functionalized as a phosphoramidite. This lipophilic capture tag is added as the last residue in the solid-phase synthesis of chemically modified hammerhead ribozymes. Cleavage from the support and release of all protecting groups except for the silyl groups is achieved with ethanolamine/ethanol. The crude product is then loaded directly on to a reverse phase HPLC column. Separation of failure peaks from full length product is achieved easily using a short run time. The retarded product peak is collected, lyophilized, desilylated in the normal way and then desalted. This method removes the lipophilic capture tag yet leaves behind the <b>hexanediol</b> entity which helps protect the compound against degradation by 5 '-exonucleases. The purity of the product as judged by analytical anion-exchange HPLC and capillary gel electrophoresis is generally better than 95 % full-length, and yields of 2 - 4 mg from a 1 micromol scale synthesis are routine. In addition, the method can be readily scaled up, an important feature {{for the development of}} such chemically modified ribozymes as potential therapeutics...|$|E
