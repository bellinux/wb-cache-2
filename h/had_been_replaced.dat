5|$|The Victor was {{the last}} of the V-bombers to be retired, the final {{aircraft}} being removed from service on 15 October 1993. In its refuelling role, the type <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the Vickers VC10 and the Lockheed Tristar.|$|E
5|$|Valve ejected during filling due {{to thread}} failure, sank dive boat. Vented {{bursting}} disk retainers in the cylinder valves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by solid screws.|$|E
5|$|By the Roman Period of Egypt, the {{traditional}} Egyptian reed pen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> {{by the chief}} writing tool of the Greco-Roman world: a shorter, thicker reed pen with a cut nib. Likewise, the original Egyptian pigments were discarded in favor of Greek lead-based inks. The adoption of Greco-Roman writing tools influenced Egyptian handwriting, as hieratic signs became more spaced, had rounder flourishes, and greater angular precision.|$|E
50|$|BS 25999-2 was {{withdrawn}} in November 2012 <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the International Standard, ISO 22301. BS 25999-1 {{was withdrawn}} in early 2013 <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by ISO 22313.|$|R
50|$|The first {{item in the}} list, I/me, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> in none of the 140 {{languages}} {{during their}} recorded history; the fifteenth, dead, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> in 25% of the languages.|$|R
5000|$|Since then, Green Line [...] "E" [...] {{service to}} Arborway <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the 39 bus, and Green Line [...] "A" [...] service <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the 57 bus.|$|R
5|$|In 1708, E. Hatton {{recorded}} the inscription below the clock as Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas in his New View of London {{and did not}} mention a figure above it. The date 1715 is shown on the clock-case in the 1717 volume of Vitruvius Britannicus, so perhaps indicates the clock <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> and the inscription changed to Sic transit gloria mundi as shown here.|$|E
5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though he noted that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. He felt that the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by newer shooter games.|$|E
5|$|Linebacker Antarrious Williams was {{scheduled}} to miss the game after undergoing surgery to repair a dislocated bone suffered in the Tigers' game against Georgia. Williams had 44tackles during the regular season, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by Derrick Graves in the SEC championship game. Graves was expected to do so again in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
50|$|Since 2009, some {{modernisation}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{carried out}} at the station. Thus, the passenger information systems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b> Facilities on the platforms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> modernised and lifts to the platforms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of 2012, keyboardist Victor Mazanek {{has left}} the band. He <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by Pavel Dvořák of Warhawk. In 2012, Radek Rain also resigned, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with Lukáš Říha.|$|R
50|$|The old {{building}} appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a housing complex, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> {{by a new}} building at 275 W. Market Street. The new building was dedicated on May 2, 1976.|$|R
5|$|Quenya nouns are {{declined}} for case. Parmaquesta Quenya has ten cases. These {{include the}} four primary cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and instrumental; three adverbial cases: allative (of which the dative is a shortened form), locative (also with a shortened form), and ablative; and a possessive or adjectival case. The accusative was however only used for Parmaquesta and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by nominative in late colloquial Quenya.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. These <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, behind {{the front line of}} hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with velites, who had a similar role but were also {{attached}} to principes and triarii.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{difference}} between [...] and [...] is that the lower right entry [...] in [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with [...] and similarly, in [...] the top left entry [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with [...]|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} book, Evil Star, when Matt visits Nexus, the member Dravid <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced,</b> so there <b>are</b> twelve members again. However, in Necropolis, neither he or Fabian <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> and there <b>are</b> only ten members.|$|R
5000|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{changes made}} {{specific}} to [...] "The Last Day". The opening {{shot of the}} post pod approaching Red Dwarf <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with a CGI sequence. Hudzen's ship approaching Red Dwarf <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with a CGI version.|$|R
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the earlier {{priority}} of good sea {{air on the}} pier <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with a desire for public entertainment. The pier reached record levels of attendance in the early 20th century, attracting around 1.5 million visitors between 1910 and 1911. Attendance fell due to the onset of World War I, but resumed afterwards, with around 2 million people visiting between 1918 and 1919.|$|E
50|$|Samsung {{announced}} the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphones on 29 March 2017. It features an iris scanner, {{which was not}} present on the Galaxy S7 phones. S Voice <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by Bixby. In addition, the micro-USB port <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a USB Type-C port, and the physical home button and capacitive buttons <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by on-screen buttons.|$|R
25|$|All {{the music}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
50|$|That enchanted feeling <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, {{frequently}} losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train {{and went on to}} Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this loss}} of sponsorship, Davies {{completed}} his studies and graduated in 1913. His plans to enter the ministry were abandoned; he was {{an active member of}} the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and his religious vocation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by a commitment to working-class politics. In 1913, while still a student, he stood for election to Cardiff's Board of Guardians, as the ILP candidate in the Grangetown ward. This first foray into electoral politics ended in a narrow defeat, by 47 votes.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} R. W. Goodwin recalls {{being on}} {{location for the}} episode's opening scene, in which Detective Barbala is thrown from a window. The room used for the scene had two windows side-by-side, and one <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with sugar glass for the stunt. When the false window was blown out to simulate someone being thrown through it, the crew found that the glass window beside the false one had also accidentally been blown out. The episode's key grip, Al Campbell, suggested that the next shot show Barbala's dog lying beside his body to explain the second window breaking.|$|E
50|$|The ECIP <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by ESSIP.|$|R
50|$|Later graveyards <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by cemeteries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game had}} a {{slightly}} different look and feel from the previous Carmen Sandiego titles. For instance, the Chief <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with an alien whose words are translated onscreen. Henchpeople <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> with [...] "henchthings." [...] The game includes the franchise's trademark pun-based humour.|$|R
5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and {{destined for the}} scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild her as a target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Hull Bridge {{upstream}} of Beverley, {{which had}} caused so much disagreement in the 18th century until it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> in 1801, was demolished by the County Council, who installed a steel rolling bridge in its place. Once the Tickton Bypass bridge {{had been built}} a short distance upstream, it no longer needed to carry road traffic, and it {{was replaced by a}} footbridge in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Some Canadian and British {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} temporarily equipped with M7 Priest self-propelled guns for the D-Day landings, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by towed 25-Pounder field guns. Simonds had the Priests converted into Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers, {{which would allow}} infantry to follow the tanks closely on any terrain. Permission was first requested from the Americans, from whom the M7s had been borrowed, to convert them into APCs.|$|E
60|$|If {{then our}} diagram {{be assumed to}} {{represent}} {{a considerable amount of}} modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by eight new species (a14 to m14); and (I) will <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by six (n14 to z14) new species.|$|R
60|$|The {{original}} spelling, capitalisation and punctuation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> retained {{as far as}} possible. Characters not in the ANSI standard set <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> {{by their}} nearest equivalent. The AE & OE digraphs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> transcribed as two letters. Accented letters in the Italian poems <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> by the unaccented letter.|$|R
