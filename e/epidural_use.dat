40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrathecal opioids used {{to relieve}} labor pain have been {{associated}} with uterine hyperactivity and nonreassuring fetal heart rate abnormalities. We retrospectively evaluated all charts of singleton, term, vertex-presenting parturients in active labor requesting neuraxial pain relief during a 1 -year period for the occurrence of nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings. METHODS: Three different strategies to relieve labor pain were routinely used in our department: conventional <b>epidural</b> <b>using</b> 10 mL bupivacaine 0. 125 % and sufentanil 0. 75 microg/mL; combined spinal and <b>epidural</b> (CSE) <b>using</b> intrathecal sufentanil (7. 5 microg); and CSE using intrathecal bupivacaine (2. 5 mg) and sufentanil (1. 5 microg). Charts (n = 1, 293) were evaluated for nonreassuring fetal heart tracings and uterine hyperactivity as well as for neonatal and labor outcome. RESULTS: Intrathecal sufentanil (7. 5 microg) produced significantly more nonreassuring tracings and uterine hyperactivity. However, this did not result in more cesarean deliveries or detrimental neonatal outcome. CONCLUSION: Based on this retrospective analysis, we conclude that intrathecal sufentanil in a dose of 7. 5 microg has the potential to result in more nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings compared with both intrathecal analgesia using a bupivacaine (2. 5 mg) /sufentanil (1. 5 microg) mixture and <b>epidural</b> analgesia <b>using</b> bupivacaine, sufentanil, and epinephrine.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the association of intrapartum temperature elevation with cesarean delivery and assisted vaginal delivery. METHODS: Participants were 1233 nulliparous women with singleton, term pregnancies in vertex presentations who had spontaneous labors and were afebrile (temperature: 99. 5 degrees F [37. 5 degrees C]) at admission for delivery. Rates of cesarean and assisted vaginal deliveries according to highest intrapartum temperature were examined by epidural status. RESULTS: Women with maximum intrapartum temperatures higher than 99. 5 degrees F were 3 {{times as likely to}} experience cesarean (25. 2 % vs 7. 2 %) or assisted vaginal delivery (25. 2 % vs 8. 5 %). The association was present in epidural users and nonusers and persisted after birthweight, <b>epidural</b> <b>use,</b> and labor length had been controlled. In adjusted analyses, temperature elevation was associated with a doubling in the risk of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 5, 3. 4) and assisted vaginal delivery (OR = 2. 1, 95 % CI = 1. 4, 3. 1).

Previous research has examined whether epidural analgesia used for pain control during labor and birth {{is associated with a}} lower risk of PPD, but reports conflicting results and may have suffered from methodological shortcomings. Our study aimed to prospectively assess whether epidural analgesia is associated with a lower risk of PPD (at either 6  weeks or 6  months postpartum) after attempting to adequately adjust for selection bias and confounding variables. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of urban Canadian mothers who were recruited at birth in Calgary, Canada, in 2010, for a primary study on predictors of PPD. Mothers with full-term, singleton infants who did not require neonatal intensive care unit admission of > 24  hours were included, and filled out questionnaires at birth, 6  weeks and 6  months postpartum including demographics, birth data, maternal and infant physical health, lifestyle, breastfeeding and maternal mental health. Descriptive statistics were calculated for participant characteristics and to identify potential confounder variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess whether epidural analgesia is associated with PPD after controlling for available confounding variables. Results: Our study included 206 mothers who had vaginal deliveries and were free of depression at delivery. We found an incidence of PPD of 13. 3 % (n= 27) and no statistically significant association between <b>epidural</b> <b>use</b> and PPD, regardless of adjustment for potential confounding variables (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 69 – 1. 22; adjusted OR (for body mass index 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 40 – 2. 77).

According to the mode of anesthesia, the patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 29 patients who received epidural anesthesia with ropivacaine; 2) 29 who had <b>epidural</b> anesthesia <b>using</b> lidocaine. The indices of cardiac performance (stroke volume, stroke index, and cardiac output), blood (diastolic, systolic, and mean) pressure, vascular parameters (linear blood flow velocity, total peripheral vascular resistance) were determined by volumetric compression oscillometry.
