40|$|Weed control {{represents}} {{a major issue}} not only in agriculture but also in nursery production of ornamental species. This is also a key problem in nursery container production, where weeds can relevantly affect the aesthetical and commercial value of the plants. Usually this problem is overcome using liquid or granular herbicides or special disks (i. e. co- co-fibre disks) which suppress/avoid weed emergence. However, the use of herbicides {{is often associated with}} possible environmental drawbacks while the disks may represent a relevant cost for the farmers. Moreover no natural substances with herbicide action are la- belled in Italy for nursery production at the moment. In this respect, a specific trial has been carried out at the University of Pisa since 2012 in order to test different physical weed control methods, which may be a possible alternative to herbicide application and disk use in nursery container production. The treatment where made in Photinia × fraseri, growth in common commercial pots filled by peat-based potting soil artificially infested by Oxalis corniculata L. Two different physical treatments were compared: - flaming performed with a trolley machine connected to a manual lance equipped with a 10 cm wide open <b>flame</b> <b>rod</b> burner; - steaming performed with a professional steam generator (power 2. 4 kW and steam outflow 3. 12 kg h- 1) equipped with a manual lance and an on purpose designed and realized dis- penser. Two different frequencies were tested for both the thermal applications. This trial is still on-going but the preliminary results showed that steaming could represent a real effective and economically sound system of weed control in nursery container produc- tion. However, further studies to closely evaluate steaming performance and long-period ef- fectiveness as well as generator efficiency are needed in order to optimize this technique...|$|E

Compressed air/inert gas is used to drive consumable to the substrate. These coatings can show low bond strength, high oxide content and high porosity. The process has a reasonable spray rate and low cost. Flame Spraying comprises low-velocity powder flame, wire <b>flame</b> and <b>rod</b> <b>flame</b> process, and high velocity processes such as HVOF and the detonation gun process [82].|$|R

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the rate of {{increase}} in temperature of a ZrO 2 - 8 Y 2 O 3 thermal barrier coated (TBC) specimen for various values of fuel/air (F/A) ratios when the specimen is exposed to a 0. 3 Mach burner <b>flame.</b> For <b>rod</b> specimens in a carousel, the heating rates increased with (F/A) ratio and were higher at the inward facing surface for a given (F/A). Plate specimens were more sensitive to burner variations. Calculated results are given for the radial stress in the coated rod specimens for variations in (F/A) ratios from 0. 04 to 0. 065. Over this range, the radial stress varies from 4. 3 to 5. 3 MPa. The results indicate that controlling the heating rate of a TBC by controlling the (F/A) ratio offers a potential method to prolong TBC cyclic life; uncontrolled (F/A) ratios will produce scatter in experimental results. Geometric arrangement can have an equivalent effect, but is usually fixed by design...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism of carbon combustion and to assess the importance of gravitational induced convection on the process, zero and normal gravity experiments were conducted in which spectroscopic carbon rods were resistance ignitied and burned in dry oxygen environments. In the zero-gravity drop tower tests, a blue <b>flame</b> surrounded the <b>rod,</b> showing that a gas phase reaction in which carbon monoxide was oxidized to carbon dioxide was taking place. The ratio of <b>flame</b> diameter to <b>rod</b> diameter was obtained {{as a function of}} time. It was found that this ratio was inversely proportional to both the oxygen pressure and the rod diameter. In the normal gravity tests, direct mass spectrometric sampling was used to measure gas phase concentrations. The gas sampling probe was positioned near the circumference of a horizontally mounted 0. 615 cm diameter carbon rod, either at the top or at angles of 45 deg to 90 deg from the top, and yielded concentration profiles of CO 2, CO, and O 2 as a function of distance from the surface. The mechanism controlling the combustion process was found to change from chemical process control at the 90 deg and 45 deg probe positions to mass transfer control at the 0 deg probe position {{at the top of the}} rod. Under the experimental conditions used, carbon combustion was characterized by two surface reactions, 2 C + O 2 yields 2 CO and CO 2 + C yields 2 CO, and a gas phase reaction, 2 CO + O 2 yields 2 CO 2...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a recently developed numerical technique, the Flexible Local Approximation Method (FLAME) to compute the resonances of 2 D photonic crystal (PC) cavities, formed by a defect in a regular array of dielectric <b>rods.</b> <b>FLAME</b> is a finite-difference-like method which is ideally suited to problems consisting of large numbers of identical structures. The anisotropic perfectly matched layer (PML) is used as an artificial absorbing layer to truncate the computational domain. The parameters of the PML are chosen carefully to provide adequate absorption without a large computational cost. FLAME method and PML boundaries are applied to cavities with 3 x 3, 5 x 5 and 7 x 7 arrays of rods. The resonant modes, field distribution, and quality factor are computed and compared with previously-published results. Good agreement is obtained. However, the matrix eigenproblem generated by FLAME is of a kind for which sparse-matrix algorithms are not available and dense-matrix software had to be used. This limitation will have to be overcome if FLAME is to be widely used for PC cavities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} a numerical effort to predict pollutant {{species such as}} CO and NO formed in premixed turbulent flame using an extended coherent flame model. This model is used to predict pollutant emissions of methane-air combustion. A semi-global kinetic scheme is tested, using a two steps reaction mechanism of Westbrook and al. The model combines coherent flame model to estimate the CO formation and the well-stirred reactor concept for calculating the NO and all other species which {{are taken into account}} in this investigation. Essentially, we assume that CO is analysed near the flame zone because is formed with very fast intermediate reaction compared to the other characteristic times. Other species formed with longer time are supposed to take place in high temperature region where can be consider that corresponding kinetics are best represented by homogeneous reactor conditions. Numerical results for emission species and dynamic parameters in premixed flame of methane-air are given for a duct combustor where the flame is stabilised behind a <b>rod</b> <b>flame</b> holder with a blockage ratio is taken as 6 % and a mass flow rate m(a) = 35 g/s...|$|R
40|$|Live, axenic {{zoospore}} suspensions {{are required}} for testing foliage susceptibility of different hosts, for investigating the inoculum potential of susceptible host leaves {{as well as the}} effects of inoculum density on disease expression, and for studying the bark infection process. Although P. ramorum forms sporangia naturally, the method for maximising their production under lab conditions is described here. Inoculum: Isolates are cultured on carrot agar (CA) (Brasier 1967, 1969) as stock cultures. • Take plugs from the margins of actively growing cultures, transfer to CA and inoculated plates placed lids uppermost, in continuous day light (60 -W bulbs; Daylight Company, UK suspended 30 cm above the plates) for 14 days. • To harvest sporangia, flood each plate with 5 ml sterile water (a) and, using a <b>flame</b> sterilised glass <b>rod</b> (spreader), rub the colony surface to dislodge the sporangia into the liquid (b). • Collect the sporangial suspension in a sterile beaker, incubate in a refrigerator at 7 °C for 1 hr, then return to room temperature for a further 75 min to induce zoospore release (Parke et al., 2002). • Vacuum filter the zoospore suspension through a sterile 10 -μm Millipore filter to remove the sporangia cases (c). The zoospore concentration in the suspensions can be quantified and adjusted to requirements. References...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTransfer {{functions}} of premixed laminar flames submitted to incident flow perturbations are envisaged and a unified model is derived analytically. This model, {{based on a}} linearization of the G-equation for an inclined flame, includes convective effects of the flow modulations propagating upstream of the flame. It is shown that the flame dynamics is governed by two relevant parameters, a reduced frequency, omega*, and {{the ratio of the}} flame burning velocity to the mean flow velocity, SL/V, or equivalently the flame angle alpha with respect to the flow direction. In the limit of low driving frequencies, the flame motion is only controlled by omega* and the unified model reduces to previous kinematic formulations derived for rim stabilized conical flames and V-flames anchored on a central <b>rod.</b> <b>Flame</b> transfer functions for these flame geometries with the different velocity models proposed are derived and limiting cases are examined. In the conical flame case, the low-frequency model gives a good approximation of the gain, but only a fair approximation of the phase. Convective effects are shown to induce an increasing phase lag, while low-frequency models predict a saturation phenomenon. The convective model derived in this article improves results for the gain and the phase which agree with numerical simulations and experiments. It is shown in particular that 1) the correct transfer function phase trend is retrieved and depends on the flame angle a; 2) the reduced cut-off frequency corresponds to a situation where the convective wavelength along the flame front lambda = Vcos(alpha) /f equals the flame length L; and 3) the flame response is weakly affected by the amplitude of these perturbations. In the V-flame case, the low-frequency model yields a good approximation of the phase but does not feature gain values in excess of one found in the simulations. This behavior is correctly predicted by the convective model and is shown to depend on the flame angle alpha. A V-flame behaves as an amplifier in a certain range of frequencies. It is shown that these types of flames are more susceptible to combustion instabilities than conical flames. The V-flame response is also shown to strongly depend on the amplitude of the fluctuations even for moderate perturbation levels...|$|R
