Siew Luan goes into shock. At the funeral, Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses. Mei vents her anger on Chin Keong, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor and storming off. Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. Chin Keong expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, [...] "Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> choice?" [...] and returns to work. At work, Mei's boss, frustrated at the incapable temporary secretary, vents his anger at Mei and demands her to photocopy a stack of documents and brew coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Big Frame began {{investigating}} {{the demographics of}} channels that {{are now part of}} Wonderly in an attempt to bring together creators and community. In an interview, Big Frame talent manager and Wonderly head Rachel Skidmore said: [...] "... We saw, for example Squaresville and Life According to Jimmy—we saw that their audiences were kind of similar and it was this really amazing group of teen to early twenties girls that were rabid fans. We realized that it wasn’t necessarily the content that was bringing them together but their obsession, in the coolest way. These were girls that, even though they were subscribed to both channels, were also posting about books on Tumblr or they had their own channels; they were just super fans. So we thought “How <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> place where these creators can come together and sort of geek out together?” We started digging in and after many brainstorming sessions and hours of work and lots of pizza, Wonderly came to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011 Ash {{collaborated with}} We Are Scientists {{to release a}} cover of the song [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by British {{songwriter}} Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society. The song was recorded between London and New York by the two bands and join a project already boasting releases from Ed Hardcourt and Emmy the Great. Chris Cain from We Are Scientists {{said in an interview}} [...] "We actually recorded a single [...] which {{is going to come out}} soon. It won't be too long until it's out and it's for a charity in England called the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It's a cover of a song called [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by I think Happy Monster but it's pretty sweet. The concept of the song is that if you listen to it on headphones or stereo the musicians of Ash are on the left channel and all the We Are Scientists guys are playing it in the right channel. We're playing the same song essentially but in different ways. I'm not playing the same bass line as Mark and Rick isn't playing the same drum pattern as Andy. I think Keith and Tim sing the same thing but in a different sort of harmony. What's interesting especially is that not only <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> unison feel going on but you can also take off one headphone and hear one band and vice versa." ...|$|E
