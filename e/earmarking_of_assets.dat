50|$|In 2016, Reuters {{reported}} that the European Commission estimated that the EU's nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets</b> to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. Among EU member states still operating nuclear plants, only Britain's operators have enough dedicated assets to cover the expected costs, 63 billion euros, the Commission's draft working paper finds. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets</b> to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs, while a stress test carried out by Germany’s Economy Ministry late last year showed the provisions made by the country’s utilities - E.ON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall VATN.UL - were adequate. Decommissioning costs vary according to reactor type and size, location, the proximity and availability of disposal facilities, the intended future use of the site and {{the condition of the}} reactor at the time of decommissioning. Although decommissioning might gradually become cheaper, the cost of final waste depositories is largely unknown and costs could also grow, rather than shrink, over the many decades in question. The European Commission declined to comment on an unpublished document and has not confirmed when the report will be officially published.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, National Treasury Republic of South Africa {{explored}} earmarking, {{along with}} recycling and tax shifting, as ways of using carbon tax revenues. While the Treasury did [...] "not support full <b>earmarking</b> <b>of</b> revenues generated from environmental taxes" [...] they were considering [...] "partial 'on-budget' <b>earmarking</b> <b>of</b> some revenue. At that time concerns were raised that {{special interest groups}} could constrain government and control public resources through earmarking.|$|R
30|$|In this vein, the {{investigation}} of the new approaches contributes to the RBV. As mentioned in the introduction, the RBV is divided into resources and capabilities where resources are the ‘stock of available factors’ and capabilities are the ‘capacity to deploy resources […] using organizational processes, to effect a desired end’ (p. 35). However, three of eight concepts remain low in taxonomy without any organizational process or systematic approach and four of eight are rather in the beginning of becoming systematic. The complex R&D top-down approach is replaced by a simple bottom-up approach through the combination <b>of</b> <b>earmarked</b> <b>assets.</b> Even though that it sounds trivial, the bottom-up approach creates marketable product solutions at a low cost level that usual market participants, i.e. foreign companies, could not reach. Hence, these concepts complement the RBV by adding ecological aspects as resources, i.e., the reintegration of obsolete resources/former technologies of other companies as replacement of missing (own) resources without additional costs. Another aspect is the setting of the civil society, here people at the BoP, as strategic industry factor. In a nutshell, the new approaches complement the RBV by considering the civil society as strategic industry factor as well as using obsolete resources by dint of the reintegration which is missed in the traditional RBV.|$|R
