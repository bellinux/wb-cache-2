5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The <b>Judge</b> <b>has</b> manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|The trial <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of}} the juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E

5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E

25|$|In a {{district}} court (käräjäoikeus), ordinary judges {{work with the}} title käräjätuomari and the chairman is laamanni (lawspeaker). They are assisted by notaries (notaari), asessors (asessori) and referendaries (viskaali) who may sometimes even chair sessions. In appeals courts (hovioikeus) an ordinary <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> the title hovioikeudenneuvos, the chairman of a section is hovioikeudenlaamanni and the court is led by a presidentti. In the Supreme Court, judges are titled oikeusneuvos and the court is led by a presidentti.|$|E
25|$|Parole is {{an option}} for most prisoners. However, parole is not guaranteed, {{particularly}} for prisoners serving life or indeterminate sentences. In cases of first-degree murder, one can apply for parole after 25 years if convicted of a single murder. However, if convicted of multiple murder (either first or second-degree), the sentencing <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> the option to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span.|$|E
25|$|Therefore in 2117 three {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the system by her new successor, Chief Judge Volt. Firstly, he reformed the Council of Five by removing the chief judge from the Council (although {{it is not clear how}} their respective powers are divided between the chief judge and the Council, and the chief judge may still attend Council meetings). Since then the deputy chief <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> chaired most meetings of the Council of Five (the first to do so was DCJ Herriman.) The appointment of a deputy chief judge must have the consent of the Council. This has given some measure of independence to the Council in its deliberations, and provided a constitutional method by which an incapable chief judge can be lawfully removed from office.|$|E

25|$|In terms section 176(1) of the Constitution, {{judges of}} the Constitutional Court serve for a non-renewable term of 12 years or {{until they reach}} the age of 70, {{whichever}} is earlier; but these limits may be extended by an Act of Parliament. Section 4 of the Judges Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act 47 of 2001 has extended the term limit to an effective term of 15 years including prior service on other courts: the effect is that judges who had served more than 3 years before their appointment to the Constitutional Court retain a 12-year term limit; {{those who did not}} have a longer tenure. The same section extends the retirement age to 75. However, in terms of section 3(2)(b), if the <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> already been a judge (in any court) for 15 years by the time she reaches the age of 65, she may voluntarily retire.|$|E
25|$|The Encyclopedia was {{the fruit}} of a {{continuing}} processing of documents gathered {{from many of the}} thousands of the international organizations profiled in the Yearbook of International Organizations. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the Encyclopedia. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades. The Institute of Cultural Affairs International was contractually associated at one point to the edition and other aspects of the Encyclopedia project. The Goals, Processes and Indicators of Development project (led by Johan Galtung) of the United Nations University, in which Anthony Judge participated on behalf of the UIA between 1978 and 1982, was an experience of learning and research that {{had a significant impact on}} the editorial content of the Encyclopedia. Another noticeable influence came from futures studies, with which <b>Judge</b> <b>has</b> long been associated. He reports in Encyclopedia Illusions how the narrow focus of the Club of Rome on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.|$|E
