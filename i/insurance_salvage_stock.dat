25|$|At {{half past}} midnight on Friday 6 October 1854, the mill was {{discovered}} {{to be on}} fire; the cry was raised and immediately the streets crowded with people hurrying {{to the scene of}} the growing conflagration. The fire being confined to the upper stories of the building, efforts were made to <b>salvage</b> <b>stock</b> on lower floors; but the great quantities of oil in the premises, used to treat wool, added fuel to the fire and quickly curtailed the attempts. Despite the prompt attendance of the North British and Newcastle fire engines, within an hour the building was one mass of flame and within two the roof fell in and the building was a total wreck.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{appeals to}} the New York Board of Fire Underwriters and the City Council, the Fire Patrol's [...] "ratchets rang for the last time" [...] at 0800 on October 15, 2006. The New York Fire Patrol became the last of all the <b>Insurance</b> {{supported}} <b>salvage</b> corps {{to operate in the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|The first {{station at}} Sea Palling was {{established}} in 1840 from local private funds {{as part of the}} Norfolk Shipwreck Association, drawn from the Marine <b>salvage</b> <b>insurance</b> monies gained from rescuing sailors from local ship wrecks. This provided funds for two locally made wooden oar and sail lifeboats, both of which came {{under the control of the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1858. At this time, although the lifeboat crews were volunteer local fishermen, so often were they called out that they continued to be paid from the <b>salvage</b> <b>insurance</b> funds, which resultantly supplemented the local fishing industry. As a result of increased activity, a second station with its own lifeboat {{was established in}} 1870.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1930s {{the service}} was accused of {{participating}} in a criminal arson scandal. At the trial of Leopold Harris in 1934, he testified {{that he had had}} nearly every Salvage Corps officer [...] "in his pocket". Harris was later sentenced to 14 years in jail. Captain Brymore Eric Miles, chief of the <b>insurance</b> companies' <b>salvage</b> corps was sentenced to four years in jail for [...] "corruption and conspiring to pervert the administration of justice." [...] The arson ring took £500,000 in false insurance claims.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the equipment carried by Grasp, the US Navy Supervisor of <b>Salvage</b> maintains a <b>stock</b> of additional emergency fly-away salvage equipment that can be deployed aboard the salvage ships to support {{a wide variety of}} rescue and salvage operations.|$|R
5|$|Mary Celeste {{was built}} in Spencer's Island, Nova Scotia, and {{launched}} under British registration as Amazon, in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by Mary Celestes crew, piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out <b>insurance</b> or <b>salvage</b> fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891 the Hilton Hotel (not to be {{confused}} Hilton Hotels & Resorts est.1919) which {{was described as a}} grandiose two-storeyed, 14-roomed hotel, was burnt to the ground when H.D.D Homes deliberately set fire to in an attempt to <b>salvage</b> <b>insurance</b> money. [...] The hotel had fallen on hard times and Homes would later be charged and sentenced to four years penal servitude.|$|R
5000|$|Fanny was {{an armed}} {{merchantman}} that sailed between Liverpool and South America. Her master was James Laughton, {{the father of}} Sir John Knox Laughton. On 5 December 1812, Laughton was granted a Letter of Marque for the ship. On 19 April 1814, the American privateer schooner General Armstrong captured her, though shortly thereafter [...] recaptured her. The <b>insurance</b> and marine <b>salvage</b> issues involved gave rise to three notable court cases.|$|R

2500|$|John Dooly, Jr. assumed {{responsibility}} for the day-to-day operation of the ranch in about 1902. He focusing on raising sheep. The Fielding Garr Ranch {{became one of the}} most industrialized and largest sheep ranching operations in the western United States.

50|$|Marine {{surveying}} {{is often}} {{closely associated with}} marine <b>insurance,</b> damage and <b>salvage,</b> accident and fraud investigation as insurers generally lack the training and skills required to perform a detailed assessment of the condition of a vessel. While marine surveyors are sometimes employed by insurers directly they maintain a certain professional autonomy {{in order to provide}} an unbiased view. Independent marine surveyors are often employed by the clients of marine insurers to provide evidence in support of damage claims made against the insurer. Insurance companies cannot require customers to use specific marine surveyors (although they often provide a list of recommended or pre-approved marine surveyors who are known to them).|$|R
5000|$|The Moorhouse Tunnel was {{completed}} in a much shorter time than envisaged; and consequently the Ferrymead Railway was officially closed on 9 November 1867, {{the same day as}} the railway line to Lyttelton was opened. Following the subsequent conversion of the Main South Line to 3' 6" [...] (1067 mm) gauge, all its broad gauge rolling stock was sold back to Australia. The ship they were placed on was wrecked off the New Zealand coast, but the cargo was <b>salvaged.</b> The rolling <b>stock</b> then lay abandoned for almost 100 years until the advent of Ferrymead Historic Park.|$|R
50|$|When {{planning}} {{this structure}} Donn Barber, the architect, {{was aware of}} the imminent demolition of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. That church, while built only twelve years before and acclaimed as one of Stanford White's finest works, was being displaced by an expansion of the Metropolitan Life <b>Insurance</b> Company. Barber <b>salvaged</b> not only the six green granite columns but also the pilasters, pulling them flush with the columns to transform the church's porch motif of five bays into a colonnade motif of seven bays. It proved necessary to replace the original Corinthian capitals with Ionic and to add a plinth to each column base to provide the desired height for the number of stories of the new building. The original steps, platforms and base courses are all fitted together as in the original church and the terra-cotta cornices were carefully adapted. The circular-headed windows from the 24th Street facade of the church serve as the doors of the Times Building. The openings in the arcade of the Times Building are also all repurposed windows or doors from the Church's portico and southern facade.|$|R
50|$|John Dooly, Sr. {{purchased}} {{the island for}} one million dollars and established the Island Improvement Company. Dooly {{is responsible for the}} introduction of the bison, and the foundation of the Antelope Island bison herd. He brought twelve bison to the island. Four bulls, four cows, and four calves were transported by boat on February 15, 1893. At the time there were fewer than 1,000 head of bison in all of North America. Historians speculate that Dooly introduced the herd to the island for commercial purposes with the idea of establishing a rare opportunity for hunters to take the nearly extinct American bison. The twelve bison became the foundation of the Antelope Island bison herd that numbers between 500-700 animals, {{making it one of the}} largest and oldest publicly owned American bison herds in the United States.John Dooly, Jr. assumed responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the ranch in about 1902.

50|$|The first {{building}} on Culver-Stockton Campus was Old Main, {{known today as}} Henderson Hall. Construction began in 1853 and was completed in 1855. The building was destroyed by fire on March 23, 1903. In keeping with a tradition that carries on today, students didn’t miss one day of school. Officials organized classes in local churches. College President Carl Johann resolved to rebuild; and within 10 days of the fire, the citizens of Canton raised $15,000 for a new building. The college collected $8,000 from <b>insurance</b> and <b>salvaged</b> $4,000 worth of stone and brick from the old building. The new building was completed and occupied by May 15, 1904. Since funds were still short to complete payment, orator and three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan spoke on campus on August 24, 1904, to help raise funds. Since the original building had a dome, a dome also {{was part of the}} new construction. The dome on Henderson Hall continues to be an important symbol of the College to this day. Henderson Hall originally housed science laboratories, men’s and women’s gymnasiums, a museum, a dining room, a “commercial” department, library, administrative offices, classrooms, an assembly hall that seated about 600 with a rolling door at the rear that could be opened to add 400 more spectators, and three meeting rooms for student groups. As educational activities were dispersed to other buildings, Henderson Hall continued to serve, as it does today, as a primarily administrative and classroom building. The new building was named for Dr. Pat Henderson, one of the founders and first president of the board of trustees. Henderson was a church leader, an editor and publisher of religious publications, and a tireless public servant. He was instrumental in the founding of Eureka College and Columbia College in addition to Culver-Stockton. He served in several governmental social service capacities during and after the Civil War. He was an outspoken advocate of education for women. Henderson Hall was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|R
