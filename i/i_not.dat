At the 2006 Moscow International Film Festival for Children and Youth, <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too captured the Children's Jury Award. The film was also nominated for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards, but lost to Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.|$|E
5|$|Neo and Rebecca Leow co-wrote the script, {{which was}} {{completed}} in May 2005. <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too was produced by MediaCorp Raintree Pictures on a budget of S$1.5 million. Shanghai Film Studio had agreed to co-produce <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too with Raintree Pictures, but backed out because they found the film too liberal. The production crew included Daniel Yun as executive producer, Chan Pui Yin and Seah Saw Yan as producers, Ardy Lam as cinematographer and Mo Ju Li as sound editor. Besides writing and directing, Neo starred as Mr. Yeo and composed the theme song, which was sung by Hong Junyang.|$|E
5|$|Released in cinemas on 9 February 2002, <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid earned over S$3.8 million, {{becoming}} the second-highest grossing Singaporean film. Its satirical {{criticism of the}} Singaporean education system and social attitudes in Singapore sparked public discussions and parliamentary debates that led to reforms in the education system. Its sequel, <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too, was released in 2006.|$|E

5|$|With {{earnings}} of over S$1.41 {{million in the}} first six days, <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too achieved the biggest opening for a Singaporean film. The movie rose {{to the top of the}} local box office, beating Jet Li's Fearless. In total, <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too grossed over S$4 million, becoming Singapore’s second-highest grossing movie after Money No Enough. The film was then released in Malaysia, where it made RM1.1 million, and Hong Kong, taking in HK$3.1 million. Following the success of the two <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid films, Neo has announced plans to make more sequels, as well as a remake set in China.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid, a sequel was suggested, but Neo had {{difficulty}} finding a suitable topic. His inspiration was a book on appreciation education, a method of teaching developed by Chinese educator Zhou Hong. Through the movie, Neo hoped to capture the culture of Singapore {{at the turn of}} the millennium, and to explore the issue of poor parent-child communication.|$|E

Several members of the cast also said that <b>I</b> <b>Not</b> Stupid Too inspired them to communicate better with their family members.

5|$|The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount {{led to a}} {{legal dispute}} over the Countess of Leicester's {{remaining}} property. In this context she claimed that Blount, {{in the process of}} paying off Leicester's debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of ElizabethI in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> only restored her grandson, the third Earl of Essex, to his father's title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost £4,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David <b>I,</b> <b>not</b> only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E
