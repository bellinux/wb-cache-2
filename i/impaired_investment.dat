40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current jurisprudence of expropriation in investment treaty arbitration. For investors, the expropriation of local companies or factories {{in foreign countries}} is the biggest of all foreseen risks, but expropriation itself is not illegal under international law, and is illegal only when it does not satisfy certain conditions. Currently, most investment treaties provide explicit conditions, namely that the measures (1) are done for a public purpose, (2) are not discriminatory, (3) are taken under due process of law, and (4) are accompanied by payment of compensation. Today, the issues frequently disputed in investment treaty arbitration are not whether or not government actions satisfy these four requirements, {{but whether or not}} those government acts (regulations, etc.) could be regarded as "expropriation. " Once an act is deemed as expropriation, the government must pay the investors compensation at the level stipulated in the investment treaties. This has become especially controversial when these acts (regulations, etc.) are not aimed directly at acquiring the assets of investors, but have other objectives such as environmental protection. Recognizing the widest possible range of invasive government regulations as expropriation would protect investment more broadly. On the other hand, the expansion of the scope of acts for which payment of compensation is obligatory would lead to a marked increase in the cost of government regulations. This issue of how to achieve a balance between protecting investment and maintaining a degree of freedom in the implementation of government regulations has been debated on many occasions, but a clear concept that will guide arbitral tribunals has not yet been identified. This paper {{examines the}} way in which arbitral tribunals approach this issue, and makes the following observations. In order to be deemed expropriation, {{there needs to be a}} "substantial degree" of interference of property rights. In many cases disputing whether or not regulations should have been regarded as expropriation, expropriation was not found on the grounds that this requirement had not been met. In some cases where certain regulations have caused serious impairment of investment, tribunals have denied the finding of expropriation. This paper shows two approaches to making such judgments. In addition, in judging whether interference has amounted to "substantial degree" or not, the following points are of importance: whether control and management of the investment remain in the hands of the investors, the extent to which rights and interests are recognized as being important, and how the entirety of the <b>impaired</b> <b>investment</b> is delineated. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether responsible investing practices expose the institution {{to the risk of}} <b>impaired</b> <b>investment</b> performance over the long term is not settled, but in many countries, notably within the European Union, legislation requiring consideration of responsible investment practices has been in place for several years and assets invested using responsible investing practices are substantial and growing, mainly among European public pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. In the United States, such legal requirements have been absent from the investment picture, but incentive programs designed to promote conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, which have long been in place at the federal level and within or among individual states, have led to a patchwork of regulations and subsidies without [...] until now [...] an overarching national framework. Civil society has also played a role, as students and faculty on many U. S. college campuses have focused on the presence in endowments' investment portfolios of assets related to carbon-based or fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas, demanding that trustees divest the portfolio of these assets. The divestment campaign is well-organized and articulate, but possible proposed federal regulatory changes will be of more immediate concern to trustees. Two major initiatives [...] one domestic and one international in scope [...] have recently brought into sharper focus the steps that may be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in coming years and decades, both in the U. S. and on a global scale. Implementation of the international Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas emissions and the proposed federal Clean Power Plan, both discussed more fully below, could lead to a reduction in the value of carbon-based assets currently carried on the balance sheets of oil-, coal- and gas-related companies. If there is a reasonable possibility that these assets could be revalued downward, owning them at their current value today could be viewed in hindsight as imprudent or excessively risky from a fiduciary point of view. For fiduciaries that accept this argument, the quandary is how to maintain a diversified portfolio that seeks to maximize long-term, risk-adjusted returns consistent with the institution's investment policy {{while at the same time}} responding to the possibility that carbon-based assets may become a material risk to future portfolio performance. In this paper, we describe the present situation and its implications for the future of carbon-related assets; summarize the investment implications for various categories of energy-related assets; and outline a range of actions that trustees may want to consider in deciding which path to take...|$|E

40|$|Our aim in {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of mandatory audit firm rotation (MAR) on companies' investment decision and auditor choice in a capital market setting. We compare a MAR regime with a non-MAR regime in a setting in which auditors' independence and companies' opinion shopping are real concerns. To capture auditor independence and opinion shopping, we model auditor biases (a conservative bias or an aggressive bias) and client firms' incentives to engage auditors with desired biases. We find that when firms engage in opinion shopping, MAR improves investment efficiency for some firms but <b>impairs</b> <b>investment</b> efficiency for other firms. More generally, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating the real effects of auditing on corporate resource allocation decisions.

CHP (Combined Heat & Power) is a vested term referring to thermal power generation with heat recovery. The lack of clear terminology on CHP activities causes confusion and suboptimal regulation, what <b>impairs</b> <b>investment</b> decisions. An improved discourse on CHP is significant in addressing the issues. It starts at the basic definition of CHP itself. A proper definition is instrumental in identifying what the real merit of CHP is, also questioning whether high-quality CHP is a valid term. The proper yardstick of CHP performance is quantities of cogenerated electricity. In extraction-condensing steam turbines, being the most applied thermal power processes, the quantities are not directly observable. The scientific community failed to provide practical methods to assess the quantities. Basic engineering thermodynamics suffice to construct the needed methods, easy to apply and supporting investment in high-quality thermal power units and daily maximization of heat recovery. The epilogue questions the role thermodynamic machinery may play in future electric power generation. am 201...|$|R
40|$|To decarbonize {{the power}} sector {{policy-makers}} need {{to commit to}} long-term credible rules for climate and energy policy. Otherwise, time-inconsistent policy-making will <b>impair</b> <b>investments</b> into low-carbon technologies. However, the future benefits and costs of decarbonization are subject to substantial uncertainties. Thus, {{there may also be}} societal gains from allowing policy-makers the discretion to adjust the policies as new information becomes available. We examine how this trade-off between policy commitment and discretion affects the optimal intertemporal design of policies to support the deployment of renewable energy sources. Using a dynamic partial equilibrium model of the power sector, we show that commitment to state-contingent renewable subsidies outperforms both unconditional commitment and discretion. The choice between the practically more feasible approaches of unconditional commitment and discretion is analytically ambiguous. A numerical illustration with na assumptions suggests that policy discretion may outperform unconditional commitment in terms of welfare. However, extensions to more realistic cases where only a limited fraction of climate uncertainty resolves, where future policy-makers have own agendas, or with risk-averse investors show commitment as favorable...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress (an {{overproduction}} of reactive {{oxygen species}} in relation to defense mechanisms) may restrict investment in life history traits, such as growth, reproduction, lifespan, {{and the production of}} sexual signals to attract mates. The constraint on sexual signaling by oxidative stress is of particular interest because it has been proposed as a mechanism ensuring that only good-quality males produce the most attractive sexual signals. Despite these predictions, evidence supporting this theory is, at best, equivocal. We used a superoxide dismutase knockout mouse to demonstrate that oxidative stress directly <b>impairs</b> <b>investment</b> in morphological (preputial glands) and molecular (major urinary proteins) components of olfactory signaling essential for mate attraction. By maintaining males in a much more competitive environment than usual for mouse laboratory experiments, we also revealed a range of phenotypes of superoxide dismutase deficiency not observed in previous studies of this mouse model. This range included impaired bioenergetic function, which was undetectable in the control environment of this study. We urge further examination of model organisms in seminatural conditions and more competitive laboratory environments, as important phenotypes can be exposed under these more demanding conditions...|$|R
40|$|Stability and {{normalization}} {{should be}} the crucial ingredients of Kosovo's future status. If achieved, {{it would lead to}} strong economic recovery in Kosovo and to more sustainable economic growth in Serbia. Chances for positive economic development, strong recovery and sustained long-term growth are significant if normalization is achieved. Kosovo's potential growth rate could be close to 7 % to 8 % per year in the medium run while Serbia could sustain a convergence growth rate above 5 % per year. Both would also benefit from a 'peace dividend', i. e., lower security costs. Of the scenarios considered (i) full Serbian sovereignty, (ii) substantial autonomy for Kosovo, (iii) supervised independence in accordance with Ahtisaari's Plan, and (iv) Serbian and Kosovo partnership of some sort, only the last one would provide for a significant decline of risks, for increased investment and trade, for improved prospects of EU integration and for strong recovery in Kosovo and sustained growth in Serbia, whereas any solution that would be rejected by any of the parties would trigger increased fiscal and security costs and <b>impair</b> <b>investment</b> and GDP.

Both of these cardinal features of neuropathy might be linked to <b>impaired</b> neurofilament <b>investment</b> of axons. Since neu-rofilaments form the critical structural latticework of axons, their importance in neuropathy is of interest. We tested directly the relationship of neurofilaments to dia-betic neuropathy by superimposing streptozotocin-gener-ated diabetes on a unique but viable transgenic mouse described by Eyer and Peterson. These mice express a fusion protein in which the carboxyl terminus of the high molecular weight neurofilament protein (Nf-H) was replaced by b-galactosidase, in turn blocking normal neu-rofilament export and rendering axons completely lacking neurofilaments. Despite similar levels of hyperglycaemia...|$|R

The growth rate of individual loans in our dataset is decomposed into bank, firm, industry and common shocks. Adverse bank shocks are found to <b>impair</b> firm-level <b>investment</b> in all firms in our sample, but in particular for small firms and those with no access to alternative financing sources.

They repeatedly clamored for regulation of the freight and passenger rates fixed by railroad companies. Agricultural interests in the Great Plains states were particularly active in seeking regulatory legislation. Railroad investors and managers, on the other hand, opposed regulatory laws and defended their autonomy to determine rates. They feared that governmental control of rates would benefit shippers and farmers at the expense of the railroads by imposing unreasonably low charges. Moreover, they asserted that regulation of rates would likely <b>impair</b> capital <b>investment</b> and thus stifle railroad growth and economic development...|$|R

40|$|Vascularization {{defects in}} genetic {{recombinant}} mice have defined critical roles {{for a number}} of specific receptor tyrosine kinases. Here we evaluated whether an endothelium-expressed receptor tyrosine phosphatase, CD 148 (DEP- 1 /PTPη), participates in developmental vascularization. A mutant allele, CD 148 ΔCyGFP, was constructed to eliminate CD 148 phosphatase activity by in-frame replacement of cytoplasmic sequences with enhanced green fluorescent protein sequences. Homozygous mutant mice died at midgestation, before embryonic day 11. 5 (E 11. 5), with vascularization failure marked by growth retardation and disorganized vascular structures. Structural abnormalities were observed as early as E 8. 25 in the yolk sac, prior to the appearance of intraembryonic defects. Homozygous mutant mice displayed enlarged vessels comprised of endothelial cells expressing markers of early differentiation, including VEGFR 2 (Flk 1), Tal 1 /SCL, CD 31, ephrin-B 2, and Tie 2, with notable lack of endoglin expression. Increased endothelial cell numbers and mitotic activity indices were demonstrated. At E 9. 5, homozygous mutant embryos showed homogeneously enlarged primitive vessels defective in vascular remodeling and branching, with <b>impaired</b> pericyte <b>investment</b> adjacent to endothelial structures, in similarity to endoglin-deficient embryos. Developing cardiac tissues showed expanded endocardial projections accompanied by defective endocardial cushion formation. These findings implicate a member of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family, CD 148, in developmental vascular organization and provide evidence that it regulates endothelial proliferation and endothelium-pericyte interactions...|$|R
50|$|While USPAP {{provides}} a minimum set of quality control {{standards for the}} conduct of appraisal in the U.S., it does not attempt to prescribe specific methods to be used. Rather, USPAP simply requires that appraisers be familiar with and correctly utilize those methods which would be acceptable to other appraisers familiar with the assignment at hand and acceptable to the intended users of the appraisal. USPAP directs this through what is called the Scope of Work rule. At the onset of an assignment, an appraiser is obligated to gather certain specified preliminary data about the project, such as the nature of the property to be appraised, the basis of value (e.g. market, <b>investment,</b> <b>impaired,</b> unimpaired), the interests appraised (e.g. fee, partial), important assumptions or hypothetical conditions, and the effective date of the valuation.

40|$|MBA - WBSFinancial Derivatives {{are some}} of {{financial}} markets innovations {{that have been the}} subject of debate particularly with respect to their impact on the volatility of the price of the underlying asset.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the changing boundaries of statehood resulting from transformations {{in the nature}} and operation {{of public and private}} authority over local and global politico-legal orders. Transformations in the political purposes of states are being driven by powerful elites who advance a new form of constitutional governance. New constitutionalism, as evidenced by the investor-state regime, subordinates the interests, purposes, and rights of national citizens to those of foreign, transnational politico-legal, and economic elites. This regime is a highly privatized order that is expanding in influence, both in terms of the commercial activities under its remit, and in terms of its procedural operation and its normative influence. The specific focus of this paper is on the investor-state regime, which is contributing to the expansion of private power and authority in the settlement of investment disputes. This regime is effecting two transformations in the scope and nature of statehood. One transformation involves the imposition of severe limits upon the legislative and policy autonomy of national governments that are being developed and enforced by private commercial actors without public accountability. In agreeing to protect the private property rights of foreign investors against legislation or public policy that might <b>impair</b> foreign <b>investment,</b> states are also limited in their abilities to ensure the protection of the social, economic, or human rights of their peoples. However, this expansion of private power and authority is generating a countermovement in the form of resistance to the regime. This resistance is giving rise to a conflicting transformation in statehood as national governments seek to regain their policy and legislative autonomy. In some cases, the impetus comes from local sources, while in others it emanates from global and international human rights fora. This paper begins with an overview of the operational nature of the investor-state regime and new constitutionalism, revealing how the procedural and substantive provisions of the regime reach deep inside states to set clear limits on their legislative and policy autonomy. It then examines a selection of cases before investor-state tribunals that reveal contestation and resistance to the regime through the reassertion by state governments of their sovereignty and through the influence of international human rights. It concludes with an exploration of the potential for this regime to advance human rights protections and suggests a few changes that might enhance the regime 2 ̆ 7 s democratic legitimacy...|$|R

40|$|In {{the wake}} of its 2001 {{economic}} crisis, Argentina implemented a series of emergency measures. These measures - terminating the peso's peg to the U. S. dollar and freezing the gas tariff adjustment mechanism - seriously <b>impaired</b> the foreign <b>investment,</b> which had been lured to Argentina by the privatization of the gas industry, and other government measures promoting foreign investment in the 1990 s. Injured foreign investors sought compensation through arbitration and filed claims for damages against the Republic of Argentina by referring to the relevant provisions under the bilateral investment treaties (BITs) between their respective home countries and Argentina. In the series of arbitration cases, Argentina sought to justify the emergency steps it had taken {{in response to the}} economic crisis by invoking the doctrine of state of necessity under customary international law and the security interest clause under the relevant BIT. Arbitral tribunals were split in their decisions on such claims. Some tribunals dismissed them, while others accepted or suggested the possibility of accepting Argentina's defenses. The tribunals were inconsistent with one another both in interpretation of law and evaluation of the facts with respect to the relationship between customary international law and BITs, the seriousness of the crisis, {{the degree to which the}} Argentine government contributed to the crisis, and the existence of a state of necessity to justify the emergency measures taken by Argentina. Such confusion among arbitration decisions is attributable to the fact that the quoted exception/exemption provisions are extremely generally termed, and that these provisions are, in principle, intended for situations constituting grave and imminent peril in political or military terms and do not necessarily apply in the case of economic difficulties. As evidenced by the series of Argentine cases, such shortcomings of the aforesaid general exception/exemption provisions as an economic safeguard clause could discourage host countries from making significant commitments in investment treaties and, contrary to the intended purpose of such treaties, undermine the predictability of the investment environment. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the arbitral tribunals interpreting and applying the exception/exemption provisions - or even the entire investment arbitration system - could be seriously undermined. In order to solve these problems, future investment treaties should include an economic safeguard clause that is viable in light of the recognition that an investment treaty plays a crucial role in protecting investments, particularly in developing countries whose economic bases remain vulnerable. Such a clause has already been included in the draft text of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) negotiated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, as well as in some progressive and recent BITs. However, it is necessary to create a more comprehensive institutional mechanism capable of efficiently responding to economic crises by taking into consideration the implications of the Argentine incidents, as well as trade remedies under international trade law. ...|$|R
