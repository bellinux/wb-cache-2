In patients with large deletions which include additional genes, it is termed Greig cephalopolysyndactyly-contiguous gene syndrome (GCPS-CGS). It is generally believed that the deletion size correlates with disease severity. Nearly all cases appear to be a result of GLI 3 de novo deletions. Chromosome analysis of our patient revealed a large deletion in chromosome 7 (p 13 &ndash;p 14).

40|$|<b>Greig</b> cephalopolysyndactyly <b>syndrome</b> (GCPS) is a {{multiple}} congenital malformation characterised by limb and craniofacial anomalies, caused by heterozygous mutation or deletion of GLI 3.

40|$|AbstractThe {{zinc finger}} {{transcription}} factor GLI 3 {{is considered a}} repressor of vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. In humans, the absence of GLI 3 function causes <b>Greig</b> cephalopolysyndactyly <b>syndrome,</b> affecting {{the development of the}} brain, eye, face, and limb. Because the etiology of these malformations is not well understood, we examined the phenotype of mouse Gli 3 −/− mutants as a model to investigate this. We observed an up-regulation of Fgf 8 in the anterior neural ridge, isthmus, eye, facial primordia, and limb buds of mutant embryos, sites coinciding with the human disease. Intriguingly, endogenous apoptosis was reduced in Fgf 8 -positive areas in Gli 3 −/− mutants. Since SHH is thought to be involved in Fgf 8 regulation, we compared Fgf 8 expression in Shh−/− and Gli 3 −/−;Shh−/− mutant embryos. Whereas Fgf 8 expression was almost absent in Shh−/− mutants, it was up-regulated in Gli 3 −/−;Shh−/− double mutants, suggesting that SHH is not required for Fgf 8 induction, and that GLI 3 normally represses Fgf 8 independently of SHH. In the limb bud, we provide evidence that ectopic expression of Gremlin in Gli 3 −/− mutants might contribute to a decrease in apoptosis. Together, our data reveal that GLI 3 limits Fgf 8 -expression domains in multiple tissues, through a mechanism that may include the induction or maintenance of apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Truncation {{mutations}} of the GLI 3 {{zinc finger}} transcription factor can cause <b>Greig</b> cephalopolysyndactyly <b>syndrome</b> (GCPS), Pallister–Hall syndrome (PHS), and postaxial polydactyly type A (PAP-A). GLI 3 is homologous to Drosophila Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which regulates the patched (ptc), gooseberry (gsb), and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes. Ci is sequestered in the cytoplasm and {{is subject to}} posttranslational processing whereby the full-length transcriptional activator form (Ci 155) can be cleaved to a repressor form (Ci 75). Under hedgehog signaling, the Ci 155 form translocates to the nucleus whereas {{in the absence of}} hedgehog, the Ci 75 form translocates to the nucleus. Based on the correlation of GLI 3 truncation mutations and the human phenotypes, we hypothesized that GLI 3 shows transcriptional activation or repression activity and subcellular localization similar to Ci. Here we show that full-length GLI 3 localizes to the cytoplasm and activates PTCH 1 expression, which is similar to full-length Ci 155. PHS mutant protein (GLI 3 -PHS) localizes to the nucleus and represses GLI 3 -activated PTCH 1 expression, which is similar to Ci 75. The GCPS mutant protein has no effect on GLI 3 -activated PTCH 1 transcription, consistent with the role of haploinsufficiency in this disorder. The PAP-A mutant protein (GLI 3 -PAP-A) showed less specific subcellular localization but still inhibited GLI 3 -activated PTCH 1 transcription, suggesting it may be a weaker allele than the GLI 3 -PHS mutation. These data show that GLI 3 mutations in humans mimic functional effects of the Drosophila ci gene and correlate with the distinct effects of these mutations on human development...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in GLI 3 {{manifest}} in several distinct clinical phenotypes including <b>Greig</b> cephalopolysyndactyly <b>syndrome</b> and Pallister–Hall syndrome (PHS). GLI 3 {{belongs to the}} GLI family of transcription factors that mediates extracellular Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signals. In the absence of SHH signals, GLI 3 is processed to form a transcriptional repressor termed GLI 3 R. During early limb development, the regulation of GLI 3 proces-sing by SHH is decisive in determining the correct number and identity of digits. Analyses of mouse embryos have produced evidence that elevated levels of GLI 3 R {{reduce the number of}} developing digits. Remarkably, PHS causative mutations are predicted to produce a truncated protein similar to the endogenous GLI 3 R. Nevertheless, polydactyly is frequently observed in PHS patients and it even represents a criterion for the clinical diagnosis of PHS. In order to detect the underlying cause of this obvious discrepancy, we made use of the Gli 3 D 699 mouse mutant, which represents the mouse model of PHS. We show that the mutant murine allele gives rise to a truncated version of GLI 3 that mimicks both the processed GLI 3 R isoform and the proposed pathogenic GLI 3 PHS protein. We analyzed how the mutant GLI 3 protein interferes with the ante-roposterior patterning of early limb development, whereas processes that are associated with the outgrowth of the limb bud remain remarkably unimpaired. The presented findings help to understand the previously enigmatic emergence of Pallister–Hall associated polydactyly and thus add {{to the understanding of the}} pathogenic mode of the action of GLI 3 PHS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: GLI is an oncodevelopmental gene in the {{vertebrate}} hedgehog/patched {{signaling pathway}} that is spatiotemporally regulated during development and is amplified in {{a subset of}} human cancers. GLI is the prototype for the Gli-Kruppel family of transcription factors, which includes the Drosophila segment polarity gene ci, the C. elegans sex-determining gene tra- 1, and human and mouse GLI 3, all of which contain a conserved domain of five C 2 -H 2 zinc fingers. GLI 3 mutations have been implicated in the mouse mutant extra toes, {{as well as in}} human <b>Greig</b> cephalopolydactaly <b>syndrome</b> and the autosomal dominant form of Pallister-Hall syndrome. As such, GLI and the vertebrate hedgehog/patched signaling pathway appear to play important roles in both normal development and neoplasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since it is not known whether aberrant GLI expression is similarly linked to developmental disorders, we developed gain-of-function transgenic mice which express human GLI ectopically. RESULTS: Affected transgenic mice exhibit a phenotype of failure to thrive, early death, and Hirschsprung-like patches of gastrointestinal dilatation. The colons of affected mice have greatly attenuated smooth muscle layers and abnormal overlying epithelium. The density of myenteric plexuses is reduced in the colonic walls. The severity of the phenotype is related to the level of transgene expression. CONCLUSIONS: The transgenic mouse model supports a role for GLI in gastrointestinal development. As part of the vertebrate hedgehog/patched signaling pathway, GLI is essential to mesoderm and CNS ectoderm development and transgenic GLI expression affects neuronal, muscular, and epithelial cell differentiation in the gut. Expression of human GLI in mice results in impairment of enteric neuronal development and a Hirschsprung-like phenotype...|$|R

In addition to GCPS, Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS; MIM 146510) and post-axial polydactyly type A (PAP-A; MIM 174200), two other disorders of human development, are caused by GLI 3 mutations. In order to gain more insight into the mutational spectrum associated with a single phenotype, we report here the extension of the GLI 3 mutation analysis to 24 new GCPS cases. We report the identification of 15 novel mutations present in one of the patient's GLI 3 alleles. The mutations map throughout the coding gene regions. The majority are truncating mutations (nine of 15) that engender prematurely terminated protein products mostly but not exclusively N-terminally to or within the central region encoding the DNA-binding domain. Two missense and two splicing mutations mapping within the zinc finger motifs presumably also interfere with DNA binding. The five mutations identified within the protein regions C-terminal to the zinc fingers putatively affect additional functional properties of GLI 3. In cell transfection experiments using fusions of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL 4 to different segments of GLI 3, transactivating capacity was assigned to two adjacent independent domains (TA 1 and TA 2) in the C-terminal third of GLI 3. Since these are the only functional domains affected by three C-terminally truncating mutations, we postulate that GCPS may be due either to haploinsufficiency resulting from the complete loss of one gene copy or to functional haploinsufficiency related to compromised properties of this transcription factor such as DNA binding and transactivatio...|$|R

Mutations in the human GLI 3 gene have been identified in <b>Greig</b> cepalopolysyndactyly, Pallister-Hall <b>syndrome</b> (PHS), and postaxial polydactyly type-A (PAP-A). We studied the involvement of GLI 3 in additional phenotypes of digital abnormalities in one family (UR 003) with preaxial polydactyly type-IV (PPD-IV), three families (UR 014, UR 015, and UR 016) with dominant PAP-A/B (with PPD-A and -B in the same family), and one family with PHS. Linkage analysis showed no recombination with GLI 3 -linked polymorphisms. Family UR 003 had a 1 -nt frameshift insertion, resulting in a truncated protein of 1, 245 amino acids. A frameshift mutation due to a 1 -nt deletion was found in family UR 014, resulting in a truncated protein of 1, 280 amino acids. Family UR 015 had a nonsense mutation, R 643 X, and family UR 016 had a missense mutation, G 727 R, in a highly conserved amino acid of domain 3. The patient with PHS had a nonsense mutation, E 1147 X. These results add two phenotypes to the phenotypic spectrum caused by GLI 3 mutations: the combined PAP-A/B and PPD-IV. These mutations do not support the suggested association between the mutations in GLI 3 and the resulting phenotypes.

40|$|Abstract The <b>Greig</b> cephalopolysyndactyly <b>syndrome</b> (GCPS) is a pleiotropic, {{multiple}} {{congenital anomaly}} syndrome. It is rare, but precise estimates of incidence {{are difficult to}} determine, as ascertainment is erratic (estimated range 1 – 9 / 1, 000, 000). The primary findings include hypertelorism, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, and polysyndactyly. The polydactyly is most commonly preaxial of the feet and postaxial in the hands, with variable cutaneous syndactyly, but the limb findings vary significantly. Other low frequency findings include central nervous system (CNS) anomalies, hernias, and cognitive impairment. GCPS is caused by loss of function mutations in the GLI 3 transcription factor gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The disorder is allelic to the Pallister-Hall syndrome and one form of the acrocallosal syndrome. Clinical diagnosis is challenging because the findings of GCPS are relatively non-specific, and no specific and sensitive clinical have been delineated. For this reason, we have proposed a combined clinical-molecular definition for the syndrome. A presumptive diagnosis of GCPS can be made if the patient has the classic triad of preaxial polydactyly with cutaneous syndactyly {{of at least one}} limb, hypertelorism, and macrocephaly. Patients with a phenotype consistent with GCPS (but which may not manifest all three attributes listed above) and a GLI 3 mutation may be diagnosed definitively with GCPS. In addition, persons with a GCPS-consistent phenotype who are related to a definitively diagnosed family member in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance may be diagnosed definitively as well. Antenatal molecular diagnosis is technically straightforward to perform. Differential diagnoses include preaxial polydactyly type 4, the GCPS contiguous gene syndrome, acrocallosal syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, and Teebi syndrome. Treatment of the disorder is symptomatic, with plastic or orthopedic surgery indicated for significant limb malformations. The prognosis for typically affected patients is excellent. There may be a slight increase in the incidence of developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Patients with large deletions that include GLI 3 may have a worse prognosis.
