25|$|The Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (A.E.G.) G.IV {{was derived}} from the earlier G.III. Designed as a {{tactical}} bomber, the relatively modern technology included onboard radios and electrically heated suits for the crew. Unlike the other German bombers such as the Gotha and the Friedrichshafen, the AEG featured an all-metal, welded-tube frame, making it a more rugged aircraft. Well equipped with armament, although the rear gunner’s cockpit was {{on the top of the}} fuselage, the position was equipped with a <b>hinged</b> <b>window</b> in the floor for viewing and fending off pursuing aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Seuss used a {{wide variety}} of media in his art. In keeping with the post-modernist tradition, Seuss is very {{experimental}} with his media; he even uses a <b>hinged</b> <b>window</b> frame and screen as a frame for one of his oil paintings.|$|E
50|$|Other cars, {{particularly}} older US-manufactured vans, have <b>hinged</b> <b>windows</b> with {{a folded}} lever mechanism to push {{and hold the}} window out from its closed position.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a simple}} {{rectangular}} planned timber framed and clad building with hipped corrugated iron roof. The building is slightly elevated from the ground on timber stumps with timber framed <b>hinged</b> <b>windows</b> lining each of the elevations. Adjoining the two shorter ends of the buildings are shorter hipped roof projections. The building is substantially intact.|$|R
50|$|In the southerly two of {{the three}} bays on the west (front) facade, the windows are set off by plain stone sills and lintels with black wooden {{louvered}} shutters. The wide frieze is topped with a dentil molding topped by bead and reel molding. Above the windows are grilles in the shape of Greek keys with <b>hinged</b> <b>windows</b> behind them.|$|R

50|$|About 10:15PM, while Mick {{was taking}} clean baby bottles to the {{maternity}} wing, 16-year-old Jennie McMinn, {{was able to}} force open and squeeze through a <b>hinged</b> <b>window</b> in her cell door. Then, using a spoon that she had smuggled from the cafeteria, she forced the lock on a second inmate's cell. The two of them waited while a third complained loudly about a water leak in her cell. As Mick was opening the third inmate's cell to investigate she was jumped from behind by the two lying in wait. She was beaten, throttled, and dragged to a small utility room and tied to pipes while unconscious. She was found dead {{the next morning when}} the next shift came on duty, still tied spread-eagle to the pipes. The official cause of death was ruled as assault.|$|E
50|$|The First White House of the Confederacy {{was a large}} two story {{wooden frame}} house painted white and green in Montgomery, Alabama. It had five bays across its frontal facade and four on either side. The main section of the house had a one-story wing {{extending}} from its rear, upon which two end-exterior chimneys were positioned. It was built on a foundation of brick piers and had a heavy bracketed cornice encircling the hipped roof. The cornice was unique in {{that it had a}} ventilation system ornamented with a Liberty cap design. A similar cornice could be found upon the rear one-story wing but with a flower design instead of the Liberty Cap one. The exterior walls are weather-boarded. The house had a portico in the center of its facade supported by fluted columns and a balustrade. In the portico area, the wall was built with wooden planks built to simulate a stone texture. The central entrance was framed with two pilasters with side lights. A transom built with an architrave was placed above the door. The central stairhall had access to a double parlor, two bedrooms, and a back hallway. The parlors had simple wooden doorways and were connected by sliding doors. The bedrooms were designed in a similar fashion. The hallway ended in an archway that was built with Greek revival doorways and an elaborate cornice design surrounding the roof of the doorway. The back hall which intersected with the main hallway had access to a side porch. The side porch was connected to the dining room through a <b>hinged</b> <b>window</b> that doubled as a door. The second floor had four bedrooms and what was most likely a nursery.|$|E
5000|$|An {{extensively}} molded surround {{frames the}} segmental arched main entrance. It has panelled reveals and a transom {{with a single}} light. The double doors have decorated panels below double-light <b>hinged</b> <b>windows.</b> [...] They open onto the original floor plan. A central hall with a stairway to the upper floors. On the east is a living room, with a dining room opposite, and {{the kitchen to the}} rear of that. Double doors at the south end lead to the rear veranda.|$|R
50|$|Many {{original}} features remain including oak {{doors and}} <b>hinges,</b> <b>window</b> shutters and fireplaces. Much of the timber framing is exposed throughout the house. Recent excavation and ground imaging uncovered a large Tudor kitchen underneath {{the house with}} a Tudor hearth and hood visible. Access to the cellar kitchen was by a staircase going north to south, which is now under the floor of the current kitchen. A file of text and images relating to the house is available in the Conservation Archive in Sutton Library.|$|R
25|$|In December, the Pemmican War {{returned}} to the Athabasca District. The NWC’s Alexander Stewart with 22 men seized the HBC’s Green Lake post and confiscated 11-1/2 packs of furs, 1,500lbs of dried meat, 3 bags of pemmican and all the post’s trade goods. They then dismantled the post and carried off the doors, <b>hinges,</b> <b>windows</b> & other useful materials. That winter, Archibald Norman McLeod attempted to starve the HBC posts in Athabasca by preventing their Indian hunters from entering any HBC posts and bribing others to switch sides.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental work on active control of sound transmission through a restricted opening bottom <b>hinged</b> <b>window.</b> The main {{goal of the}} work is to demonstrate the feasibility of the active technique to limit the loss of attenuation due to the aperture of windows, and its application to aircraft fly-over incident noise. The experimental window is placed in an exposed façade of a dwelling close to an airport and subject to fly-by aircraft noise. The active control is configured to cancel the pressure at the aperture using a single-input single-output feedforward adaptive system. As a result, a reduction of sound transmission is achieved with low power consumption. In global terms, an increase of almost 3 dB of transmission loss (with respect to the partially opened window insulation values) in the low frequency range (below 160 Hz and according to the National Danish Method for evaluating low frequency noise) is demonstrated, which is equivalent to a reduction of 50 % in the loss of insulation caused by opening the window. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|One website reviews Franklin Mint {{vehicles}} {{and points out}} that though {{the lines of the}} 1:24 scale 1948 Tucker were [...] "clean and precise" [...] the model suffered from unrealistically thick <b>hinges,</b> <b>window</b> plastic 'glass' correctly detailed in some places but not in others, and a misplaced steering wheel and other problems with interior rendering (JSS Software 2012). Hemmings Motor News reported that the Franklin rendition of the Mercedes 300SL had accurate interior upholstery and nicely fitting gulling doors, but color details that were wrong, parts badly placed, and a misshapen windshield. (LaChance 2007).|$|R
50|$|The front {{verandah}} {{has been}} enclosed with timber louvres {{and the original}} dowel balustrading is covered by fibrous cement panels. The original square verandah posts with tapered chamfers, have simple capital and astragal embellishments, and are visible in the front facade. Entry to the front verandah is gained via a short flight of later concrete stairs and through a single lattice door. A flying gable above the entry has decorative fretwork fronted by a simple slat infill and bargeboard. The side verandahs have also been enclosed with <b>hinged</b> <b>windows.</b> The formerly exposed face of the eastern gable, now hidden by the side verandah in-fill, has 8 inch deep chamferboards, {{which may have been}} recycled from elsewhere in the house.|$|R

50|$|The {{incident}} temporarily {{shut down}} the entire refinery and caused oil prices to increase. Damage was caused to the nearby villages of North and South Killingholme {{as well as the}} nearby town of Immingham - mainly doors being blown from their <b>hinges</b> and <b>windows</b> being blown in.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between grave shelters and grave houses. Shelters, common in Protestant southern cemeteries, are primarily built with a roof, four corner posts and a fence protecting an in-ground burial site. Grave houses are complete, miniature houses with siding, <b>hinged</b> doors, <b>windows</b> and sometimes ornate interiors.|$|R
50|$|Casement <b>windows</b> are <b>hinged</b> on {{one side}} and are {{typically}} operated using an interior hand crank. Awning and Basement <b>windows</b> <b>hinge</b> on top and bottom respectively.|$|R
50|$|The damage {{reached a}} radius {{of up to}} 10 miles (16 km), {{including}} shattered windows, doors blown off their <b>hinges,</b> cracked <b>windows</b> and injuries from flying glass and debris. At McCarran International Airport, seven miles (11 km) away in Las Vegas, windows were cracked and doors were pushed open. The shock wave buffeted a Boeing 737 on final approach.|$|R
50|$|The {{cabin is}} {{constructed}} from spruce logs interspersed with chinking {{sitting on a}} rubble fieldstone and granite rock foundation. The roof is covered with asphalt shingling, with eaves overhanging the cabin walls below. All windows are triple casement, with the center <b>window</b> <b>hinged.</b>|$|R
50|$|A row of {{horizontally}} <b>hinged</b> timber framed <b>windows</b> opens {{from the}} long eastern elevation. A short ramp running parallel {{to the side of}} the building leads to a double timber door located approximately in the middle of the elevation. A metal hood shades this door.|$|R
50|$|Three basic {{versions}} were produced;MkI, had {{a separate}} internal roll cage, long nose, <b>windows</b> <b>hinged</b> {{at the front}} edge. Both bonnet and boot lids had ribbed sections, boot lid ribs could be opened up as louvers for better air flow for the VW engine if desired.MkII went through the most changes it has a shorter removable nose section, built in roll cage on later models {{and the addition of}} a Ford-based model, longer side <b>windows</b> <b>hinged</b> from front bottom and top corners. Ford versions had the bump on the bonnet to accommodate the engine and later version had smooth boot lids with the ribs removed.MkIII, back to one piece nose, slightly higher roof, both versions now had built in steel bars to the cabin area. Side windows as MkII.|$|R
5000|$|A {{casement}} is {{a window}} that is attached to its frame {{by one or more}} <b>hinges.</b> Casement <b>windows</b> are <b>hinged</b> at the side. They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame, in which case they are hinged on the outside. Casement windows are often held open using a casement stay. <b>Windows</b> <b>hinged</b> at the top are referred to as awning <b>windows,</b> and ones <b>hinged</b> at the bottom are called hoppers.In the UK, casement windows were common before the sash window was introduced, and usually metal with leaded glass—glass panes held in place with strips of lead (called lead [...] "cames"; leaded glass is {{not to be confused with}} lead glass, which refers to the manufacture of the glass itself). These casement <b>windows</b> usually were <b>hinged</b> on the side, and opened inward. By the start of the Victorian era, opening casements and frames were constructed from timber in their entirety. The windows were covered by functional exterior shutters, which opened outward. Variants of casement windows are still the norm in many European countries.|$|R
50|$|The facades have no steady contours. In {{the spirit}} of the Gothic style, it is {{dominated}} by the split form, which doesn't leave any larger surfaces, but instead surrounds the whole structure with alternating with abutments and <b>window</b> <b>hinges.</b> The roofs are covered with different coloured glazed tiles that build small diamond patterns.|$|R
50|$|Architectural Ironmongery or (Architectural Hardware) is a {{term used}} for the {{manufacture}} and wholesale distributor of items made from iron, steel, brass, aluminium or other metals, including plastics, for use in all types of buildings. The Architectural Ironmongery range includes door handles, closers, locks, cylinder pulls and <b>hinges</b> ("door furniture"), <b>window</b> fittings, cupboard fittings, iron railings, handrails, balustrades, switches and sockets.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a {{modified}} 203 which now featured <b>hinged</b> quarter light <b>windows</b> [...] {{on the front}} ends of the front doors and an enlarged rear window on the saloon versions. [...] This upgrade also saw {{the removal of the}} speedometer from the centre of the dashboard to a position directly ahead of the driver.|$|R
50|$|Little of the {{original}} house remained after a fire in 1896. The traditional thatched roof was replaced by sturdier Welsh slates. Rhodes gave no strict instructions as to what he wanted from Baker. Rhodes abhorred any mechanically made items (such as <b>hinges</b> for <b>windows)</b> {{in the house and}} set out to remove them and have them replaced with brass and bronze items that would be cast. Baker replaced the front of the house, added a long stoep in the back and constructed a new wing. The wing contained a billiard room and master bedroom above on the second floor that contained a large bay window overlooking Devil's Peak. He also added a grand hall with a massive fireplace.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has carpeting on the floor, {{standard on}} all versions, cloth upholstery on the seats and top-range versions featured Alcantara upholstery on the dashboard, seats and door panels, and options such as electric windows, central locking, split rear bench seat, rear <b>window</b> <b>hinged</b> electrically (revolutionary solution at the times), glass sunroof and {{climate control system}} with electronic controls and LED display, similar to that already adopted on Fiat Regata.|$|R

5000|$|The D3 {{was little}} {{changed from the}} D2 under the skin, but the [...] "skin" [...] was an all new ponton format body with doors. The {{headlamps}} still stood out from the body, which presumably was a less costly solution than integrating them to the wings. The extra weight of doors and <b>hinges</b> and additional <b>window</b> did add some penalty and the car now weighted 380 kg. Nevertheless, a maximum speed of 75 km/h (47 mph) was claimed.|$|R
50|$|The Series 1 car {{changed little}} during its lifetime. However, in May 1973 saloons became {{available}} in both standard and deluxe versions. In 1975 the 127 Special variant was released which featured a restyled front grille and detail {{changes to the}} interior. The deluxe version was differentiated by its reclining front seats and opening <b>hinged</b> rear side <b>windows</b> as standard equipment. During {{the next couple of}} years the Fiat 850, which had initially been marketed alongside the 127, was withdrawn from most markets.|$|R
50|$|Items {{that could}} not be made on the grounds were sent for from the East. These {{included}} glass for the <b>windows,</b> <b>hinges,</b> and nails. The cement used between the blocks was of lime mortar and sand. The stones were placed in a “length-wise and width-wise alternately… Flemish bond pattern.” The roof was originally smooth-pine shingles, and a white fence surrounded the house, with a concrete horse-mounting block at the entrance.The fence is original to the house, with the exception of timely maintenance.|$|R
