5|$|Betty {{is shown}} enjoying {{her new life}} in London and she later runs into Daniel in Trafalgar Square. They talk and Daniel apologizes for not saying goodbye, before asking Betty out to dinner. Betty then jokingly asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{something}} to do, she {{is looking for a}} new assistant and Daniel tells her that he might submit his resume. As Betty then heads off to work across Trafalgar Square, the series title is superimposed onto the scene; after a moment, Ugly disappears.|$|E
25|$|A rescue tether {{is a short}} {{length of}} rope or webbing with a clip at one or both ends, which the {{stand-by}} diver uses to clip the unresponsive diver to his harness to free up both hands during a recovery. This can be useful <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to climb a structure, shotline or topographical feature, and the umbilicals can not be safely used to lift the divers due to snags or sharp edges.|$|E
25|$|Some {{classical}} and modern scholars have analyzed Abraham's reasoning for hiding Sarah's position as his wife. Rashi argued {{that when a}} stranger comes to town, the proper thing {{to do would be}} to inquire <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham {{to the fact that there}} is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, comparable to Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery.|$|E

25|$|It's {{revealed}} that four days earlier, Jack West {{escaped from the}} Pit in the Ethiopian mine, rescued Pooh Bear from sacrifice and freed the Jewish slave-miners. In gratitude, the miners give him the sacred stones that Wolf had been using them to dig for - the Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, which contain the final incantation to activate the Machine when all the pillars are placed. Jack and Pooh travel to their old farm in Kenya, finding Horus (Jack's falcon) and the Adamson twins waiting; they'd come to the farm because {{it seemed like the}} best isolated safe place. They share with Jack the news that the Brotherhood has a mole in Wolf's unit, a marine code-named Switchblade, who plans to sabotage Wolf's effort to place the Second Pillar. Jack and the Adamsons head to Zanzibar, where an old friend of Jack's is hiding out, making a career after deserting the US army to attack gun-runners in Africa. Pooh leaves them at the airport to go north and rescue Stretch from the Mossad's torture chambers. Before he leaves, Jack gives him a GPS locator with which to signal Jack <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> help.|$|E
500|$|... "The Harrowing" [...] is {{the sixth}} and final episode of the first series of British dark comedy {{anthology}} series Inside No. 9. It aired on 12 March 2014 on BBC Two. The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and stars Shearsmith, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Helen McCrory, Poppy Rush and Sean Buckley. While comedic in places, [...] "The Harrowing" [...] makes extensive use of gothic horror elements transmuted into a modern context. The plot follows Katy (Edwards), who has been hired to housesit for eccentric siblings Hector (Shearsmith) and Tabitha (McCrory). They rarely leave the house, but have an event to attend. They tell Katy about their bedridden, disabled brother Andras (Buckley), who cannot speak but will ring a bell <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> assistance. Katy is joined by her friend Shell (Rush) once Hector and Tabitha leave, and, upon hearing Andras's bell, the pair reluctantly head upstairs. The episode takes place in Hector and Tabitha's mansion, which is kept deliberately cold and filled with paintings depicting Hell. The writers experimented {{with a variety of}} possible endings, hoping to make the episode's close both interesting and scary.|$|E
500|$|... is {{the partner}} of Hidan {{and a former}} ninja of Takigakure, the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. Kakuzu is {{motivated}} by greed and joins the Akatsuki to seek out valuable bounties. However, his extreme temperament led Kakuzu to dislike having a partner and eventually killing whomever he is partnered with {{in a fit of}} rage, being paired up with the immortal Hidan as a result. When Kakuzu was still living in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage, but the mission has failed. Defeated and humiliated, Kakuzu returned to his village, where he received a lot of hard punishments. Feeling a great hatred for their fellow village, Kakuzu escape from prison and stole the forbidden techniques of his village, becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed {{of a large number of}} black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, being his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use and integrates their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a replacement heart. Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi. After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu's Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.|$|E
