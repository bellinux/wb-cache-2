25|$|Dances & Marches for the Orphan Age {{was created}} {{over a period}} of seven years. The {{preference}} of uneven or incomplete rhythms is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b> The dominant female melodic vocals assumes a distinctly sorrowful voice, sometimes non-verbal with a transcendental character, and the most important instrument here, not by its predominance, but by its content, is the organ, which has the role of disquieting and dramatizing the figurative, fierily symbolism of Saivon's lyrics. The album was released after extensive remixes by Vladimír Hirsch in March 2005 by the Portugal label Dagaz Music.|$|E
500|$|Venus [...] "overtakes" [...] Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun. As it does so, {{it changes}} from the [...] "Evening Star", visible after sunset, to the [...] "Morning Star", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other {{inferior}} planet, {{reaches a maximum}} elongation of only 28° and {{is often difficult to}} discern in twilight, Venus is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> when it is at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported [...] "unidentified flying object".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from fans and television critics. It was named by Vanity Fairs John Ortved as the show's fifth best episode. Ortved said, [...] "While the Simpsons {{people have always}} claimed evenhandedness in their satire, the show is, after all, hardly right-leaning, and it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> how gleefully the former President is mocked here." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, wrote: [...] "Very strange, this episode takes The Simpsons into a whole new dimension of political satire. The lampooning of a single public figure is a startling move. Works much better for Americans, we're told." ...|$|E

He {{knew that}} Grayson would be angry if {{he let the}} boss's {{daughter}} into that back room alone with an outlaw and a robber, and the boss himself would probably be inclined to have Eddie drawn and quartered; but it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>Miss</b> Barbara anything.|$|R

At the same time--" ...|$|R
500|$|Chris Kelly of Fact said, [...] "By {{embracing}} the codeine-weed-molly trifecta, hashtag-friendly hooks, and — perhaps most significantly — ascendant producers, the 38-year-old rapper has maintained rap relevance, even as {{that has become}} more difficult than ever." [...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, [...] "For all its vulgarity, predictability, repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs, Juicy J's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit." [...] Julia LeConte of Now said, [...] "The whole thing isn't about disrespecting women, though. Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple-pleasure narratives: popping molly, making money. On his third solo record, the Three 6 Mafia rapper signed to Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang is 'getting high like he's 18.' At 38, though, it's not super-amusing, like J is the hip-hop Peter Pan refusing to grow up among a crew of younger emcees." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated, [...] "Stay Trippy can be musically compelling. Granted, the words are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b> [...] "Stay motivated, stay high, stay hustling, (forget) everything else," [...] he intones on [...] "So Much Money", a title that sums up the highest virtue in J's world." [...] David [...] "Rek" [...] Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word. Then there are songs that {{are meant to be}} played loud in public settings, and the lyrics don't matter so much. If you haven't already figured it out, Stay Trippy is the latter. And for as much flack as it receives, there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the 'trippy' lifestyle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{completion}} {{the entire}} bunker {{was to be}} covered with soil and planted over with trees and bushes, but considering {{the scale of the}} project it was hardly possible to effectively camouflage it from aerial reconnaissance during the construction process. Efforts to that effect were therefore not especially thorough. Indeed, the site was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss,</b> and the USAF took several aerial photos of it in February 1945 during reconnaissance prior to the bombardment of the airfield at Mettenheim and the train yard at Mühldorf. The site was discovered upon examination of the photos, as an overhead view of main bunker drawn in March 1945 and labeled [...] "MUHLDORF (GERMANY) SEMI-BURIED INSTALLATION" [...] attests. The site was never bombed, however. The reasons why are unclear. One reason could be that the existence of the work camp was known and that the Allies did not want to risk bombing it by accident. It may also have been known that its completion was unlikely and thus other targets presented a higher priority.|$|E
60|$|It {{certainly}} was not shared by the children. Sisters unseen for three years could hardly be very prominent in their minds. Fergus hoped that they would ride to the wedding upon elephants, and Valetta thought it very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> the being a bridesmaid, when Kitty Varley had already enjoyed the honour. However, she soon began to glorify herself on the beauty of Alethea's future title.|$|E

60|$|Somehow, {{it seemed}} {{impossible}} {{to think of}} lovers in connection with Miss Emily. She was short and stout and pudgy, with a face so round and fat and red that it seemed quite featureless; {{and her hair was}} scanty and gray. She walked with a waddle, just like Mrs. Rachel Lynde, and she was always rather short of breath. It was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>Miss</b> Emily had ever been young; yet old Mr. Murray, who lived next door to the Leiths, not only expected us to believe it, but assured us that she had been very pretty.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Reuse {{distance}} {{analysis is}} a runtime approach {{that has been}} widely used to accurately model the memory system behavior of applications. However, traditional reuse distance analysis algorithms use tree-based data structures and are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> parallelize, <b>missing</b> the tremendous computing power of modern architectures such as the emerging GPUs. This paper presents a highly-parallel reuse distance analysis algorithm (HP-RDA) to speedup the process using the SPMD execution model of GPUs. In particular, we propose a hybrid data structure of hash table and local arrays to flatten the traditional tree representation of memory access traces. Further, we use a probabilistic model to correct any loss of precision from a straightforward parallelization of the original sequential algorithm. Our experimental results show that using an NVIDIA GPU, our algorithm achieves a factor of 20 speedu...|$|R
60|$|I tried <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> throw <b>Miss</b> Thorn {{out of my}} thoughts, {{and very}} nearly succeeded. I took to {{spending}} {{more and more of}} my time at the county-seat, where I remained for days at a stretch, inventing business when there was none. And in the meanwhile I lost all respect for myself as a sensible man, and cursed the day the Celebrity came into the state. It seemed strange that this acquaintance of my early days should have come back into my life, transformed, to make it more or less miserable. The county-seat being several miles inland, and lying in the midst of hills, could get intolerably hot in September. At last I was driven out in spite of myself, and I arrived at Asquith cross and dusty. As Simpson was brushing me off, Miss Trevor came up the path looking cool and pretty in a summer gown, and her face expressed sympathy. I have never denied that sympathy was a good thing.|$|R

5000|$|Billboard {{magazine}} {{gave the}} song a positive review:"Although It's All About Me {{can be too}} repetitive and thus unnecessarily tiring at times, it does have an interesting, catchy rhythm that's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b> Undoubtedly, R&B listeners will find this highly appealing. The vocals have a great range, {{as well as a}} smooth, angelic tone. It's worth giving it a try." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the general}} basis, Monroe and Olivier did receive {{particular}} praise for their performances; however, not all reviews were kind to their work. One review stated that [...] "Sir Laurence is kept {{pretty much a}} stuffed-shirt, wearing a monocle and speaking in Teutonic accents that are unpleasant and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> understand. And <b>Miss</b> Monroe mainly has to giggle, wiggle, breathe deeply and flirt. She {{does not make the}} showgirl a person, simply another of her pretty oddities." [...] Other critics noted Monroe and Olivier's lack of on-screen chemistry, while other reviews praised it. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a [...] "fresh" [...] rating of 86%.|$|R

On 9 September 2014, Puerto Rican newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, and Venezuelan newspaper, El Nacional, each printed an article that said that the contestants would be staying at a Trump-owned hotel in Miami; further fueling rumors that the pageant would be held in Miami in December.|$|R
60|$|These {{feelings}} might partly {{arise from}} its having been only now that, {{had all been}} well, {{he could have been}} with Amabel; so that it seemed as if he had never hitherto appreciated the loss. He had at first comforted himself by thinking it was better to be without her than to cause her distress; but now he found how <b>hard</b> it was <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> her--his bright angel. Darkness was closing on him; a tedious, aimless life spread out before him; a despair of doing good haunted him, and with it a sense of something like the presence of an evil spirit, triumphing in his having once put himself within its grasp.|$|R
5000|$|The Melbourne Exhibition Centre {{was to be}} built {{larger than}} the Sydney Exhibition Building while still costing the same.

The site is adjacent the Bali Governor’s office, and is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> with its grand structure that resembles a Balinese Hindu priest’s praying bell, or ‘bajra’. Inside the base is a museum that displays various historical dioramas of the people’s past struggle for ndependence.|$|E

In some places there are many different knitting groups that never interact with each other, on Knit in Public Day they come together in one place, making them <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not accuse John Simcoe of this crime, but I need hardly {{say that}} the mere {{possibility}} {{of such a thing}} heightened the strong feeling entertained by Miss Covington that Simcoe was the author of the abduction of Walter Rivington. She and her devoted friend, Miss Purcell, pursued their investigations with unflagging energy. They suspected that the man who was very intimate with Simcoe had acted as his agent in the matter, and a casual remark which was overheard in a singular manner, which will be explained when the case goes into another court, that this man was going to Tilbury, gave them a clew. Then, in a manner which many persons might find it very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> believe, <b>Miss</b> Covington learned from a conversation between the two men, when together in a box at Her Majesty's Theater, that the lad was in charge of a bargeman living near the little village of Pitsea, in Essex. From that place, my lord, he was brought last week, and Miss Covington will produce him in court, if your lordship wishes to see him. Thus, then, it is immaterial to us whether your lordship pronounces for the first or second will.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Martha did not. She merely {{said in her}} fretful mumbling way, [...] "What foolishness are you young rips up to now?" [...] {{and thought}} no more about it. Mr. Meredith had gone away {{early in the morning}} before any one was up. He went without his breakfast, too, but that was, of course, of common occurrence. Half of the time he forgot it {{and there was no one}} to remind him of it. Breakfast--Aunt Martha's breakfast--was not a <b>hard</b> meal <b>to</b> <b>miss.</b> Even the hungry [...] "young rips" [...] did not feel it any great {{deprivation}} to abstain from the [...] "lumpy porridge and blue milk" [...] which had aroused the scorn of Mary Vance. But it was different at dinner time. They were furiously hungry then, and the odor of roast beef which pervaded the manse, and which was wholly delightful in spite of the fact that the roast beef was badly underdone, was almost more than they could stand. In desperation they rushed to the graveyard where they couldn't smell it. But Una could not keep her eyes from the dining room window, through which the Upper Lowbridge minister could be seen, placidly eating.|$|R
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Hands All Over" [...] is [...] "the one real gamble"; {{despite the fact}} that it tries <b>to</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find a <b>missing</b> connection between the works of Prince, Queen and Nine Inch Nails, [...] "it's certainly one of the more interesting things the band has ever recorded." [...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|R

60|$|The reader {{may find}} it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> follow <b>Miss</b> Baker's mind {{on the subject of}} this engagement. Some time since she was giving advice that it should be broken off, and now she was au désespoir because that result had been reached. She had one of those minds that are prone to veering, and which show by the way they turn, not any {{volition}} of their own, but the direction of some external wind, some external volition. Nor can one be angry with, or despise Miss Baker for this weathercock aptitude. She was the least selfish of human beings, the least opinionative, the most good-natured. She had had her hot fits and her cold fits with regard to Bertram; but her hot fits and her cold had all been hot or cold with reference to what she conceived to be her niece's chances of happiness. Latterly, she had fancied that Caroline did love Bertram too well to give him up; and circumstances had led her to believe more strongly than ever that old Mr. Bertram wished the marriage, and that the two together, if married, would certainly inherit his wealth. So latterly, during the last month or so, Miss Baker had blown very hot.|$|R
