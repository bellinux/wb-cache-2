50|$|For some bridges, <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> {{were added}} {{after the first}} bridge had been constructed, often after initial flooding.|$|R
50|$|Two {{supplemental}} arches, {{of similar}} cast iron construction, carry a towpath {{on the south}} bank and also act as <b>flood</b> <b>arches.</b> A stone arch carries a small path on the north, town, bank.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{comprises}} {{three small}} skew arches, with a causeway either side with <b>flood</b> <b>arches.</b> The river this far is navigable from Lechlade for rowing boats but {{the bridge is}} very difficult to negotiate as the stream here is fast and shallow.|$|R
50|$|The space {{beneath a}} <b>flood</b> <b>arch</b> is {{normally}} dry and often carries a towpath or similar. In {{some cases it}} borders on the shallow edge of a river, {{but this does not}} carry substantial flow in normal conditions. A bridge with multiple arches across a flowing river would instead be termed a viaduct.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{segmental}} arches of red sandstone ashlar masonry. The central arch is larger, {{one of the}} flanking arches is dry and forms a <b>flood</b> <b>arch.</b> Flooding is a problem on this river and the spandrels are pierced by three large circular tunnels. A further tunnel in the abutments gives additional flood protection and also acts as a cattle creep.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridge is}} made of [...] "squared and tooled {{sandstone}} blocks with ashlar dressings". A circular oculus in the spandrel above each pier is filled in with whinstone rubble. The five main arches each have an arch band and a triple keystone; the arches grow larger and higher towards the bridge's centre. There is a smaller semicircular <b>flood</b> <b>arch</b> at either end, with pendent keystones. A weir named the Cauld immediately downstream of the bridge has protected it from erosion since 1785.|$|E
50|$|Combe Bridge is a stone {{bridge on}} the minor road linking the village with Long Hanborough. It spans the Evenlode wnere the river forms the {{boundary}} with Hanborough parish. The bridge was rebuilt in the 18th century with two arches {{for the river}} and <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> either side.|$|R
50|$|Lashbrook Viaduct was 270 feet in length; it was {{replaced}} {{at the same}} time as the Thames bridge. Wargrave <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> consisted of seven 10ft spans; also replaced in 1895 - 1898; it was then constructed with three brick spans and from that time became known as Wargrave viaduct.|$|R
50|$|Bewdley Bridge is a three-span masonry {{arch bridge}} over the River Severn at Bewdley, Worcestershire. The two side spans are each 52 ft, with the central span 60 ft. The central arch rises 18 ft. Smaller <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> on the bank bridge the towpath. The bridge is 27 ft wide.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1339 by Monks from St Werburgh's Abbey Chester. It {{originally}} had ten arches with a large gate tower on the fifth arch. In 1770 the tower was demolished and at some time two of the arches on the Welsh side were lost. [...] The bridge is a narrow structure built of red sandstone with eight arches, of which five are over the river. On the Farndon side is one <b>flood</b> <b>arch</b> and two flood arches are on the Holt side.|$|E
50|$|Tullibody Old Bridge {{was built}} {{early in the}} 16th century, {{constructed}} of rubble with some ashlar and was designed to impede the rapid transit of horse traffic. The plan shows two opposed bends.With two main <b>arches</b> and three <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> to the west, its great length (442 ft or 134.7m) probably reflects the difficulty in crossing the flood plain at this point.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} opened in 1838. It was built {{at a cost}} of £15,000, which was paid by the local {{landowner}} T W Beaumont. The designer was the architect George Basevi. [...] The bridge joins Bywell and the adjoining roads with Stocksfield. It is of ashlar masonry, with five segmental arches crossing the river, and two <b>flood</b> <b>arches,</b> without parapets, to the south.|$|R
5000|$|The stone {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to have been built around 1425 with five-spans. It is not known who designed and built the bridge. The five-span structure had three river <b>arches</b> and smaller <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> on each bank. On 21 August 1775, the western pier had been demolished due to a flood, which partially destroyed two arches on that side of the bridge. The arches were then rebuilt as a single arch of double span.|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{structure}} is surrounded by thick vegetation, and serves only to carry a wood shed. The bridge has a span of 6 m, a width of 3.3 m and is built of travertine. The walls of one ramp feature two <b>flood</b> <b>arches,</b> one of which has a segmental shape and runs from the ground to the quarter point of the main arch rib. A similar segmental relieving arch {{can be found at}} another Roman bridge in central Italy, the Ponte di Pioraco.|$|R
25|$|Work {{began on}} 30 July 1792. The River Leen {{ran along the}} {{southern}} edge of the city between Lenton in the west and Leen Bridge, a series of <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> to the east. The river bed was enlarged to form the canal, while the river was diverted into a new covered channel further to the north. The <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> were replaced by a new bridge, and the canal turned sharply to the south, to join the Trent. The proprietors wanted a basin where the canal joined the river, with a lock above that, but Jessop argued that such an arrangement would lead to the entrance becoming blocked with sand. Building the lock close to the river would ensure that the sand was flushed away whenever the lock was emptied. The town section was officially opened on 30 July 1793, giving access to wharves, although there was still much work to be completed. To the east of Leen Bridge, a weir was constructed, to feed water into the Brewery Arm, an enlargement of the river channel. At its far end, another weir overflowed back into the new course of the Leen. A second arm, the Poplar Arm, was made using water channels on Eastcroft Meadow, and joined the Brewery Arm.|$|R
5000|$|The elegant {{cast iron}} road bridge {{was built in}} 1827 {{as part of the}} new turnpike road {{constructed}} up {{the lower part of the}} Wye valley between Chepstow and Monmouth. The bridge connects the English and Welsh sides of the river, with an abandoned but recently restored toll house on the Welsh side. [...] The bridge comprises a single arch of 50 m , and was designed by Charles Hollis of London and cast at Merthyr Tydfil. A pair of stone <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> were added at each end some years later, doubling the length of the bridge. Because of its narrow width, modern traffic using the A466 is controlled by traffic signals at either end.|$|R
50|$|Trimmu Barrage was {{constructed}} between 1937 and 1939 by English engineer. Its name was changed later. {{primarily as a}} flood control mechanism to protect the city of Jhang from <b>floods.</b> The <b>arched</b> grid iron's bridge section is integrated with several protective bands.|$|R
5000|$|In the Domesday account Bubwith {{is written}} as [...] "Bubuid". Before the Conquest, lordship {{was held by}} Alwin and Ketil; after, Gilbert Tison became Tenant-in-chief. Though {{there has been a}} {{recorded}} river crossing since at least the year 1200, the present bridge over the Derwent, consisting of three limestone <b>arches</b> and several <b>flood</b> <b>arches,</b> replaced a [...] "dangerous and inconvenient" [...] ferry service when it was built in 1798. Crossing the bridge required a toll until 1936, with the original costs amounting to three shilling for six horses, and 10 pence for twenty head of oxen. Certain vehicles, such as funeral processions, were exempt from the toll.The railways reached the village in 1848, and Bubwith had its own station on the Selby to Driffield Line. It closed to passengers in 1954.|$|R
50|$|During his tenure, Browning {{established}} the Consumer Protection Division and reviewed and revised environmental {{and natural resources}} laws, rules and regulations. Also during his tenure, West Virginia sued the Pittston Coal Company for $100 million in damages for the February 26, 1972 Buffalo Creek <b>Flood.</b> Governor <b>Arch</b> A. Moore Jr. later settled the suit for $1 million.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{regulator}} to {{be installed}} was at Woodhouse Mill. It is a vertical sluice gate, and is situated at the downstream end of the Woodhouse Mill washlands nature reserve. A railway embankment crosses the nature reserve, and <b>flood</b> <b>arches</b> allow the water to flood {{both sides of the}} tracks. There are no floodbanks between the river and the reserve, which results in it flooding soon after the gate is closed. The mechanism here was manufactured by Ransomes and Rapier in 1956, and the regulator was commissioned in 1959. The Canklow regulator, situated close to the A630 link road from junction 33 on the M1 motorway, is also a vertical sluice gate, which when closed causes progressive flooding of seven washland areas {{on both sides of the}} M1, capable of holding [...] of flood water. It was installed in 1969 as part of a major road-building project, which saw the M1 motorway and the A630 road built across the washlands.|$|R
50|$|Wetherby Bridge {{is around}} {{a hundred yards}} {{downstream}} from Wetherby Weir. When the Wharfe rises the adjacent car park and low-lying land at the Wilderness <b>flood.</b> The bridge's <b>arches</b> {{can act as a}} barrier collecting debris and driftwood that can cause problems after the river level subsides.|$|R
5000|$|In 1802 {{the first}} arch at the Skerton (northern) end was {{demolished}} {{to allow the}} passage of ships, including ships built upstream of the bridge at Brockbank's shipyard. A second arch fell down in 1807 {{as a result of}} <b>floods.</b> The third <b>arch</b> gave way in 1814 and the remaining pier, although shored up, collapsed into the river in 1845.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>floods</b> the central <b>arch</b> of Workington (or Calva Bridge) (built 1840) was left unsound and ready to collapse. As a Grade II listed structure, the bridge was {{analysed}} by structural experts after the floods, with the aim of being able to repair and reopen the bridge. Workington Bridge reopened to pedestrians on 11 February 2011, Now the bridge is open to vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The first {{reference}} to a bridge across the Thames between Wallingford and Crowmarsh Gifford is from 1141, when King Stephen besieged Wallingford Castle. The first stone bridge is credited to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, and four remaining arches are believed to contain 13th century elements. Major repairs used stone from the dissolved Holy Trinity Priory in 1530. Four arches were removed so a drawbridge could be inserted during the siege of the castle in the Civil War of 1646, and these were replaced with timber structures until repair in 1751. Following a <b>flood,</b> three <b>arches</b> were rebuilt by Richard Clarke from 1810-1812 to a design by John Treacher (1760-1836) developed in 1809, and a parapet and balustrade added.|$|R
5000|$|According to British Columbia's Geographical Names Information System, {{the word}} [...] "Moyie" [...] is a {{corruption}} of the French [...] "mouiller" [...] or [...] "mouillé", a name given by fur trappers referring to the wet conditions, also described by David Thompson in 1808. Thompson called the river [...] "McDonald's River". Governor Simpson called it [...] "Grand Quête River". Captain Palliser called it [...] "Choe-coos River". The name [...] "Moyie" [...] was originally pronounced [...] "moo-YAY", indicating its French origin, but today is commonly pronounced [...] "moy-EE". In 1923 the Eileen dam (previously known as the Moyie dam) was constructed where Skin Creek enters the river about five miles upstream of Moyie Falls. It was anchored to a weak rock structure which washed away in 1925 due to <b>flooding.</b> The <b>arch</b> still remains intact.|$|R
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1771 and Taylor's {{design was}} built by John Townsend of Oxford (builder of Swinford Bridge) at a total cost of £19,000 (equivalent to £ today). Works were delayed until a temporary ferry had been constructed and the foundation stone was laid by the Mayor of Maidenhead on 19 October 1772. After delays caused by ice, frost and <b>flooding</b> the centre <b>arch</b> was completed in 1775. The new bridge was finished and finally opened for traffic in 1777.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the success}} of the first hotel, Heathman {{immediately}} started work on a sister hotel a block away. The New Heathman Hotel was completed in 1927. It was a 10-story concrete structure faced with brick. The decorative details were designed in the Jacobean Revival style by the Portland architectural firm of DeYoung and Roald. The second story and upper-floor windows were trimmed in stone, and the lobby's dark-hued paneling extended to the mezzanine, where light <b>flooded</b> through tall, <b>arched</b> windows. Acanthus leaves decorated the mezzanine's plaster columns and ceiling trim. The hotel's entrance was on the Salmon Street side (where it remained until 1984).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the latest developments}} in the MARS System of strengthening and therefore preserving masonry <b>arches.</b> Recent <b>floods</b> in Cumbria and other locations in the UK have highlighted the vulnerability of masonry bridges to the effects of hydrodynamic forces yet design and assessment codes pay little regard to the effects of these forces. This paper evaluates hydrodynamic and other forces associated with <b>flooding</b> on masonry <b>arch</b> bridges and examines means of strengthening against these forces as well as giving enhanced traffic capacity. It is suggested that assessment and design codes need to be rewritten {{to take into account the}} effects of flood waters...|$|R

500|$|The River Weaver is {{more than}} [...] long. From its source {{in the hills of}} west Cheshire just south of Peckforton Castle, and within a few hundred metres of the source of the River Gowy it {{initially}} flows in a south-easterly direction towards the border with Shropshire, fed by tributaries some of which rise in north Shropshire. The first of three canal crossings occurs just before the village of Wrenbury, when the Llangollen Canal crosses its course. After flowing through the village, it passes {{to the west of the}} Cheshire village of Audlem, where it starts to flow approximately northwards across the Cheshire Plain. Shortly afterwards, the Shropshire Union Canal is carried over it on Moss Hall aqueduct. The first significant town on the river is the market town of Nantwich, where a watermill was a feature from the 13th century; 100m further north, an early 19th-century stone bridge, with a single span, crosses the river. Continuing northwards, it passes under the Middlewich Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal before the village of Church Minshull. The aqueduct carrying the canal was designed by Thomas Telford and was built of brick with stone bands between 1827 and 1833. The river flows through a central arch, and there are <b>flood</b> relief <b>arches</b> on each side of the channel. [...] The two waterways run roughly parallel for several miles. They diverge near Winsford, the current head of navigation, and at Northwich the river turns to flow north-west across north Cheshire.|$|R
40|$|Both {{heroes are}} {{on the one hand}} Gilgamesh, {{powerful}} King of Uruk (Mesopotamia) who lived in pre-biblic times around 2600 BC. He is the man of the town. On the other hand Enkidu, the man of the woods, remained in a wild state of evolution. Gilgamesh, having heard about this wild man bearing an extraordinary strength, sends a courtesan to seduce and persuade him to come and meet in the city. He comes, they fight then become inseparable friends. They go together and defeat the guard of the forest of cedars, then they master the heavenly bull sent by the great goddess. But Enkidu dies from disease. Gilgamesh is inconsolable. The horror of the death of his friend invades him. He wants to escape the decomposition of his own flesh. Refusing the false glories of the realm, he roams in search of immortality. There he finds Utanapisti the old wise man, resting on his siesta. He asks him: how were you allowed in the assembly of the Gods, how did you obtain the life without an end? Utanapisti answers: “Demolish your house to build a boat; give up your wealth to save the life. Embark with you specimens of all the animals". Then he {{tells the story of the}} <b>Flood</b> and the <b>Arch.</b> In other words, he proposes a scenario: the one of the Man gardener, rescuer of Nature. He doe...|$|R
