Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E

Alabama, Justice Harlan delivered {{the opinion of the}} court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the NAACP to disclose membership lists.

Florida, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from Brown v. Louisiana, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with Tinker v. Des Moines, in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.|$|E
5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E

The appellate court upheld the temporary restraining order based on {{the second and third}} claims. Specifically, the court affirmed that the students' <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> against compelled speech would be violated by the program's requirement that the student involve explain why their actions were wrong, and the parents' Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> would be violated by the program's moral nature.|$|R
