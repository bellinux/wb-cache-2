The reunion was finally {{confirmed}} by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star, confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.|$|E
25|$|The pilot {{aired on}} June 11, 1987, but NBC {{had decided not}} to pick up the series even before it was shown. Tartikoff didn't want to give up on the show, though, and made a deal with the Disney Channel to air {{thirteen}} episodes of the series in prime time. If the initial order did well, Disney was prepared to order an additional seven-seven. The show was completely retooled, with Mills the sole remaining cast member from the pilot. Miss Bliss's class was changed from the sixth grade to the eight grade, and the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more central to the story.|$|E

[...] The last Crocodile Hunter documentary spanned three hours with footage of Irwin's across-the-world adventure in locations including the Himalayas, the Yangtze River, Borneo, and the Kruger National Park. Irwin went on to star in other Animal Planet documentaries, including Croc Files, The Crocodile Hunter Diaries, and New Breed Vets. During a January 2006 interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Irwin announced that Discovery <b>Kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> developing a show for his daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin – a plan realised after his death as the series Bindi the Jungle Girl.|$|E
500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, as he sees schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. <b>Kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
5000|$|First-time {{director}} Jim Yukich summarized {{his approach}} to the film: [...] "Our characters are like normal kids - three kids on an adventure, so we didn't want to make something that <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>be</b> too afraid to see. ... I'd like {{to make it in}} a funnier, light-hearted vein." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The Caballero's Way", {{in which}} Porter's most famous character, the Cisco Kid, is introduced. It was first {{published}} in 1907 in the July issue of Everybody's Magazine and collected in the book Heart of the West that same year. In later film and TV depictions, the <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily {{on the side of the}} angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature the character, the Kid is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger. The twist ending is, unusually for Porter, tragic.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} Thelma, on {{the other}} hand, was first written as a character who [...] "had kids and stuff like that, but I realized that she couldn’t have kids. The idea that Darryl wanted her to wait, because the <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a sacrifice for him financially, fit perfectly. And, of course, she’s really a child herself. I had {{to set it up}} that way. I love to laugh, and I wanted this to be a movie you were enjoying and having a good time with because you were watching these women get their lives. Even though they would lose them, they were becoming more and more themselves. It was a beautiful experience, a liberating experience to watch that." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} each show, one of {{the adult}} Runaround losers and their <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> called {{to the center of the}} stage. There, Phil and the <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> do gross things to them, such as pouring slime on them, asking them {{questions}} with a messy penalty for a wrong answer delivered by the kid, or getting them to stomp on large purple balloons to make [...] "grape juice". The messy things Phil would do to the adults were based on at least one of the tasks from earlier in the show, usually tasks that were not completed. On the final episode, the tables were turned on Phil. Before Phil could call anyone to the center of the stage, Vivianne & Travis suddenly walked in from backstage. They, along with Phil's own son David, proceeded to slime him with a variety of substances. On another episode, Phil called all three adults center stage and had them bob for apples in a bowl of jello and whipped cream, blindfolded, with the kids giving them directions.|$|R

50|$|Kidz Magazine (1995-2007) was a Boulder County based {{publication}} that {{was started in}} 1995 by entrepreneur and father of six, Scott Smith. Smith developed {{the idea for the}} magazine with Glenn Meyers, another father and Spanish instructor at the University of Colorado-Boulder, as they stood outside their children's school discussing ways to further inspire kids towards reading and writing. Their belief was that <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more interested in reading things that were written by their peers than content created for them by adults. In addition, they believed that <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more inspired to write if they knew it was an audience of peers who would end up reading the material.|$|E

500|$|The series {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of gunge based games too, the first being The Kid Gets It which would involve a celebrity speaking on a subject for 60 seconds without saying a trigger word. If they did, the <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> gunged. In January 2001, the premise evolved into a courtroom setting with a trivial argument between friends trying to be settled. The person the jury found guilty <b>would</b> subsequently <b>be</b> gunged. In March 2001, the game took on the premise of The Leakiest Sink', a parody of The Weakest Link which involved three contestants vying to meet a celebrity. After three rounds of questions which would eliminate one contestant, the remaining two would go onto the final round where the celebrity would pick plugs out of a sink whilst the contestants switched for each one pulled. Whoever was sitting under the tank when the wrong plug <b>was</b> pulled <b>would</b> lose and <b>be</b> gunged, the one left untouched would win.' ...|$|R

Her parents are both Indo-Guyanese, her grandparents having immigrated to Guyana from India. Anjulie's background and what she calls her [...] "racial ambiguity" [...] led to isolation while growing up; in middle school, she said, [...] "the black <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on one side and the white <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the other... so I would mostly hang out by myself and write".

60|$|He {{came and}} sat down again next to me, and my {{attention}} wandered. The q-b was raging for her dinner. It must be quite half-past eight. The kid, the perfect <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone had been out for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand. The girovago, blond, round-faced, mature and aggressive with all his liveliness, {{was more like a}} northerner. In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|R

5000|$|Ricardo was {{a dentist}} who started to paint his face so that <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{afraid of him}} as he worked on their teeth.
