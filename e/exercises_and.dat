40|$|<b>Exercise</b> <b>and</b> dietary {{carbohydrate}} restriction {{during pregnancy}} independently reduce maternal weight gain and offspring survival. It {{was hypothesized that}} the combined stress of <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> dietary carbohydrate restriction would decrease offspring survival more than the independent effects. Within the <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> sedentary groups pregnant rats {{were randomly assigned to}} be fed either 60 %, 40 %, or 20 % dietary carbohydrate ad libitum. No statistical interactions were found between <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> diet. Main effects were found for litter weight, maternal feed intake and weight gain, but not for litter size, pup birthweight, or pup survival in the first two days postpartum. Exercised rats gained less weight and ate more on a per gram body weight basis than sedentary rats. Rats fed carbohydrate restricted diets ate less and gained less weight than the rats fed 60 % carbohydrate. These results demonstrate that the neonatal rat is not vulnerable to the effects of moderate maternal <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> carbohydrate restriction during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{questions}} {{about the relationship between}} pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b> This article presents an overview of published works on a) <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> problems with conception, with the focus on amenorrhea <b>and</b> miscarriage, b) <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> pregnancy, highlighting the influence of exercise on maternal metabolism, cardiovascular and respiratory function, c) <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> the developing embryo / foetus, with the focus on placental formation / growth, substrate availability and foetal hyperthermia, d) <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> the labour / delivery process, with the emphasis on preterm labour, as well as e) <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> the postpartum period, with the focus on neonatal outcome, maternal recovery after parturition and lactation. It concludes with recent recommendations and precautions associated with exercise during pregnancy, as well as shortcomings in available information. In general, literature does not seem to support the concerns about prenatal exercise, but rather shows that both mother and foetus benefit when the mother is involved in moderate exercises during pregnancy. Indications are that the benefits will only be experienced in full by women who, within reasonable limits, continue to exercise throughout their pregnancy...|$|R

In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed.

In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, Sydney was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war footing, where she arrived on 22 August.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Metabolic dysregulation may {{disrupt the}} complex neuroprotective {{mechanisms}} essential for brain health. Recent studies {{have pointed out}} the possible aetiological role of metabolic dysregulation in the onset of schizophrenia and the associated cognitive impairment. In this paper, we aimed to generate a theoretical model of how a combination of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> dietary glucose supplement may help to alleviate cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Methods: Literature on metabolic dysregulation, especially insulin resistance, {{in relation to the}} onset of schizophrenia and the associated cognitive impairment is reviewed. The cognitive enhancement effects of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> dietary glucose supplement are then summarised. Finally, we propose a theoretical model based on the concerted effects of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> glucose supplement. Results: In general, the joint action of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> dietary glucose supplement could up-regulate glucose and insulin transport into the brain, as well as augmenting the release of insulin growth factor- 1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> glucose supplement could enhance energy supply and neuroplasticity in brain, subsequently leading to potential cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia. However, glucose supplement is not suitable for patients with abnormal metabolic profile. Conclusions: The combination of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> glucose supplement has potential therapeutic values in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Further research is necessary to investigate the optimal patterns of <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> doses of glucose for treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
