5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> plan was still not enough {{for the company to}} gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the health}} care system in Denmark is both {{universal}} and tax payer funded, a major driver in the economics of bicycle promotion and investments, comes from savings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system.

And the city estimates that for each kilometre cycled society saves 1.21 DKK <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, added up that amounts to approximately DKK 534 million (USD 91 million) of savings per year, in addition society gains from increased productivity of a healthier work force. Other savings come from reduced congestion and lower road infrastructure maintenance costs.|$|E
