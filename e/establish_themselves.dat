5|$|A few {{jumping spider}} species, {{including}} M. inclemens, {{have been able}} to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in man-made structures. Most often these spiders are found on outbuildings or structures such as fences, rather than in permanently inhabited houses.|$|E
5|$|Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay {{as he and}} Denis Compton {{attempted}} to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves.</b> He was hurried by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot.|$|E
5|$|The Socreds {{hoped to}} <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in Ontario, and {{scheduled}} their opening rally for Massey Hall in Toronto. The rally was a failure, {{and even though}} it ran 40candidates in Ontario (up from 9 in 1953), the party won no seats in the province.|$|E

5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops {{is simply to}} switch from using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} range, escaped birds {{frequently}} <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> {{in areas with}} a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby. Escaped cage-birds established in the wild and such populations have been recorded in the West Indies (Puerto Rico since 1971), Hawaii (since 1883), Australia, Japan and southern United States mainly in Florida and California. In Oahu, Hawaii, they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia and tend to be rare where this competitor is present.|$|E

5|$|Peart soon {{settled into}} his new position, also {{becoming}} the band's primary lyricist. Before joining Rush, {{he had written}} few songs, but, with the other members largely uninterested in writing lyrics, Peart's previously underutilized writing became as noticed as his musicianship. The band was working hard to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> as a recording act, and Peart, {{along with the rest}} of the band, began to undertake extensive touring.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{started on}} 27 October 1952. Boral, a village near Calcutta, was {{selected}} in early 1953 {{as the main}} location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio. The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer Subrata Mitra, who had never operated a film camera. Art director Bansi Chandragupta had professional experience, having worked with Jean Renoir on The River. Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> as respected professionals.|$|E
5|$|The Aghlabids {{had tried}} and failed to take the city soon after their initial landing on the island in 827–828. Despite their repulse there, they managed to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in the western {{portions}} of the island, and in the decades that followed they gradually pushed eastward into the central parts of Sicily. During this period they undertook repeated efforts to capture the capital of the Byzantine province, in 868, 869, and 873, but these failed as well.|$|E

5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves.</b> Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Kuomintang at {{mainland}} China in 1949, Sibu communist members started to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in Sarawak in the early 1950s. Huang Sheng Zi (黄声梓) from Bintangor became the president of Borneo Communist Party (BCP). BCP activities mostly concentrated in Sibu, Sarikei, and Bintangor. His brother, Huang Zeng Ting (黄增霆), {{who was also a}} communist, {{played an important role in}} the formation of first political party in Sarawak, Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) and became the party's first executive secretary. Sarawak Liberation League (SLL) was formed in 1954 following the consolidation of BCP with several other communist organisations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the city's {{population}} had grown to 728, and social organizations began to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in Marysville, including a lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and a Crystal Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons. The first city hall was opened in late 1901, at a cost of $2,000; the building also housed the city's fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply systems were both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction of a high school building.|$|E

5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} morning, Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett's fall for 37. The {{following}} four batsmen {{were unable to}} <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> at the crease and none passed 20. Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving; it took a run out to remove Morris. Australia were eventually out for 389. Morris had scored {{more than half the}} runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on spin; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand {{campaign}} {{was a chance}} for the younger players to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in the national team. Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over Otago. He played in the first match against New Zealand, but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game. The paceman forced his way back into the team for the third match after claiming 4/12 and 5/48 to help to set up an innings victory over Auckland.|$|E

5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae preferentially settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} became {{worse for}} Byzantium {{during the civil}} wars after Andronikos III died. A six-year-long civil war devastated the empire, allowing the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1346) to overrun most of the Empire's remaining territory and establish a Serbian Empire. In 1354, an earthquake at Gallipoli devastated the fort, allowing the Ottomans (who were hired as mercenaries {{during the civil war}} by John VI Kantakouzenos) to <b>establish</b> <b>themselves</b> in Europe. By the time the Byzantine civil wars had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals. Following the Battle of Kosovo, much of the Balkans became dominated by the Ottomans.|$|E
