40|$|A new {{variety of}} English has emerged within the European Union {{institutions}} {{as a result}} of its predominance as a working language and communication vehicle – Euro-English. This lingo is the English version of <b>Eurospeak</b> that has emerged in the process of expressing unique concepts and regulating common aspects for the current 27 national systems. Along this specialised sociolect, the Eurojargon is used by the people involved in EU matters and the media covering related affairs, which includes many acronyms and abbreviations, and words formed with the prefix Euro-. The paper will discuss the anglicisms occurring in Romanian official documents and media materials, called Euro-anglicisms, following the country’s joining the Community...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{that the}} present-day Croatian still {{frequently}} fails {{to have the}} exact translational equivalents for the novel ideas developed and disseminated via metalinguistic <b>Eurospeak,</b> the paper adopts and employs an unorthodox scientific method to refer to an articulated correlation between a conceptual framework theorized (i. e., the noninvasive library digitization projects pertaining to the select Croatian bi- and trilingual lexicography from the 17 th to the 20 th century) and the hypothetical questions addressed (i. e., their applicability to the coinage of Croatian neologisms that formationally imitate the previous paragons), with a pronounced tendency to signify a progressive replacement of the perplexingly anglicized language registers by the more decipherable formality levels. Consequently, such a succinct analysis results in a revalorization of the computerized conversion efforts and a permanent appraisal of the Croatian thesauri, which are neither antiquated nor obsolescent but may be incentively put into service for further similar studies in the subject matter...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the European construction from a dream to a solid economic and then political reality generated numerous official meetings, official documents and legislation which together {{gave birth to a}} specific terminology. Within the Romanian vocabulary the communitary terminology covers a new conceptual field which appeared after 1989. The communitary specialized terminology cannot be conceived or analysed without having in mind the political, legal and institutional framework of the European Union on the one hand; on the other hand, due to its novelty and in spite of the dissemination policy, this terminology is still a rather closed code, not very accessible for the wide public, because of the communication conditions it requires and not necessarily because of its nature. The definitions of communitary terms are usually explicit definitions but most often the definition is based on the context. Most people will agree that the terminology and acronyms of the European Union are difficult to follow, even for those working within the sound of the European Community bells. Eurojargon can be very confusing to the general public. <b>Eurospeak,</b> eurojargon, eurobabble can be very tiresome to comprehend and quick definitions are often impossible to find. Eurojargon could be an attempt to give us Europeans a head start in understanding what is being talked about by people in and out of suits in Europe...|$|E
