5|$|In 17th-century Spain, {{painters}} rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting {{was regarded}} as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of PhilipIV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> Las Meninas, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.|$|E

5|$|The picture <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> of {{his father}} was of a pious {{religious}} man who {{was not interested in}} the affairs of this world. He would spend most of his time reading the Quraan, fasting and hunting during the day and at night would copy the Quraan. He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Rodin's most famous sculptures tends to obscure his total creative output. A prolific artist, he created thousands of busts, figures, and sculptural fragments {{over more than}} five decades. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> in oils (especially in his thirties) and in watercolors. The Musée Rodin holds 7,000 of his drawings and prints, in chalk and charcoal, and thirteen vigorous drypoints. He also produced a single lithograph.|$|E

5|$|When Gauguin {{agreed to}} visit Arles in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the {{realisation}} of {{his idea of}} an artists' collective. While waiting, in August <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> Sunflowers. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, {{as well as the}} study The Poet Against a Starry Sky.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Moore {{returned}} to Melbourne, where <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> images from his Belsen sketches and photographs. They were exhibited commercially, {{but failed to}} sell. The Australian War Memorial initially rejected the material {{because it did not}} depict Australian soldiers; however it accepted them in 1969 when they were donated by Moore. In 201314 the Belsen images formed the basis of a year-long exhibition at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which Moore himself visited at the invitation of the Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. <b>He</b> <b>painted</b> at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E

In 1849, John Ruskin {{spent a month}} in Chamonix, from where <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> some of the massif's mountains before undertaking the Tour of Mont Blanc. When Savoy was eventually annexed to France in 1860, Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie visited the region to mark the event and undertook to enhance road access leading {{to the end of}} the Arve valley.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> his portrait of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E

In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers, lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> another smaller group of orchards, including View of Arles, Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near Arles. In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

5|$|In December 1888 <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> La Berceuse – {{a figure}} that he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1938, van Meegeren moved to Nice, using the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12-bedroom estate at Les Arènes de Cimiez.

5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which <b>he</b> <b>painted</b> two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
