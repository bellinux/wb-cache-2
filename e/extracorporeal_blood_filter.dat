40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> {{purification}} on clinical outcomes in sepsis {{is assumed to}} be related to modulation of plasma cytokine concentrations. To test this hypothesis directly, we treated rats that had a cecal ligation followed by puncture (a standard model of sepsis) with a modest dose of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> purification that did not result in acute changes in a panel of common cytokines associated with inflammation (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 10). Pre- and immediate post-treatment levels of these cytokines were unchanged compared to the sham therapy of <b>extracorporeal</b> circulation without <b>blood</b> purifying sorbent. The overall survival to 7 days, however, was significantly better in animals that received <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> purification compared to those with a sham procedure. This panel of common plasma cytokines along with alanine aminotransferase and creatinine was significantly lower 72 h following <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> purification compared to sham-treated rats. Thus, the effects of this procedure on organ function and survival {{do not appear to be}} due solely to immediate changes in the usual measured circulating cytokines. These results may have important implications for the design and conduct of future trials in sepsis including defining alternative targets for <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> purification and other therapies...|$|R

40|$|A prospective, observational, {{feasibility}} study {{was carried out}} on four patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing bicarbonate hemodialysis to study the feasibility of an on-line hemodiafiltration technique using a citrate dialysate with pre-dilutional infusion of citrate as a technique for regional citrate anticoagulation. All patients had contraindication to systemic heparin anticoagulation. The dialysis technique consisted of an on-line hemodiafiltration with a citrate dialysate without calcium using a Fresenius 4008 S dialysis machine and Fresenius Polysulfone F 60 dialyzers. The infusion solution was procured directly from the dialysate and was infused into the arterial line. To avoid the risk of hypocalcemia, calcium gluconate was infused to the venous return line. The study {{was carried out in}} two stages. During the first stage, the citrate infusion rate was 80 mL/min and the calcium infusion rate was 9 mmol/h. At the second stage, the rates were 100 mL/min and 11 mmol/h, respectively. The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of thrombosis in the <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> circuit and/or the dialyzer. A total of 78 sessions were conducted.

30|$|The primary {{complication}} {{risks of}} ECMO {{are associated with}} cannulation, exposure of blood to foreign materials, the concomitant requirement for systemic anticoagulation, and the stresses induced by mechanical pumping [4]. The degree of risk associated with these factors correlates with the <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> flow rate necessary for treatment [4 – 6]. To provide full extracorporeal oxygenation of venous blood requires circuit flows up to the full cardiac output (4000 – 7000  mL/min) [5, 7]. In contrast, full metabolic CO 2 removal can be achieved at much lower <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> flows. CO 2 is predominantly carried {{in the form of}} highly soluble bicarbonate ion that rapidly restores depleting CO 2 as it is eliminated, and the CO 2 dissociation curve is essentially linear and does not saturate like the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve [8 – 10]. These differences also provide the opportunity to augment CO 2 removal efficiency with gas exchanger design features aimed at reducing the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer at the gas exchange surface, where gas transport through blood is limited to diffusion [11].|$|R

In this study the biocompatibility of a covalently end-point-attached heparin coating was analyzed in different in-vitro and in-vivo-models considering coagulation and complement systems.

Significantly increased binding of complement inhibitors C 1 Inhibitor and factor H on HBS lead to significantly reduced detection of activation specific complement proteins (iC 3 b and C 5 b- 9) demonstrating reduced complement activation. Analysis of alternative C 3 -convertase and soluble terminal complement complex in blood revealed decreased activation for HBS. In-vivo-experiments with adult sheep compared ECMO with HBS or with unmodified surfaces for 120 hrs.

40|$|Background. Toxic shock {{syndrome}} is a potentially fatal toxin-mediated disease.
