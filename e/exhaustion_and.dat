Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease and <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E

5|$|Australian and Papuan troops {{advanced}} {{along the}} coast of the Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed {{in the early stages of}} the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces.|$|E
5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters.

She had to change the costumes and makeup for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E

In the 200m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat behind Wenden and scraped into the final by 0.3s as the seventh fastest qualifier. He improved his time by 0.1s in the final to finish sixth in 2min 0.9s. Wenden won both events. After the 200m final, Wenden lost consciousness due to <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> sank underwater. Wenden was pulled from the water and saved after Windle noticed the incident.|$|E
30|$|Burnout {{and sleep}} {{difficulties}} {{are related to}} distress in the learning environment during preclinical years (Mazurkiewicz et al. 2012). This student distress can lead to emotional <b>exhaustion,</b> depersonalization <b>and</b> reduced personal accomplishment, which are burnout dimensions according to Maslach et al. (1996). When adjusted to students, burnout concept comprises emotional <b>exhaustion,</b> cynicism, <b>and</b> low academic efficacy. Student distress {{can also lead to}} sleep difficulties, which include problems in falling asleep, mid-sleep awakenings, waking up too early, snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and restless sleep (Falavigna et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of January 4, the KPA I Corps, the PVA 38th Corps and the PVA 50th Corps entered Seoul, but they were only greeted by an empty city in flames. Most of the civilians had either fled south through the frozen Han River or evacuated to the nearby countryside. The South Korean government in Seoul, which was reduced to essential personnel before the battle, also left the city with little difficulties. A Chinese platoon reached the Seoul City Hall at about 13:00 and raised the North Korean flag. On January 5, Peng ordered the PVA 50th Corps and the KPA I Corps to seize Gimpo and Incheon while instructing all other units {{to rest on the}} northern bank of the Han River. By January 7, Peng halted the Third Phase Campaign due to troop <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> to prevent a repeat of the Incheon landing.|$|E

The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
5|$|One of Treloar's duties {{throughout}} much of the war was to compile and edit service annual books, which were compilations of articles written by military personnel and published by the AWM. He first proposed this in mid-1941 as an equivalent of The Anzac Book, which was a collection of anecdotes written by Australian soldiers during the Gallipoli Campaign. The first of these books, entitled Active Service, was printed during late 1941 and early 1942 and eventually sold 138,208 copies. Seventeen service annual books were produced during and after the war, with combined sales of 1,907,446 copies. These books were sold at a profit and earned the Memorial large amounts of money. Treloar's editorial role came on top of his full-time duties as head of the MHS {{and was one of the}} main causes of his <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> anxiety in the final years of the war.|$|E

The Commonwealth forces, led by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, were helped by Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny and his Cossacks, who raised against the Turks and Tatars and participated in the upcoming campaign. In practice about 30,000 regular army and 25,000 Cossacks faced at Khotyn a much larger Ottoman force under Osman II. Fierce Turkish attacks against the fortified Commonwealth positions lasted throughout September 1621 and were repelled. The <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> depletion of its forces made the Ottoman Empire sign the Treaty of Khotyn, which had kept the old territorial status quo of Sigismund II (Dniester River border between the Commonwealth and Ottoman combatants), a favorable for the Polish side outcome. After Osman II was killed in a coup, ratification of the treaty was obtained from his successor Mustafa I.|$|E
5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food {{appears to have a}} significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> lameness. Other large plains animals, including the mountain zebra, may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel <b>exhaustion</b> <b>and</b> engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{order to}} fill the gap of tool for {{measurement}} of student burnout in Iran, this study was performed on the 238 female students of Isfahan university that were selected by simple random sampling. Materials and Methods: The inventory is including 15 items and three subscales. Data were presented by analytical and descriptive statistic and draw table. In order to determine reliability of MBI-SS were used internal consistency method and test-retest. Results: Coefficient Cronbach's alpha for the <b>exhaustion,</b> cynicism <b>and</b> academic efficacy respectively was 88, 90, 84 (p< 0. 05) and showed good internal consistency. Also test-retest reliability about 4 weeks later, obtaining a reliability coefficient of 89, 84 and 67 (p< 0. 01) respectively for <b>exhaustion,</b> cynicism <b>and</b> academic efficacy. Principle component factor analysis with exploration method with warimax rotation was used to determine construct validity. In order to check the concurrent validity and divergent validity of this inventory were used respectively from the University Student Depression Inventory and the researcher made of scale interest to academic filed and coefficients for the <b>exhaustion,</b> cynicism <b>and</b> academic efficacy respectively were obtained - 21, - 53, - 32 (p< 0. 01). Also concurrent validity for <b>exhaustion,</b> cynicism <b>and</b> academic efficacy respectively were obtained 74, 68 and 50 (p< 0. 01).
