50|$|It {{was stated}} in a {{statuary}} report, under the Reservoir Safety Act 1975, dated 12 June 1984, that all five reservoirs could be over-topped during a Probable Maximum Flood, so major works were undertaken. The retention level was raisd by 3.81 m, the <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> by 1.8 metres, and the wave wall was rebuilt. An 80 m wide auxiliary spillway was constructed, two new 900 mm butterfly valves installed and existing valves descaled and motorised. The 11kV overhead powerline was routed {{in a new}} <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> duct.|$|E
50|$|The {{storage level}} of the {{reservoir}} remained the same but the <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> was raised by 6.7 m, which meant replacing the B6105 road {{at a higher level}} and on a new course. An impervious clay membrane was laid in the upstream face to provide continuity with the 1877 embankment. This was protected with concrete matting faced in stone. The length of the overflow sill was reduced and a new concrete box section installed to throttle the flow, which was directed into the Etherow Pool. A replacement 1400 mm diameter guard valve was installed.|$|E

40|$|Recent severe {{flooding}} in the UK has highlighted {{the need for}} better information on flood risk, increasing the pressure on engineers to enhance the capabilities of computer models for flood prediction. This paper evaluates the benefits {{to be gained from}} the use of remotely sensed data to support flood modelling. The remotely sensed data available can be used either to produce high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) (light detection and ranging (Lidar) data), or to generate accurate inundation mapping of past flood events (airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and aerial photography). The paper reports on the modelling of real flood events that occurred at two UK sites on the rivers Severn and Ouse. At these sites a combination of remotely sensed data and recorded hydrographs was available. It is concluded first that light detection and ranging Lidar generated DTMs support the generation of considerably better models and enhance the visualisation of model results and second that flood outlines obtained from airborne SAR or aerial images help develop an appreciation of the hydraulic behaviour of important model components, and facilitate model validation. The need for further research is highlighted by a number of limitations, namely: the difficulties in obtaining an adequate representation of hydraulically important features such as <b>embankment</b> <b>crests</b> and walls; uncertainties in the validation data; and difficulties in extracting flood outlines from airborne SAR images in urban areas...|$|R

It is concluded that Turc method with original coefficients, 300 and 0. 9, could not be used because of huge discrepancies between the measured and calculated values. Instead, coefficients of 601 and 0. 65, respectively, were used after the correction using long term measured flow rates. Employing the modified Turc method for these research basins, reservoirs volume are reduced by 50. 7 %.

40|$|We {{have used}} 14 multifrequency helicopter-borne {{electromagnetic}} (HEM) surveys {{to determine the}} internal structure and integrity of mine-impoundment structures in West Virginia, U. S. A. - the first time such technology has been applied in this way and apparently well suited for such activities. The HEM surveys identified areas of concern {{in each of the}} impoundments investigated. In most cases, these were areas where filtrate was emerging high on the downstream embankment and represented an erosion risk. Of greater concern, the HEM survey identified thick bodies of slurry that remained unconsolidated and were buried deep beneath the <b>embankment's</b> <b>crest</b> of some impoundments. Ground confirmation activities indicated that HEM survey interpretations provided an accurate representation of the conductivity distribution within coal-waste impoundments. We then interpreted the conductivity/depth images from the HEMsurveys to provide a snapshot of hydrologic conditions that existed within the impoundment {{at the time of the}} survey. Resistivity profiles were obtained at the inactive impoundment along segments of flight lines from the HEM survey. HEM and resistivity surveys detected a conductive layer at a depth of about 7 m that was interpreted to be unconsolidated coal slurry. The methods also detected conductive bodies at a depth of about 26 m that were interpreted to be flooded mine works. Resistivity surveys from these segments corroborated HEM data, thereby providing independent confirmation of the HEM data and its processing. The resistivity and HEM surveys indicated a resistive surface layer where the coarse coal refuse was placed. Beneath the resistive surface layer is a conductive layer of unconsolidated or partially consolidated coal slurry. These highly loaded bodies of unconsolidated slurry are susceptible to solifluction, which can threaten embankment stability. Underground mine workings were identified in the HEM data from one impoundment. © 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists...|$|R
60|$|THE way led along {{upon what}} had once been the {{embankment}} of a railroad. But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on either side swelled up the slopes of the <b>embankment</b> and <b>crested</b> across it in a green wave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow as a man's body, and {{was no more than a}} wild-animal runway. Occasionally, a piece of rusty iron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the ties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at a connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view. The tie had evidently followed the rail, held to it by the spike long enough for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves, so that now the crumbling, rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant. Old as the road was, it was manifest that it had been of the mono-rail type.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{function}} of seawalls and embankments {{is to protect}} against damage and injury caused by flooding. Coastal flooding is caused by combinations of high tides, waves, wind set-up and storm surges driven by low-pressure systems. However with global warming causing sea levels to rise and with increased storminess causing more extreme waves and storm surges, the likelihood of overtopping of seawalls with zero or negative freeboard may well be expected to increase. Researchers using physical and numerical models to develop design formulae have widely investigated wave overtopping of seawalls with positive freeboard. However the design of seawalls with zero or negative freeboard has attracted much less attention, and some variation exists between overtopping discharge calculated with current design formulae. The focus of this thesis is the extreme situation when overtopping caused by storm waves is combined with surge levels above the <b>embankment</b> <b>crest.</b> The local highly accelerative flow over the <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> caused by the high surge level will significantly alter the flow at the crest. This {{is likely to have}} a highly non-linear effect upon the overtopping waves. In this thesis, the flow is investigated with a 2 DV numerical model based on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations developed by Lin and Liu (1998 a). The model describes the flow characteristics of a breaking wave such as the velocities within the wave as well as the turbulence at the seabed boundary layer. As an example of the model’s ability to describe complex hydrodynamic flows, this study investigates its ability to represent the second order mass transport under progressive and standing waves. The model results are compared with available theory and experimental results. This shows that mass transport is successfully predicted, although there is some variation in the magnitude compared to the experimental and theoretical results. To consider the model’s ability to simulate storm surge wave overtopping of embankments, the RANS model has been used to simulate an experimental study conducted by Hughes and Nadal (2009). To examine the success of the model at reproducing the wave generation, transformation and overtopping processes the model results have been compared with the experimental laboratory data. This makes possible a wave-by-wave comparison of overtopping parameters such as discharge, depth and velocity for a storm surge event. Additionally the overtopping discharge predicted by the model is compared with design formulae and the differences in the overtopping discharge calculated with current design formulae are investigated and explained. Finally, the RANS model is used to determine the effect of <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> width on the magnitude of the overtopping discharge. Results from RANS model tests are used to provide design guidance {{in the form of an}} equation that allows the effect of crest width to be included when evaluating combined discharge at embankments.

Available data include acceleration records from sensors mounted on the model levee {{and on the ground}} surface near the model levee, and acceleration and pore pressure measurements from sensors embedded in the underlying peat.

40|$|The Turc Method is used {{widely in}} Turkey to {{determine}} runoff depths therefore, water yield {{from a particular}} watershed and subsequently the reservoir’s volume by Turkish General Directorate of Rural Services {{which is responsible for}} the investments on agricultural and rural infrastructures. However the method over predicts the water yield markedly when compared to the directly measured long-term water yields, which increases the total cost for the instruction of reservoirs and leads to environmental hazards due to disturbing more agricultural areas. In this research, the Turc Method was modifi ed through replacing the new coeffi cients with the original coeffi cients of the 300 and 0. 9 by fi tting the calculated values to the directly measured long-term, a total of 223 years, in 22 sub-basin distributed throughout Turkey.

The country’s sub-basins divided into three groups in terms of basin characteristics affective on these coeffi cients and new coeffi cients were also suggested for each group. Employing the modifi ed Turc Method with these new coeffi cients for the research sub-basins can reduce the reservoir’s volume by 45 % and this may decrease the total cost of the reservoirs by about 20 - 25 % through reducing occupied surface area, <b>embankment</b> and <b>crest</b> height...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{performance}} evaluation of embankment dams {{are applied to}} confirm that the earthquake-induced settlement of <b>embankment</b> dams <b>crest</b> is enough small, because the overflow from the crest could cause catastrophic failure of embankment dams. Now in Japan, trial of “Guidelines for Seismic Performance Evaluation of Dams during Large Earthquakes (Draft) ” has been conducted. According to the guidelines, earthquake-induced settlement of dam crest should be basically evaluated by the method combining dynamic analysis and Newmark’s method. This method uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and next calculates the deformation as an amount of displacement of the slip circle due to earthquake response. But other deformation evaluation method for embankment dams has been recently developed based on cumulative damage theory. The deformation evaluation method based on cumulative damage theory also uses the dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method, and calculates the deformation as a residual strain by cyclic loading due to earthquake response. In this paper, we first describe dynamic analysis based on the equivalent linearization method for a rockfill dam with a central earth core, and then evaluate the settlement obtained from cumulative damage theory. The results of our research make it clear that the settlement of model dam crest ranges from about 36 cm to 160 cm based on cumulative damage theory due to an earthquake motion with a maximum acceleration of more than 700 gal. The observed settlement of the <b>crest</b> of existing <b>embankment</b> dams due to earthquakes are compared to the calculated values based on the cumulative damage theory, and we confirm that relationship between observed values of existing dams and calculated values of model dam has a good coincidence and that cumulative damage theory is available to evaluate the settlement of dam crest due to a large earthquake...|$|R
40|$|A site {{inspection}} of an embankment on the West Coast Main Line (UK) revealed a general de-terioration of the embankment, significant {{movement of the}} trackside services and waterlogging and bulging along the embankment toe.

Site investigation, ground monitoring and analytical modelling indicated that the em-bankment was at limiting equilibrium and that recent progressive movement was occurring along a rotational slip surface located within the embankment core (ash and slag materials overlying reworked glacial till).

However, the density of the pfa varies with depth with loose material underlying a denser surface layer, in a pattern that probably results from the water level in the lagoon during pfa deposition. Settlement under the trial embankment was apparently largely complete {{by the end of the}} construction period (17 days), with approximately 300 mm of settlement under the crest of the embankment.

The earth dam selected for this study is the Carite Dam in Guayama, Puerto Rico. This embankment dam was built in 1913 in different phases with a raised <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> for flooding control in 1995. A finite element of the dam was developed to perform several incremental dynamic analyses. The dam geometry and materials properties were estimated based on extensive review of borings logs and technical reports provided by the administrators of the dam. The dynamic analyses were accomplished using seismic ground records with response spectrum made compatible with the design response spectrum from the ASCE- 10 standard. Crest horizontal displacements were obtained from the dynamic analyses for different incremental factors and used to estimate moment magnitude and epicentral distances needed to attain the displacement limits.|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} Bay of Bengal {{is home to}} some of {{the deadliest}} cyclones recorded during the last decades. Storm surge models developed for this region significantly improved in recent years, but they still fail to predict patterns of coastal flooding with sufficient accuracy. In the present paper, we make use of a state-of-the art numerical modeling system with improved bathymetric and topographic data to identify the strengths, weaknesses, and to suggest areas for improvement of current storm surge models in this area. The new model is found to perform relatively well in reproducing waves characteristics and maximum water levels for the two extreme cyclones studied here: Phailin (2013) and Sidr (2007). The wave setup turns out to be small compared to the wind-driven surge, although it still plays a significant role for inland flooding. Relatively large tide-surge interactions mainly due to shallow water effects are also evidenced by the model. These findings plead in favor of further efforts to improve the representation of the bathymetry, especially in the nearshore area, and the implementation of models including tides and radiation stresses explicitly. The main limit of the model is its inability to predict the detailed patterns of coastal flooding satisfactorily. The reason lies mainly in the fact that topographic data also need to be further improved. In particular, a good knowledge of <b>embankments</b> characteristics (<b>crest</b> elevation and their condition) is found to be of primary importance to represent inland flooding correctly. Public authorities should take urgent action to ensure that better data are available to the scientific community, so that state-of-the-art storm surge models reaching a sufficiently high level of confidence can be used for emergency preparedness and to implement mitigation strategies in the northern Bay of Bengal...|$|R
40|$|Deriving the bed shear {{stresses}} from hydrodynamic models in breach models is challenging {{due to the}} continuous changing hydraulic head over the breach in combination with horizontal and vertical flow contractions, and the continuous rapidly changing breach geometry. Three stages can be distinguished in breach flows. Stage 1 initiates when the embankment starts to overflow and is characterized by flows over the <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> and down the landside slope. Stage 2 initiates when the landside slope has retreated towards the waterside slope. The hydraulic head increases rapidly and the flow contracts both horizontally and vertically resulting in a fully 3 -dimensional flow. During Stage 3 a full breach has developed and the flow contracts mainly horizontally. This paper presents a SWOT analysis of flow modelling methods applied in breach models to derive the bed {{shear stresses}}.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies have been}} carried out into the desiccation fissuring of clay fill for flood embankments. The preliminary results confirmed that desiccation fissuring occurs to a depth of typically 60 cm within the outer surface of a flood embankment constructed from clay fill and can occur within 2 years of construction. The critical condition occurs when desiccation creates an interconnected network of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal fissures that increases the mass permeability of the fill material similar to that of coarse sand or gravel and hence allows rapid seepage of flood water through the surface layer of the <b>embankment</b> (<b>crest</b> and sides slopes). The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of desiccation fissuring on the stability of flood embankments, In particular, the main objectives of this thesis are as follows: 1. Survey of flood embankments in UK constructed from clay fill to determine the extent and nature of desiccation fissuring. 2.

Failure was initiated at mid-height when an embedded 12 -mm (½-inch) diameter rebar {{was removed from the}} embankment.

40|$|Flood {{frequency}} analysis (FFA) concentrates on peak flows of flood hydrographs. However, floods that last years devastated {{large parts of}} Poland lead us to revision of the views on the assessment of flood risk in Poland. It turned {{out that it is}} the prolonged exposure to high water on levees that causes floods, not only the water overflowing the levee crest. This is because, the levees are weakened by water and their disruption occurs when it seems that the danger is over, i. e. after passing culmination. Two main causes of inundation of embanked rivers, namely over-crest flow and wash out of the levees, are combined to assess the total risk of inundation. Therefore the risk of inundation is the total of risk of exceeding <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> by flood peak and risk of washout of levees. Hence, while modeling the flood events in addition to the maximum flow one should consider also the duration of high water in a river channel, Analysis of the frequency of annual peak flows based on annual maxima and peaks over threshold is the subject of countless publica-tions. Therefore we will here mainly modeling the duration of high water levels.

40|$|AbstractDeep mixed column (DMC) {{is known}} as one of the {{effective}} methods for stabilizing the natural earth beneath road or railway embankments to control stability and settlements under traffic loads. The load distribution mechanism of embankment overlying on loose subgrades stabilized with DMCs considerably depends on the columns' mechanical and geometrical specifications. The present study uses the laboratory investigation to understand the behavior of embankments lying on loose sandy subgrade in three different conditions: (1) subgrade without reinforcement, (2) subgrade reinforced with DMCs in a triangular pattern and horizontal plan, and (3) subgrade reinforced with DMCs in a square pattern and horizontal plan. For this purpose, by adopting the scale factor of 1 : 10, a reference embankment with 20  cm height, 250  cm length, and 93 % maximum dry density achieved in standard Proctor compaction test was constructed over a 70  cm thick loose sandy bed with the relative density of 50 % in a loading chamber, and its load-displacement behavior was evaluated until the failure occurred. In the next two tests, DMCs (with 10  cm diameter, 40  cm length, and 25  cm center-to-center spacing) were placed in groups in two different patterns (square and triangular) in the same sandy bed beneath the embankment and, consequently, the embankments were constructed over the reinforced subgrades and gradually loaded until the failure happened. In all the three tests, the load-displacement behaviors of the embankment and the selected DMCs were instrumented for monitoring purpose. The obtained results implied 64 % increase in failure load and 40 % decrease in <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> settlement when using the square pattern of DMCs compared with those of the reference embankment, while these values were 63 % and 12 %, respectively, for DMCs in triangular pattern. This confirmed generally better performance of DMCs with a triangular pattern...|$|E
40|$|The Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) {{concentrates}} on probability distribution of peak flows of flood hydrographs. However, examination of floods that haunted and devastated the {{large parts of}} Poland lead us to revision of the views on the assessment of flood risk of Polish rivers. It turned out that flooding is caused not only by overflow of the levees' crest but mostly due to the prolonged exposure to high water on levees structure causing dangerous leaks and breaches that threaten their total destruction. This is because, the levees are weakened by long-lasting water pressure {{and as a matter}} of fact their damage usually occurs after the culmination has passed the affected location. The probability of inundation is the total of probabilities of exceeding <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> by flood peak and the probability of washout of levees. Therefore, in addition to the maximum flow one should consider also the duration of high waters in a river channel. In the paper the new two-component model of flood dynamics: "Duration of high waters–Discharge Threshold–Probability of non-exceedance" (DqF), with the methodology of its parameters estimation was proposed as a completion to the classical FFA methods. Such model can estimate the duration of stages (flows) of an assumed magnitude with a given probability of exceedance. The model combined with the technical evaluation of probability of levees breach due to the d -days duration of flow above alarm stage gives the annual probability of inundation caused by the embankment breaking. The results of theoretical investigation were illustrated by a practical example of the model implementation to the series of daily flow of the Vistula River at Szczucin. Regardless promising results, the method of risk assessment due to prolonged exposure of levees to high water is still in its infancy despite its great cognitive potential and practical importance. Therefore, we would like to point out the need for and usefulness of the DqF model as complementary to the analysis of the flood peak flows, as in classical FFA. The presented two-component model combined with the routine flood frequency model constitutes a new direction in FFA for embanked rivers...|$|E
40|$|Breaching is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of embankment failure in the world. Due to overtopping, an embankment starts to breach when part of the embankment actually breaks away, leaving an opening for water to flood the land protected by the embankment. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused by surface erosion and/or headcut erosion in the embankment. The magnitude and extent of the losses depend highly on the rate of breaching of the embankment, which determines the discharge through the breach and the speed and rate of inundation of the valley or polder. Therefore, modelling of the breach evolution in embankments is of significant interest for damage assessment and risk analysis. It is also important {{for the development of}} early warning systems for dike and dam failures and of evacuation plans for people at risk. The breach flow {{plays an important role in}} the embankment breaching process, coupling the hydraulic process and the sediment transport process. During the breaching process, the flow overtops the entire <b>embankment</b> <b>crest</b> and generates the breach channel in the initial phase of the breach development. As the breach further develops, the breach flow goes only through the breach channel due to the decrease of the upstream water level. The breach flow can thus be classified as compound weir flow and weir flow, each having own special characteristics. In a breach, the helicoidal flow accelerates the sediment undermining at the toe of the breach slopes and widens the breach in the lateral direction of the embankment. A triangular hydraulic jump happens when the breach flow changes from supercritical flow into subcritical flow, with a triangular critical area at the toe of the breach. The triangular hydraulic jump works as a driving force to the headcut erosion in the breaching process and the scour hole development at the toe of embankment. According to the hydraulic energy loss in the breach, the discharge coefficients are deducted for both weir flow condition and compound weir flow condition. The resulting discharge coefficients can be used in the calculation of the breach discharge in a breach model. In the present study, five runs of breach experiments were conducted in a relative large laboratory flume. The experimental results clearly expose the hydrodynamic process and the erosion process in the breaching of the cohesive embankment. The breaching starts with the initial erosion of the embankment surface washing away the embankment surface. Due to the surface erosion at the toe of the embankment, the headcut erosion is stimulated on the embankment slope. While headcut migration stimulates the breach to develop in longitudinal direction, the lateral erosion triggers the breach to widen in lateral direction. Three types of erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion) contribute to the breach erosion process in the embankment, however, the breach flow is the driving force for the erosion. Sediment deposition in the breaching process, generally ignored in the embankment breaching studies, is also of importance. A mathematical model has been developed that couples weir flow and erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion). The breaching process is simplified into initial development, deepening development and widening development, corresponding with surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion, respectively. As the link between flow and embankment material, erosion plays a key role in the embankment breach model. Mathematical descriptions of the headcut migration and the lateral migration rate have been developed to simulate the breaching process in cohesive embankments. The headcut erosion and the lateral erosion are considered to occur in the form of clay blocks instead of in the form of individual clay particles.
