25|$|Portal Vein Embolization (PVE): Using a {{percutaneous}} transhepatic approach, an <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologist</b> embolizes {{the portal}} vein supplying {{the side of}} the liver with the tumor. Compensatory hypertrophy of the surviving lobe can qualify the patient for resection. This procedure can also serve as a bridge to transplant.|$|E
25|$|After {{achieving}} {{a certificate of}} completion of training (CCT), many fellowship posts exist in specialities such as neurointervention and vascular intervention, which would allow the Doctor to work as an <b>Interventional</b> <b>Radiologist.</b> In some cases, the CCT date can be deferred by a year to include these fellowship programmes.|$|E
25|$|Lumpectomy {{techniques}} are increasingly utilized for breast-conservation cancer surgery. Studies indicate that {{for patients with}} a single tumor smaller than 4cm, a lumpectomy with negative surgical margins may {{be as effective as}} a mastectomy. Prior to a lumpectomy, a needle-localization of the lesion with placement of a guidewire may be performed, sometimes by an <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologist</b> if the area being removed was detected by mammography or ultrasound, and sometimes by the surgeon if the lesion can be directly palpated.|$|E

25|$|Selective {{internal}} radiation therapy (SIRT) {{can be used}} to destroy the tumor from within (thus minimizing exposure to healthy tissue). Similar to TACE, this is a procedure in which an <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologist</b> selectively injects the artery or arteries supplying the tumor with a chemotherapeutic agent. The agent is typically Yttrium-90 (Y-90) incorporated into embolic microspheres that lodge in the tumor vasculature causing ischemia and delivering their radiation dose directly to the lesion. This technique allows for a higher, local dose of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissue. While not curative, patients have increased survival. No studies have been done to compare whether SIRT is superior to TACE in terms of survival outcomes, although retrospective studies suggest similar efficacy. There are currently two products available, SIR-Spheres and TheraSphere. The latter is an FDA approved treatment for primary liver cancer (HCC) which has been shown in clinical trials to increase the survival rate of low-risk patients. SIR-Spheres are FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer but outside the US SIR-Spheres are approved for the treatment of any non-resectable liver cancer including primary liver cancer.|$|E

2500|$|A {{drug-eluting}} stent (DES) is {{a peripheral}} or coronary stent (a scaffold) placed into narrowed, diseased peripheral or coronary arteries that slowly releases {{a drug to}} block cell proliferation. This prevents fibrosis that, together with clots (thrombi), could otherwise block the stented artery, a process called restenosis. [...] The stent is usually placed within the peripheral or coronary artery by an interventional cardiologist or <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologist</b> during an angioplasty procedure.|$|E

40|$|Interventional {{radiology}} (IR) is {{a rapidly}} expanding specialty that {{is facing the}} challenges of turf wars and personnel shortages. Appropriate exposure of medical students to this field can be vital to recruitment of potential future trainees or referring physicians. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the knowledge and views of final-year medical students in a single EU country regarding various aspects of IR. An electronic survey was sent via e-mail to all final-year medical students in a European country. The students were given a month to respond to the questionnaire. A total of 234 students of 675 (34. 5 %) replied to the survey. Of the respondents, 35 % had previously completed an attachment to the radiology department. The majority of students (63 %) thought their knowledge in radiology in general was poor. The percentage of students who correctly identified procedures performed by <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> was 69 % for Hickman line insertion, 79 % for fibroid embolization, and 67. 5 % for lower limb angioplasty. Sixty percent, 30 %, and 47 % thought that <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> perform cardiac angioplasties, perform arterial bypasses, and create AV fistulas, respectively. Forty-nine percent felt that <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> are surgically trained. Eighty-three percent of students were first made aware of angioplasty by a cardiologist. Thirty-one percent thought that <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> do ward rounds, 24 % thought that <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> have admitting rights, and 26 % felt that <b>interventional</b> <b>radiologists</b> run an outpatient practice. A significant number of students (76 %) thought that the job prospects in IR are good or excellent but only 40. 5 % were willing to consider a career in IR. In conclusion, this study indicates that IR remains a nascent but attractive specialty to the majority of medical students. Further development of the existing informal undergraduate curriculum to address shortcomings will ensure that IR continues to attract the brightest talents to the field...|$|R
