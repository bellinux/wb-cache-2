50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> calcine-charged <b>furnaces,</b> a {{significant}} portion of the sulfur has been eliminated during the roasting stage, and the calcine consists of a mixture of copper and iron oxides and sulfides. The reverberatory furnace acts to allow these species to approach chemical equilibrium at the furnace operating temperature (approximately 1600 °C at the burner <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> and about 1200 °C at the flue end; the matte is about 1100 °C and the slag is about 1195 °C). In this equilibration process, oxygen associated with copper compounds exchanges with sulfur associated with iron compounds, increasing the iron oxide content <b>of</b> the <b>furnace,</b> and the iron oxides interact with silica and other oxide materials to form the slag.|$|R
50|$|The hearth may be {{hemispherical}} in shape, or in {{an eccentric}} bottom tapping furnace (see below), the hearth has {{the shape of a}} halved egg. In modern meltshops, the furnace is often raised off the ground floor, so that ladles and slag pots can easily be maneuvered under either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace.</b> Separate from the furnace structure is the electrode support and electrical system, and the tilting platform on which the furnace rests. Two configurations are possible: the electrode supports and the roof tilt with the furnace, or are fixed to the raised platform.|$|R
50|$|However, by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace's</b> lifetime, other {{problems}} had become apparent. The pig iron market {{was already in}} decline {{by the time the}} furnace was built in 1888, with prices rarely rising above $22 per ton until World War I. But it was the rise of the integrated steel plant that really sealed the fate <b>of</b> Bellefonte's <b>furnaces.</b> As steel producers increasingly made their own iron and converted it to steel on site, the utility of merchant pig producers such as Bellefonte Furnace dwindled. Easily mined, high-grade Mesabi Range iron ore negated the advantage of the local deposits in the Nittany Valley; in fact, it was the availability of Mesabi ore that led Carnegie to sell the Scotia mines to Gephart.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reverberatory furnace}} was a Welsh {{technology}} and {{was essentially a}} masonry hearth with a roof erected over it. The Welsh process happened to be very well suited to the rich carbonate ores that characterised the early copper discoveries. Finely crushed and concentrated copper ore is mixed with the flux (chemicals or other substances added to a load of ore and fuel) and spread on the hearth, under which an intense fire is lit in a firebox situated at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace,</b> allowing a flame to pass over the ore. [...] Common practice from the period was to fire the furnace for up to twenty-four hours, following which the matte (the intermediate product of the smelting process consisting of 40-55% copper) and slag were extracted from separate openings and at different levels on the sides <b>of</b> the <b>furnace.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Adopting coal as {{the main}} source of fuel created {{numerous}} problems for glass production. Burning coal produced short flames which shifted the location of the hearth from the far <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> to the center. Air draughts are also necessary to create a regenerative heating system for glassmelting. [...] Early coal furnaces, such as at Bolsterstone, contain underground flues to provide an easy way to remove ash.Additionally, the carbon from the coal fumes contaminated the glass in the uncovered pots which created a dark and often uneven colour. Lids, such as those found at Bolsterstone, needed to be implemented to prevent these impurities.Glass bottles from this initial transition are often dark in color.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of non-metallic inclusions, their volume fraction {{and the final}} size distribution are crucial issues for steelmakers. This survey aims at elaborating a kinetic model, integrated with thermodynamics, designed to forecast the inclusion concentration and their dimensional distribution at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> ladle <b>furnace</b> (LF) treatments. The computational model is based on collision frequency function and introduces several assumptions concerning collision growth mechanism and inclusion removal by effect of inert gas stirring. Dimensional distribution and volume fraction provided by the model are compared to the experimental characterization results for steel samples from different heats. Moreover, the implemented model allows an estimation of the influence associated to the main process parameters, such as temperature, argon flow rate and treatment time...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Some years ago an old lignite fired power plant provided with two steam generators of 420 t/h, has been revamped {{in the northern part}} of Romania. This operation was focused mainly upon the changing of the initial type of fuel – Romanian lignite – into bituminous coal, including new type of burners also. At the same time, some geometrical modifications have been added to the furnace due to the new burners’ particularities. After two years of operation, a lot of functional problems have been recorded especially regarding the high flue gas temperature at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> (sometimes greater that the melting point of the ash) due to a lower intensity of the heat transfer process; at the same time a great difference between the flue gas temperature occurs on the left part <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> in comparison with the right part.

40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers {{account for the}} majority <b>of</b> <b>furnace</b> electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption <b>of</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption <b>of</b> a <b>furnace</b> blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each <b>furnace</b> firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|R
40|$|The Sub-Compact Seebeck Furnace (SCSF) {{is a third}} {{generation}} furnace designed as an experimental facility to study the phenomena of undercooling associated with directional solidification. It is intended to provide a double peak temperature profile along the axial direction with gradient zones at each end. By keeping {{the temperature in the}} central portion above the melting point of the sample, and cooling the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace,</b> a solid/liquid (S/L) interface can be maintained in each one of the gradient zones. A motorized motion control provides a motion to one-half <b>of</b> the <b>furnace.</b> The undercooling associated with the interface being directionally solidified can thus be studied. Modeling of the temperature profile is important to help assure that the furnace design provides the correct thermal characteristics. The furnace is designed with two halves that telescope. Results of thermal analysis based on an analytical solution using simple assumptions will be presented. The resulting temperature profile will show the salient features of the desired thermal profile and provide the general directions for thermal design. Experimental results will be used to compare with the analytical profile. Approach for numerical modeling to provide more detailed information such as two-dimensional effects will be discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a calcium-bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or refined alumina for white and refractory cements). The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill. In the case of high-alumina refractory cements, where the mix only sinters, a rotary kiln can be used.|$|R

40|$|When designing, {{engineering}} and constructing the hearth wall <b>of</b> a blast <b>furnace,</b> traditional thinking {{predicts that the}} hearth wall will erode to {{the locations of the}} 1, 150 ˚C isotherm. This philosophy is {{based on the fact that}} at elevated carbon content (> 2 %), iron solidifies at 1, 150 ˚C. In strict thermo-chemical theory, it is impossible for a carbon hearth wall refractory to wear beyond that point. Operators even use this theory in their online thermal models to estimate current wear by extrapolating the location of the 1, 150 ˚C isotherm from actual temperature measurements. As we will show examples of in this paper, the theory fails to explain why in reality, most large-block hearth walls experience much more severe wear over their lifetimes. It is often reported that block hearth walls have minimal refractory remaining, the carbon blocks are cracked and brittle, and that the wear dictated the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> campaign, or at least a major repair. Such results are inconsistent with the theory, yet its use continues without regard for its shortcomings. It is also well known that oxidation, thermal stress and chemical attack occur at such elevated temperatures in the blast furnace hearth wall. This paper discuss these root causes of hearth failure in more detail and suggest how these should be taken in consideration when selecting refractory materials and designing hearth walls for best performance in modern high productivity blast furnaces, in line with steel companies’ continuous drive for better results...|$|R
