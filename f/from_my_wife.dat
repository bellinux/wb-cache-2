2500|$|Having {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as {{principal}} tenor {{at the beginning}} of the 1975–76 season, Shovelton initially played [...] Tolloller in Iolanthe, Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard, and later that season added the roles of Luiz in The Gondoliers and the Duke of Dunstable in Patience. In 1977 he added to his repertoire the roles of Cyril in Princess Ida and Box in Cox and Box when those works were revived. He played the Defendant in a special performance of Trial by Jury in 1978 at London's Middle Temple Hall to commemorate the Bar Musical Society's first hundred concerts. In April 1979 he left D'Oyly Carte to tour with several other former D'Oyly Carte singers in a group that he founded, The Gilbert and Sullivan Companions, and he took other singing assignments. In 1980, he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, continuing with them until the company closed in February 1982. Shovelton recalled the [...] "family spirit" [...] of the company, writing that this was necessary in a year-round touring company where [...] "singing takes me away <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and three young children for extended periods". Shovelton's first marriage was eventually annulled; the couple's children were Claire, Dominic and Bruno. During these years, he also appeared at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival in 1977, among a few other concert appearances for various charities, also sometimes designing artwork for the benefits.|$|E
