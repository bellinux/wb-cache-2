5|$|Pharmacists {{involved}} in CPAs may participate in clinical {{services that are}} outside of the traditional scope of practice <b>for</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> Notably, pharmacists {{do not need to}} participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder <b>for</b> <b>pharmacists</b> to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan (PCP) {{approved}} {{the awarding of}} a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), a five-year professional degree. This {{was followed by the}} Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), approved by the Pakistan Physical Therapy Association (PPTA) in 2010. The use of the title of Doctor by pharmacists and physiotherapists holding these degrees is disputed. In March 2015, the PCP affirmed its use by holders of the PharmD, following a similar affirmation in November 2014 by the Punjab Pharmacy Council. However the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) issued a directive in July 2015 barring pharmacists and physiotherapists from using the title.

This may involve prescribing activities, which include selecting and initiating medications {{for the treatment of}} a patient's diagnosed illnesses (as outlined in the CPA), discontinuing the use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, modifying a patient's drug therapy (e.g. changing the strength, frequency, route of drug administration, or duration of therapy), evaluating a patient's response to drug therapy (which may include ordering and performing laboratory tests, such as a basic metabolic panel), and continuing drug therapy (providing a new prescription).|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the influence of demographics on patient preferences <b>for</b> community <b>pharmacist</b> attire. Methods: A 10 -item questionnaire was developed and administered to patients visiting a chain pharmacy or an independent pharmacy in the Birmingham, Alabama metropolitan area. Mann– Whitney was used to examine if statistical differences existed in chain versus independent pharmacy patient’s selections based on pharmacist attire. Results: A statistically significant difference in patient preference <b>for</b> <b>pharmacist</b> attire between the settings in regards to which pharmacist patients felt was more approachable was observed; 51. 2 % of chain pharmacy respondents compared to 30 % of independent pharmacy respondents identified the pharmacist pair with business formal attire and white coat as more approachable. Differences in education was also apparent with 70 % of respondents in the independent pharmacy setting reporting having a Bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 45 % of respondents in the chain pharmacy setting. Conclusion: With the exception of approachability, patients indicated preference <b>for</b> <b>pharmacist</b> with the white coat regardless of community setting. Given the importance of patient-pharmacist communication for building successful patient-pharmacist relationships, if patients do not perceive the pharmacists as approachable, communication and subsequent development of said relationships may not occur regardless of perceived knowledge and competency...|$|R

40|$|Obstetrics {{services}} are a high-throughput and high-risk environment poised <b>for</b> <b>pharmacist</b> involvement, but determining how to ideally allocate services is difficult. There is recent {{interest in the}} development of tools for service prioritisation, but none are specifically targeted to obstetrics. Therefore, the aim of this study was (1) to conduct a practice audit surveying the demographics of patients attending obstetrics wards at a high-capacity maternity hospital, and (2) to evaluate a triage tool developed to prioritise pharmacy services. A retrospective case review of women discharged after birth admissions was undertaken at a hospital in National Health Service (NHS) Scotland during June 2014. Demographic and admission data were collected, as well as pharmacist interventions and missed opportunities in patient care on postnatal wards. A pharmacy triage tool was developed and retrospectively applied to each case to ascertain a risk category that would trigger and target pharmacist review. Interventions/opportunities were classified as either clinical (medication-related) or administrative (potential for error development). 175 cases were reviewed with a median age of 29 years old. Eighty-six patients (49. 1 %) were retrospectively classified with elevated risk using the triage tool. A total of 117 charts (66. 9 %) were identified with missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>pharmacist</b> intervention, which was significantly higher among patients classified as higher risk (75. 6 vs. 58. 4 %, p= 0. 017). Compared to low risk patients, patients with a higher risk classification had lower rates of administrative missed opportunities (55. 4 vs. 80. 8 %, p= 0. 015), but numerically higher rates of clinical (26. 2 vs. 9. 6 %, p=NS) and mixed clinical/administrative (18. 5 vs. 9. 6 %, p=NS) missed opportunities, although this failed to reach statistical significance. Evaluation of a triage tool for obstetric services demonstrated potential for prioritising higher risk patients <b>for</b> <b>pharmacist</b> review and addressing opportunities for clinical improvements...|$|R
