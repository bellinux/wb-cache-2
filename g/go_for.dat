Following a final EP for Touch and Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to Touch and <b>Go,</b> <b>for</b> a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release.

5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} can <b>go</b> <b>for</b> longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number}} of abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{the efforts}} of Filipino and American {{defenders}} during the Battle of Bataan were widely covered by the press, as were {{the actions of the}} 100th and 442nd Infantry.

By contrast, the activities of the Filipino Infantry Regiment and her sister units were largely unpublicized; {{it was not until the}} documentaries Unsung Heroes and An UnTold Triumph that any significant visual media covered the history of the Regiment. In 1984 an association of veterans of the Regiment erected a marker in Salinas in honor of their former unit.|$|E

The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E

Many people enjoy short walks and longer hikes to waterfalls in Yosemite Valley, or walks among giant sequoias in the Mariposa, Tuolumne, or Merced Groves.

5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E
