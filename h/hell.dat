5|$|In a {{research}} facility on Mars {{owned by the}} Union Aerospace Corporation, facility director Samuel Hayden's mind now inhabits an android body after having lost his original to brain cancer. Researchers attempted to draw energy from <b>Hell</b> in order to solve an energy crisis on Earth using the Argent Tower, which siphons energy and allows travel to and from <b>Hell.</b> Hayden has already led multiple expeditions into <b>Hell,</b> bringing back captive demons and artifacts for study. One artifact was a sarcophagus containing the Doom Slayer (along with his Praetor Suit), whom the demons imprisoned after his earlier rampage through <b>Hell.</b>|$|E

5|$|At <b>Hell,</b> there arose a {{disagreement}} {{about where the}} Hell–Sunnan Line should branch from the Meråker Line. Initial proposals were to place the branch from a location before <b>Hell</b> Station, thus forcing trains to back up from <b>Hell</b> Station before continuing northwards. The station building at <b>Hell</b> was also {{too small for the}} increased traffic, so it was moved to Sunnan Station and a new station building, with capacity for 25 employees, was built at <b>Hell.</b> In Skatval, there was a controversy as to whether the station should be built at Mæhre or Alstad. Mæhre (later Skatval) had support from the municipal council and was closer to the larger share of the area's population. However, the military wanted Alstad, as it was a rally point for the military in case of a Swedish invasion, and gave easy waterway access from Frosta. The station was placed at Mæhre, while a passing loop was built at Alstad.|$|E

5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to <b>hell,</b> an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to <b>hell</b> without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to <b>hell</b> and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to <b>hell.</b> Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

25|$|Crowd {{management}} {{proved to}} be difficult, resulting in both spectator injury and death. Over {{the course of the}} day, the <b>Hells</b> Angels became increasingly agitated as the crowd turned more aggressive. At a later murder trial of <b>Hells</b> Angel Alan Passaro, a security guard testified he heard the <b>Hells</b> Angels being summoned over the loudspeakers when the helicopter bearing The Rolling Stones landed. Debate after the event was over whether the <b>Hells</b> Angels were to manage security for the entire concert or just for The Rolling Stones. Sam Cutler, the Stones' agent who had arranged to pay the <b>Hells</b> Angels said their role was as bodyguards to the Rolling Stones. This was denied by the <b>Hells</b> Angels as well as others connected to the event. During the opening act of Santana, the <b>Hells</b> Angels surged into the crowd numerous times to keep persons off stage.|$|R
