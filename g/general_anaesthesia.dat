40|$|International audienceBackground: The ADARPEF (French-Language Society of Paediatric Anaesthesiologists) {{designed}} a one-year prospective, multicenter and anonymous study {{in order to}} update both epidemiology and morbidity of regional anaesthesia in children. Methods: From November 2005 to October 2006, data from participating hospitals were recorded using an identification form, a data recording form and a complication form. Information collected included {{the characteristics of the}} hospitals, the number and type of regional anaesthetics, the age of the involved children as well as the incidence and type of complications. Results: Data collected in 47 institutions included 104, 612 pure <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesias,</b> 29, 870 <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesias</b> associated with regional blocks and 1, 262 pure regional blocks. Central blocks accounted for 34 % of all RA. Peripheral blocks (66 %) were upper or lower limb blocks (29 % of peripheral blocks), trunk and face blocks (71 %). In children aged ≤ 3 yr, the percentage of central blocks was similar to the peripheral ones (45 % versus 55), while in older children, peripheral blocks were more than four times used that peripheral ones. Complications (41 involving 40 patients) were rare and usually minor. They did not result in any sequelae. The study revealed an overall rate of complication of 0. 12 %; CI 95 % [0. 09 - 0. 17], significantly 6 times higher for central that for peripheral blocks. Conclusions: Due to the low rate of complications, regional anaesthetic techniques have a good safety profile and can be used in order to provide postoperative analgesia. In addition, the results should encourage anaesthesiologists to continue to use peripheral instead central (including caudal) blocks as often as possible when appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Study Type [...] Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. What's {{known on}} the subject? and What does the study add? Vasectomy {{reversal}} is often performed in <b>general</b> or neuraxial <b>anaesthesia.</b> Even though {{the site of}} vasectomy reversal is easily amenable to regional/local anaesthesia, spermatic cord blocks are rarely applied because of their risk of vascular damage within the spermatic cord. Recently, we described the technique of ultrasonography (US) -guided spermatic cord block for scrotal surgery, which, thanks to the US guidance, {{at the same time}} avoids the risk of vascular damage of blindly performed injections and the risks of <b>general</b> and neuraxial <b>anaesthesia.</b> Vasectomy reversal can easily be done in regional anaesthesia with the newly described technique of US-guided spermatic cord block without the risks of vascular damage by a blindly performed injection and the risks of standard <b>general</b> and neuraxial <b>anaesthesia.</b> In addition, this technique grants long-lasting postoperative pain relief and patients recover more quickly.

25|$|Surgical post-mastectomy breast {{reconstruction}} requires <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> {{cuts the}} chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign {{object to the}} patient's body (see capsular contracture). The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.|$|E
25|$|A rhinoplastic {{correction}} can {{be performed}} on {{a person who is}} under sedation, under <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> or under local anaesthesia; initially, a local anaesthetic mixture of lidocaine and epinephrine is injected to numb the area, and temporarily reduce vascularity, thereby limiting any bleeding. Generally, the plastic surgeon first separates the nasal skin and the soft tissues from the osseo-cartilagenous nasal framework, and then corrects (reshapes) them as required, afterwards, sutures the incisions, and then applies either an external or an internal stent, and tape, to immobilize the newly reconstructed nose, and so facilitate the healing of the surgical cuts. Occasionally, the surgeon uses either an autologous cartilage graft or a bone graft, or both, in order to strengthen or to alter the nasal contour(s). The autologous grafts usually are harvested from the nasal septum, but, if it has insufficient cartilage (as can occur in a revision rhinoplasty), then either a costal cartilage graft (from the rib cage) or an auricular cartilage graft (concha from the ear) is harvested from the patient’s body. When the rhinoplasty requires a bone graft, it is harvested from either the cranium, the hips, or the rib cage; moreover, when neither type of autologous graft is available, a synthetic graft (nasal implant) is used to augment the nasal bridge.|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} changes in haemodynamic variables {{before and during}} transurethral resection of the prostate in 22 patients under <b>general</b> or spinal <b>anaesthesia.</b> In the <b>general</b> anaesthetic group {{there was a significant}} decrease in cardiac output (mean 32 % (SEM 5 %)) and mean arterial pressure (14 % (3 %)) after induction of anaesthesia and a sig-nificant decrease (27 % (3 %)) in heart rate before the start of resection. Otherwise, variables remained close to baseline values. In the subarachnoid block group, mean arterial pressure decreased after induc-tion (16 % (2 %)), but overall variables remained unchanged.

25|$|Edward William Archibald {{was born}} on August 5, 1872 in Montreal, Quebec to father John Sprott Archibald and mother Ellen Hutchison. The young Edward's family had moved around a great deal before he was born, with his {{ancestors}} first living in Scotland, then moving through Ireland, New Hampshire, Nova Scotia and eventually Quebec. His parents insisted that all their children experience a foreign culture experience, with {{the added benefit of}} becoming bilingual. To this end, the young Archibald was sent to Grenoble, France by his parents to study upon reaching adolescence. In 1888, after returning to Canada, Archibald entered the McGill University Faculty of Arts, graduating from there with a Bachelor of Arts in 1892. He continued at McGill, entering medical school and graduating with a Doctor of Medicine in 1896. There, he became interested in the medical specialisation field of surgery, and although the invention of <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and other technological improvements made surgery a fast-moving field, Archibald said that he opted to become a surgeon due to the logic involved and the application of theoretical knowledge in practice. The young doctor began his surgical career with a three-year program at McGill University, with what was essentially an apprenticeship in the field at Royal Victoria Hospital, which had opened only a few years earlier. Archibald also spent a year in Europe, where he studied under the guidance of Ludwig Aschoff and Jan Mikulicz-Radecki. He was impressed the most by the surgical methods of the latter, which were groundbreaking for the time.|$|E

40|$|Background and objectives. In total {{intravenous}} anaesthesia 2 different application modes for propofol are widely used: 1. infusion {{by means of}} manually controlled infusion pumps, and 2. infusion by means of microprocessor-controlled infusion pumps operating according to pharmacokinetic algorithms (TCI = target controlled infusion). The parallel use of these 2 methods in our department by various anaesthetists offered the opportunity to retrospectively compare both application patterns regarding clinical effects and drug consumption. Methods. Ninety-six <b>anaesthesia</b> records from <b>general</b> <b>anaesthesias</b> with propofol and opioids from gynaecological laparoscopic operations were retrospectively evaluated. Forty-eight records derived from 6 anaesthetists using manual propofol infusion (retrospective allocation to group C), and 48 other records derived from 6 anaesthetists using TCI infusion (retrospective allocation to group M). We assessed the intra-operative hemodynamic course, drug consumption, awakening time and post-operative side effects. Results. The awakening time after TCI was significantly shorter than after manual propofol infusion (M: 4, 9 ± 3. 1 min vs. C: 9, 9 ± 5. 7 min). We observed a non-significantly rarer occurrence of post-operative side effects such as PONV and pain. Only insignificant differences in drug consumption could be found. Conclusions. Both observed application patterns for propofol showed similar clinical profiles. Using TCI, awakening time was 5 min earlier than with manual infusion mode, thus showing a potential pharmaco-economical advantage in anesthesias for gynecological laparoscopy.
