5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

5000|$|Megumi {{also works}} at Kiri Pro, and is Komugi's bitter rival. Megumi, unlike Komugi, has much sex appeal, {{and she is}} often the one to tease Komugi about <b>her</b> flat <b>chest,</b> to which Komugi retorts with an insult such as [...] "Hooter's Girl" [...] to insult <b>her</b> {{enormous}} <b>chest.</b> Megumi is an image girl, posing for center folds and posters, although she also {{has an interest in}} acting.|$|R
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> and right knee.|$|E
5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in <b>her</b> <b>chest,</b> allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through the}} aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in <b>her</b> <b>chest</b> where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E

5000|$|She was [...] "like a fresh breeze" [...] {{wherever}} she went and could, wrote a friend, grasp {{the subject of}} a discussion in [...] "a few minutes' airy inattention". Unlike her husband, she was a notoriously untidy person, habitually leaving her letters strewn {{on the floor in the}} well-founded faith that someone would eventually pick them up and post them. <b>Her</b> <b>chests</b> of drawers were similarly messy, and she was rarely much bothered with fancy attire. [...] "What a bore you would have been," [...] she teased her husband, [...] "if you had married someone as tidy as you are." ...|$|R

5|$|After the Empire Games, the Australian team {{returned}} home via France, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Singapore {{for a series}} of competitions. Morgan's best performances were at the Dutch and French Championships, where she came third in the 400-metre events. In 1959, she placed third in both the 440-yard and 880-yard freestyle events at the Australian Championships. Her swimming career was then interrupted by bronchitis, which developed into bronchial pneumonia. The illness forced her to take an extended break. <b>Her</b> <b>chest</b> problems persisted when she returned to competition at the 1960 Australian Championships, placing third in the 220-yard and 440-yard freestyle and fifth in the 110-yard freestyle. She gained selection for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome {{as a member of the}} 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad. She swam the first leg in the heats, posting a time of 1 minute 5.5 seconds, giving Australia a 1.0-second lead. Australia led at every change and went on to win its heat by five seconds, qualifying fastest for the final. However, Morgan posted the slowest leg of the Australian quartet and was dropped when Fraser and Konrads were brought into the team for the final, in which Australia won silver. Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not awarded medals if the final quartet placed in the top three positions. Suffering from periodic chest pain, Morgan retired from competitive swimming in December 1960.|$|E

30|$|A 34 -year-old female was the {{restrained}} {{passenger in}} a high-speed motor vehicle collision. On arrival to the Emergency Department she was alert and complaining {{of pain in}} <b>her</b> left <b>chest</b> and abdomen. <b>Her</b> initial vital signs were the following: blood pressure 80 / 45, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 18, and saturation was 96 % on 15  l of oxygen. Her physical exam was remarkable for profound tenderness in <b>her</b> left <b>chest</b> and abdomen, with abrasions but no gross deformity or crepitus. A bedside ultrasound (extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma) was performed, and the following images were obtained of her left upper quadrant.|$|R

25|$|Décolletage {{was often}} {{a feature of the}} dress of the late Middle Ages. This {{continued}} through the Victorian period.
