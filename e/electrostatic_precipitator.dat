25|$|An <b>{{electrostatic}}</b> <b>precipitator</b> (ESP), or electrostatic {{air cleaner}} is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using {{the force of}} an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In 1907, the California physicist Frederick G. Cottrell invented and received a patent for the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{induction}} is {{also used}} for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection.In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> to Spray painting or Inkjet printing.|$|E
25|$|Recovery boilers also {{improved}} the smelt removal. It is removed {{directly from the}} furnace through smelt spouts into a dissolving tank. Some of the first recovery units employed the use of Cottrellâ€™s <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> for dust recovery.|$|E
40|$|Stricter {{environmental}} legislation {{in many countries}} is producing standards governing the emission of fine particles to the atmosphere from all sources. The industrial separating particles from process streams have numerous methods with different principles. In <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> is used electrical charge of dust particles. There are many aspects of pollution control in both solid and liquid phase using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators.</b> The operation of plate-type <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitators</b> {{is closely related to}} its electrical energization, to obtain high collection efficiency with low electrical energization consumption.

Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure.

2500|$|Another problem {{related to}} coal {{combustion}} is the emission of particulates {{that have a}} serious impact on public health. [...] Power plants remove particulate from the flue gas {{with the use of}} a bag house or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator.</b> Several newer plants that burn coal use a different process, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle in which synthesis gas is made out of a reaction between coal and water. The synthesis gas is processed to remove most pollutants and then used initially to power gas turbines. Then the hot exhaust gases from the gas turbines are used to generate steam to power a steam turbine. The pollution levels of such plants are drastically lower than those of [...] "classic" [...] coal power plants.|$|E
