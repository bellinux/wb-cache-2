500|$|Tina's {{cover of}} [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] stirred mixed {{emotions}} in Gonzalez. She criticized the ending: [...] "When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable." [...] However, {{she liked the}} earlier part of the performance, and wrote, [...] "It was Ã¼bersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have gotten choked up with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Evancho {{appeared}} in the feature film The Company You Keep, a 2013 political thriller. She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> like {{to do something with}} a Disney special or make a movie once in a while that would give me enough time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|He remains {{interested}} {{in history and}} {{said in an interview}} with The Observer that [...] "I can see myself in a few years' time joining the National Trust and going round the odd castle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find that restful as the anger of middle-age sets in." [...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E

6000|$|... "A pity," [...] said Godwin, as {{they dragged}} his horse away. [...] "Had they left us alone <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> brother, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have saved you a {{moonlight}} duel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{exceptions}} to every rule," [...] Lord Keith said, [...] "and as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> overstep the line. Could he pass?" ...|$|R
500|$|Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings {{used the}} St. Johns as a {{backdrop}} in her books South Moon Under and The Yearling, and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river's ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled [...] "Hyacinth Drift" [...] in her memoir Cross Creek {{that she had the}} best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated. Rawlings wrote, [...] "If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{improvements}} to governance still left {{plenty of room}} for profiteering. As Mark Twain wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, [...] "The government of my country snubs honest simplicity, but fondles artistic villainy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two." [...] "Territorial rings", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Indian tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Long {{was arrested}} on November 16, 1984, and charged with the sexual battery and {{kidnapping}} of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal Miranda waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused {{on a series of}} unsolved sexual battery homicides pending in the area. As the detectives began to question Long about the murders, he replied, [...] "I'd rather not answer that." [...] The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, [...] "The complexion of things sure have changed since you came back into the room. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> need an attorney." [...] No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do better," [...] said Amos. [...] "We might bait a trap {{for them}} there. Where is this powder {{of which you}} spoke?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> buy such {{little things}} as {{that would come}} to, of myself," [...] said Rollo. [...] "Suppose I should wish to buy {{a small piece of}} {{gingerbread}} for a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{pretend to}} {{know very little}} of these feelings, Miss Eve. I have been wooed, I acknowledge; and once <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have been tempted to marry, {{had it not been}} for a {{particular}} circumstance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{as well as}} I ought; but"--lowering {{his voice}} for her ear alone, he added, [...] "under proper {{instruction}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> learn." ...|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} stop it. Will you slip {{round to}} Dawker's--it's not five minutes--and ask him to come and see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are most}} kind," [...] said Sybil, [...] "but if I {{could get back}} to the town through Mowbray Park, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do {{something}} for my father!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do that, count. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall in {{any case}} report myself to the king; but if Lindsay were {{stationed}} at any place I could pass through, {{on my way to}} Breslau, I would pick up Karl and my horse." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mir. As of the gayest thing I ever saw, [...] So fine, that it {{appeared}} more {{fit to be}} [...] Beloved than feared, and seemed so near my kind, [...] That <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have called it sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready {{to pack up and}} follow you any day, Merton. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> assist you a little; at all events I shall try, and go about among the women and listen to what they say while you are {{listening}} to the men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know--it's what I WANT to know," [...] said Chad. [...] "And if I {{could have}} {{sufficiently}} wanted--by myself--to go back, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have found out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her carriage, not herself?" [...] said Edmund. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> go {{with you}} to her house, Marian, if your {{feathers}} are not ashamed of such shabby company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Hoseason to Alan, [...] "we'll {{try your}} way of it. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well trust to a blind fiddler. Pray God you're right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, mademoiselle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>might.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> it over. Of {{course there}} are difficulties, but I do not see why it should not succeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I {{shall be}} with the marshal again. It {{is a good deal}} more lively with him than it is with the king's staff; who, {{although}} no doubt excellent soldiers, are certainly not lively companions. I do hope there will be no great battle until we get there. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> start in a week." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the course}} of time I brought up on the {{starboard}} side of the pilot-house and found a sextant lying on a bench. Now, I said, they [...] "take the sun" [...] through this thing; <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> see that vessel through it. I had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on the shoulder and said deprecatingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Matteo, I shall {{try to get}} a few hours' sleep. I did {{not close}} my eyes last night, from the pain of my wounds, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> manage to drop off now." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{government}} {{of my country}} snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic villainy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two.|$|E
6000|$|... [Hesitatingly.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{tell you}} this. He had {{committed}} a grave error of judgment. We were entrapped by the Arabs, and our only chance of escape entailed the almost certain {{death of one}} of us.|$|E
6000|$|Third Objection. But {{since you}} follow the metaphor so close, I will suppose, if an {{advocate}} be entertained, some recompense must be given him. His fee-who shall pay him his fee? I have nothing. Could I {{do anything to make}} this advocate part of amends, <b>I</b> could <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have benefit from him; but I have nothing. What say you to this?32 ...|$|R
6000|$|I said, [...] "I'll {{have to get}} you {{to excuse}} me; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>might</b> write to suit you after a while; as soon as I had had some {{practice}} and learned the language I am confident I could. But, to speak the plain truth, that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences, and a man is liable to interruption.|$|R
5000|$|Regina Spektor, Randy Newman and Arcade Fire did {{ultimately}} submit {{material to}} the project, albeit later than expected. In an October 2011 interview published in Rolling Stone, Gabriel said, [...] "I've sort of given up waiting for the others ... So now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> try to find three or four other people to cover my stuff so that I can make an album out of that, and then get that out next year in some form." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she murmured, [...] "that {{you talk}} very nicely. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{even say that}} I like to hear you talk. But it is so useless. Won't you go now? Won't you please go now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it was a}} {{fair and}} square race sure enough," [...] {{answered}} Walt Baxter. [...] "All the same, if my skates had been just a little sharper <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have won," [...] he added a little wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, look you, Chevalier, I {{think the}} widow was not unpartial to me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have induced {{her to make}} our {{connection}} a little closer: and faith, though she is older than I am, she is the richest party now in England.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have {{no doubt}} that they could do that, and were it not for Carthew and his friend I would not {{hesitate}} to take eight men. I don't know about the other, but you may be sure that Carthew will fight hard. He is playing a desperate game. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> take four, especially as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the chance of Miss Greendale's being brought on board, until he believes that we have left these waters, is very small.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{live in the}} Albany!" [...] {{repeated}} St. Barbe, with an {{amazed and}} perturbed expression. [...] "I knew I {{could not be a}} knight of the garter, or a member of White's--the only two things an Englishman cannot command; but <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> some day live in the Albany. It was my dream. And you live there! Gracious! what an unfortunate fellow I am! I do not see how you can live in the Albany with your salary; I suppose they have raised you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so. And {{remember}} how I {{wanted to be}} a lawyer and go into politics? <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have made a go of it. I've kind of got the gift of the gab--anyway, <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> on my feet, and make some kind of a spiel on most anything, and of course that's the thing you need in politics. By golly, Ted's going to law-school, even if I didn't! Well--I guess it's worked out all right. Myra's been a fine wife. And Zilla means well, Paulibus." ...|$|R
