40|$|Usually, {{there are}} two types of fishing lamp used by bagan {{fisherman}} to attract and catch fish: pressured kerosene lamp and electric lamp. The first type is commonly used on the small sized bagan like raft bagan in Pelabuhan Ratu Bay and the second type is used on the large bagan like boat bagan (known as "bagan rambo" in south Sulawesi) in Makassar strait. 	The pattern of light intensity distribution of both fishing lamps in the air was almost the same, i. e., is butterfly shaped. The highest intensity was recorded at the angle of 90,??? i. e., 170 lx for kerosene and 2, 700 lx for mercury lamps. The pattern of the underwater light intensity was found different between the bagan. Due to the pattern of light position and lighting power, mercury lamps can illuminate deeper water column than pressured kerosene lamp. At 8 m depth The underwater illumination of boat bagan and raft bagan were 47 lx and 0. 1 lx, respectively. 	The catch of both bagan was dominated by anchovy Stolephorus sp. The others species caught are spotted sardinella Sardinella sirm, scad mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, <b>fringe-scale</b> sardine <b>Sardinella</b> fimbriata, black tipped ponyfish Leiognathus splendens, squid Loligo sp and stripped mackerel Rastreliger kanagurta. Skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis and barred spanis mackerel Scomberomorus commersoni were only caught by boat bagan. It is supposed that boat bagan was operated in the off-shore waters. The average catch per trip of boat bagan was 180 kg whereas for raft bagan was 30 kg...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the sardine fish species availability which captured in artisanal and industrial fishing sector during January, 2012 to December, 2012 from the onshore and off shore water areas of our marine water and total production of sardines was 7352. 99 MT, among this 1747. 22 MT was exploited by the coastal mechanize boats in inshore areas which contributed 23. 76 % by weight of total sardine fish production and 5605. 77 MT harvested from different industrial fish trawlers and contributed 76. 24 % to the total sardine landing in deep-sea fisheries and 17. 51 % contributed to the total fish production by commercial fish trawlers at the same study period. Still now 4 sardine species are recorded in the Bangladesh region of the Bay of Bengal. Among them, two sardine species are abundantly available and they are, <b>Fringe-scale</b> sardine- <b>Sardinella</b> fimbriata is locally call as ‘sagar chapila’ and its total landing volume was 5495. 79 MT (74. 74 %) of the total landed sardines in artisanal and industrial fishing; of which contributed 31. 79 % (1747. 22 MT) in artisanal and 68. 21 % (3748. 57 MT) from industrial sector to the total production volumes of S. fimbriata. And the rain bow sardine-Dussumieria acuta call as ‘Colombo machh’, this contributed 25. 26 % (1857. 20 MT) only in industrial fishing sector in our sampling period. Generally, in artisanal fishing the peak capture season of sardine species, S. fimbriata is in the rainy season and in industrial fishing major harvesting season of S. fimbriata are the end of late autumn to first of winter in night times. D. acuta harvest only in industrial fishing and peak production season is in the winter season and highest catch observed {{at night in the}} full moon and new moon period and a few days after and before full moon and new moon. S. fimbriata are exploits within 10 - 20 meters depth and abundantly available {{in the southern part of}} the South patches and South of south patches and capture 40 - 50 m depth in north-west to north-east of Middle ground (Kohinoor point) and D. acuta are harvest within 40 - 60 m. depth and available in the north-west to north-east of Middle ground areas (Kohinoor point) and south-west to south-east of Middle ground (Kohinoor point) in the Bangladesh region of the Bay of Bengal. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of S. fimbriata was 171. 28 kg observed in artisanal fishing. Average CPUE was 172. 50 kg in the selected fish landing center of Shahparir dwep followed by 198. 77 kg, 257. 77 kg, 189. 88 kg, 115. 66 kg and 93. 10 kg were at Teknaf sadar, Shamlapur, Moheskhali, BFDC fish harbour, Cox’s Bazar and Fishery ghat fish landing center in Chittagong district respectively. In industrial fishing average CPUE was 772. 68 kg recorded at the same sampling period...|$|R
