50|$|A typical male prairie vole {{displays}} a rather timid behavior during daily interactions. However, these individuals become aggressive after mating with a female, especially towards another male. The study's {{results indicated that}} the vole males that were injected with vasopressin blocker remained timid and displayed behavior similar to polygamous voles. Polygamous voles have a significantly smaller number of vasopressin receptors and remain shy even after mating. Thus, the scientists concluded that vasopressin is responsible for the aggressive behavior in male prairie voles. After further testing, they also concluded that vasopressin is also responsible for <b>forming</b> <b>attachment</b> between the male and a female of his choice.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to raise}} {{awareness}} of vicarious trauma amongst disaster researchers, and suggests ways to prevent vicarious traumatisation from happening and/or reaching incapacitating levels. The paper examines the potential of mindfulness practice, grounded in Buddhist meditation, as a set of contemplation tools through which optimal level of functionality can be maintained or restored. The relevance of the emphasis in mindfulness on understanding suffering, non-attachment, non-judgement, and full participation in the present moment are related to the context of disaster research. The paper demonstrates the potential for increased researcher resilience through acknowledgement and understanding of impermanence, as well as skilful observation of external and internal phenomena in trauma without <b>forming</b> <b>attachment</b> to the pain and suffering...|$|E
40|$|Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) is a {{condition}} which results in indi-viduals having difficulty forming loving, lasting, intimate relationships [1]. Attachment Disorders vary in severity, but the term is usually reserved for individuals who show a nearly complete lack of ability to be genuinely affec-tionate with others. They typically fail to develop a conscience and do not learn how to trust. RAD is found in children who have had difficulties in <b>forming</b> <b>attachment</b> with their primary care-giver or have had this relation-ship severely disrupted in some way. Genetic influences may also contribute since children who have suffered very adverse early experiences do not all de-velop RAD [2]. Present research concentrates on identifying causal effects to aid early diagnosis. Methods Data were collected from parent reports on 8 -year-olds using a Relationship Problems Questionnaire (RPQ). The sample consisted of {{a subset of the}} Twins Early Development Study (TEDS; [3]), which is a longitudinal study that ha...|$|E

The finding of 'adhesion pedestals', which represents a cellular {{response to the}} presence of the organism, is analogous to the response of intestinal cells to enteropathogenic E coli. Thus the development of bacterial attachment sites in H pylori associated gastritis might be an indication of pathogenicity. We have therefore explored the relationship between the proportion of organisms <b>forming</b> <b>attachment</b> sites and histological indices of disease 'activity'. Antral biopsies from 40 patients with H pylori positive gastritis were examined histologically and ultrastructurally, and the percentage of attached organisms compared with subjective assessments of epithelial degeneration, mucin depletion, polymorphonuclear and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. We found {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of attached bacteria in cases showing histological epithelial degeneration, and a significant decrease in cases showing intraepithelial polymorph infiltration. The direct relationship between bacterial attachment and cellular degeneration lends further support to a pathogenic effect. Reduced attachment in the face of polymorph infiltration might indirectly reflect aspects of the immune response [...] namely, blocking of adhesion by IgA, with complement activation and generation of leucotactic factors...|$|E

40|$|When {{being placed}} into more benign environments like foster care, {{children}} from adverse rearing backgrounds {{are capable of}} <b>forming</b> <b>attachment</b> relationships to new caregivers within {{the first year of}} placement, while certain problematic social behaviors appear to be more persistent. Assuming that early averse experiences shape neural circuits underlying social behavior, neurophysiological studies on individual differences in early social-information processing have great informative value. More precisely, ERP studies have repeatedly shown face processing to be sensitive to experience especially regarding the caregiving background. However, studies on effects of early adverse caregiving experiences are restricted to children with a history of institutionalization. Also, no study has investigated effects of attachment security as a marker {{of the quality of the}} caregiver-child relationship. Thus, the current study asks how adverse caregiving experiences and attachment security to (new) caregivers affect early- and mid-latency ERPs sensitive to facial familiarity processing. Therefore, pre-school aged foster children during their second year within the foster home were compared to an age matched control group. Attachment was assessed using the AQS and neurophysiological data was collected during a passive viewing task presenting (foster) mother and stranger faces. Foster children were comparable to the control group with regard to attachment security. On a neurophysiological level, however, the foster group showed dampened N 170 amplitudes for both face types. In both foster and control children, dampened N 170 amplitudes were also found for stranger as compared to (foster) mother faces, and, for insecurely attached children as compared to securely attached children. This neural pattern may be viewed as a result of poorer social interactions earlier in life. Still, there was no effect on P 1 amplitudes. Indicating heightened attentional processing, Nc amplitude responses to stranger faces were found to be enhanced in foster as compared to control children. Also, insecurely attached children allocated more attentional resources for the neural processing of mother faces. The study further confirms that early brain development is highly sensitive to the quality of caregiving. The findings are also relevant from a developmental perspective as miswiring of neural circuits may possibly play a critical role in children's psycho-social adjustment...|$|E
