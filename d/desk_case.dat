Preparing enough amounts of contents for help desk system is important for constructing an efficient help desk system. However, the preparation of contents is a hard job for contents-creators (usually, who is an expert of the work.). To support making help desk contents, we developed "Procedure based help desk system". Primary functions of this system are to easily generate help desk contents about software usage (They will be called as "procedure data".). Then the system classifies procedure data and constructs procedure database. Also the system provides useful functions to refer accumulated procedure data.

40|$|A common {{approach}} to prioritising investment opportunities (for example, scientific projects) is to sort {{them in some}} sort of value for money ordering, that is to say in terms of a ratio /i iv c where vi is a measure of value of a project, and ci {{is a measure of the}} input cost, with i a project index from K={ 1,…, k}.

40|$|China {{has been}} on the road towards a {{transition}} from a centrally planned economy to a market economy since 1978. The rapid industrialization and urbanization has put significant pressure on the environment. Water pollution in China is developing from traditional pollution with conventional pollutants to a compound type of pollution with new and old pollutants interacting with each other, and from a pollution-dominant industry to the coexistence of industrial pollution and agricultural pollution. Traditional water management schemes are not able to meet these challenges. Water resource management, in order to adapt to the new situation, is therefore being reformed.

40|$|Exploratory Research into Transformation Processes of Former Industrial Complexes of Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei (Leipzig) and Mattatoio di Testaccio (Rome); New Meanings of Industrial Heritage Physical {{manifestations of}} the Industrial Revolution left a {{permanent}} imprint on the complexion of cities. Abandonment that followed the deindustrialization contributed to an estrangement, turning derelict industrial spaces and run‐down factories into a ballast to conjure with. At present, industrial heritage management applies flexibility and creativity, partially overcoming the essentially traditional paradigm of heritage preservation. This approach permits sustainable conservation – utilization and integration of disused industrial constructs in the contemporary urban landscape. Being {{a part of the}} European cultural stock, industrial heritage is an exciting and unique setting from many perspectives. It is defined and consumed by many markets, ranging from the industrial heritage tourism to the market of special events and festivals. Reused industrial buildings and factories come into view as products of post‐industrial societies, fitting to the Western post‐industrial (consumer) culture, offering a field of activities that are at an interface between the industrial history and contemporary socio‐cultural milieu. Alteration of values, growth of new roles and definitions of industrial heritage, generated by functional restructuring, is a subject which is often left behind the general discussion about sustainable conservation and adaptive reuse of industrial heritage. Yet, in the modified state, industrial heritage is very complex to understand and to define. By conducting a <b>desk</b> and a <b>case</b> study research of former industrial complexes – Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei and Mattatoio di Testaccio, this doctoral thesis aims to identify industrial heritage as a contemporary (post‐industrial) concept.

40|$|The {{electrification}} {{ratio of}} Sumba Island has been {{increased in the}} past five years from about 24. 5 % in 2010 to about 43 % 2015 in which 55 % of the share supplied by renewable energy resources (Hivos, 2015). Despite the progress on electrification ratio, there are still about 238 out of 433 villages which do not have electricity access (PLN, 2017). It is because some of these villages are located in remote areas which have limited access to infrastructures, such as roads and grid access. Currently, the rural households in Sumba Island use fossil fuel to provide their electricity needs. However, the use of fossil fuel is considered polluting, noisy, and expensive. Thus, renewable energy-based power generation needs to be introduced. While wind and hydropower could be very attractive for grid-connected options, off-grid solar Photovoltaic (PV) Systems stand out as the best solution for off-grid electrification because of Sumba’s dispersed population and limited infrastructure. Several off-grid PV projects have been carried out by the government as well as private institutions. However, the adoption of off-grid PV technologies for Sumba’s rural areas remains very slow. From the literature, it is known that the role of business model to overcome challenges of the adoption of off-grid PV electrification in rural areas is considered important. However, there is still no literature which explains how a sustainable business model helps to overcome the barriers faced by PV projects in the rural energy market. An exploratory study using <b>desk</b> research and <b>cases</b> study from seven different PV companies are used to understand how PV companies choose types of business models to address the challenges in the rural energy market. Then, this insight will be used to develop advices on business models for PV companies who want to operate their business in the rural energy market in Sumba Island, Indonesia. In this study, We developed a framework which explains the linkage between the barriers faced by PV companies in rural areas in developing countries and how the business model could help the companies to overcome these barriers. By using this framework, we discovered suitable business models which could be implemented by PV companies in rural areas in Sumba Island. Firstly, it is the distributor model which offers various PV products. Secondly, it is the distributor model which offers electricity services delivered by a microgrid. Finally, study limitations and recommended future studies were offered to improve the framework developed from this study. Sustainable Energy TechnologyEnergy and Societ...|$|R
40|$|In {{high-tech}} industries, projects play {{a central}} role in the development of new products and processes. Since these projects can be quite complex, it would be useful to look at where complexity in projects comes from and how these complexities influence these projects. The research project described in this thesis aims to increase the understanding of this topic in a company in the semiconductor industry, NXP Semiconductors. Products that are produced in the semiconductor industry play an increasingly important role in our lives. Products ranging from mobile telephones to cars to lighting are all equipped with semiconductor products and the performance of these products is steadily increasing with time. Therefore, the development of these products and the processes, which are needed to produce the products, are becoming more complex. The research project To describe the complexities that are encountered in the process engineering industry, a framework (the TOE framework, where TOE stands for Technical, Organizational and External) was developed earlier. The TOE framework consists of 47 elements (which are categorized into the three aforementioned categories) that describe aspects that can contribute to a project’s complexity. To understand the complexities that are encountered in the semiconductor industry, this research project has applied the TOE framework to this industry. The goal of this research project is twofold: firstly, it aims to understand where complexities in projects in the semiconductor industry come from; secondly, it would be useful for the company if the company would be able to understand which complexities could play a role in a future project and this could be used to come with the right measures to cope with these complexities. The main research question that this research project aims to answer is: What benefits does the application of the TOE framework provide for projects at NXP? This question is answered by doing a combination of <b>desk</b> research and <b>case</b> studies on projects in the company. In the desk research phase, the current practice related to development projects at NXP is investigated and a tool is described that calculates the design complexity of a new product design: Numetrics. Case studies To understand what complexities play a role in NXP projects, 16 projects have been investigated. The projects that are studied are from a wide variety of departments within NXP, but all projects (except for one) involve development of a new product or process. From each project, one person (the project manager) was interviewed. During the interviews, these project managers were asked to explain what the project entailed, which complexities were encountered during the projects, what influence these complexities had on the project and how the project managers coped with the complexities. The project managers were asked to indicate too which degree the complexities in the TOE were applicable to the project and if any complexities were missing in the framework. The complexities in the TOE framework that scored highest on the TOE scoring list are: - Involvement of different technical disciplines - Technical risks - High project schedule drive - Level of competition These high scoring complexities reflect the image that development projects in the semiconductor industry require multidisciplinary teams, that technical risks are often high (since it is not always known whether certain solutions will provide the required functionality), that there is high drive to develop new products quickly and that there is a high level of competition on the market. Next to the complexities that are directly related to the TOE framework, interviewees were also asked to share their views and experiences with the Numetrics system. A number of observations and recommendations with respect to this system are presented in this thesis. Adaptation and application of TOE From the original TOE framework, five elements were considered to be not applicable to the projects by the interviewees. These elements are not present the adapted version of the TOE framework for use at NXP. The interviewees also indicated that a number of complexities were missing or not precisely enough described in the TOE framework. In total 13 elements are added to the existing framework (4 technical, 5 organizational and 4 external elements). These adaptations lead to a new version of the TOE framework, that is modified to meet the situation at NXP. A preliminary version of a score chart is made, on which a project manager can indicate which complexities could be present in a project that is under planning. However, further research would be needed to successfully implement the application of TOE in practice. A possible way of applying TOE would be to use a similar approach that is taken by Numetrics – a tool that is currently being used at NXP to assess the design complexity of product developments. Since the relevance of Numetrics is limited to product development projects, the TOE approach would have an added value by also addressing other types of projects, such as process developments. Next to the version of TOE that is adapted to meet the needs of NXP, a suggestion is made for the inclusion of four new elements, which were the result of the case studies that were performed in this research project. Conclusions The research project shows that the possible application of the TOE framework could have benefits for NXP. As the case studies show, complexities can have a large influence on the project’s execution and success. Therefore, a tool that can assess the complexity and sources of complexity of multiple types of (development) projects would be of value to the company. Recommendations Towards the company, a number of recommendations are given. Firstly, although the BCaM framework is of much value to the company, one of the outcomes of the interviews was that the time between gates can be quite long. This can have a negative effect on the focus in the project team and including more steps into the system would increase the focus in the team. Secondly, we believe that the implementation of TOE in the planning phase of projects can add value by giving the project manager insight into the types of complexities that are expected to be encountered in the project under planning.
