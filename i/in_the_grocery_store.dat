5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area, {{taking a}} {{vacation}} in Maine. After stumbling upon the carnage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store,</b> Scully telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and describes the bizarre situation. Mulder tells Scully that the incident might {{be the result of}} witchcraft or sorcery. Scully, however, can find no physical evidence that might support his theory. Assisted by the local police, Scully reviews the store's surveillance footage and notices Melissa Turner leaving the scene, the only customer unaffected. Jack Bonsaint, the police chief, tells Scully that some townspeople believe Melissa to be a witch. Deputy Buddy Riggs informs Melissa that Bonsaint will be questioning her. Riggs promises to help Melissa, but she warns him to stay away.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{within the field}} of {{agriculture}} that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals. Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels {{from the beginning of the}} process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors. The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store.</b> These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

2500|$|Elderspeak is also {{commonly}} used in the general community, {{not only in the}} context of health care. In the workplace elderspeak is quite prevalent. Elderly persons usually receive mistreatment from those that they trust or depend on, or who depend on them. In the workplace these people could be managerial, supervisory, and peer staff. Severe forms of elderspeak contribute to discrimination in the workplace, potentially infringing on the basic human right of that individual to a safe work environment. Elderspeak is affected by context. Community or institute, meaning that people use elderspeak towards elderly people in the community, such as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> or the coffee shop, or in an institute such as a nursing home. An element of context is the relationship between the speaker and the elderly person. [...] People in closer relationships {{will be more likely to}} know the cognitive function of the individual, acquaintances or strangers would be less likely to make accurate judgements of this.|$|E

40|$|It {{has become}} easier for {{companies}} to operate across <b>the</b> borders <b>in</b> Europe. From being a domestic market, <b>the</b> Swedish <b>grocery</b> market is now going through an internationalisation process. A trend today is that many retailers produce their own private label. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine positioning strategies on <b>the</b> Swedish <b>grocery</b> market with focus on private label products and product range. We will compare Swedish grocery retailers with Lidl, a German <b>grocery</b> retailer on <b>the</b> Swedish market, to show <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> their positioning strategies. The purpose is further to examine if the customers’ apprehension of the stores agrees with the observed positioning strategies. No research of <b>the</b> Swedish <b>grocery</b> market regarding positioning strategies has included Lidl before. Primary data was collected through observations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> and also through questionnaires that were handed out to <b>the</b> customers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stores. The analysis, about the stores’ positioning strategies, shows that the largest difference is between the two Swedish stores and Lidl. The Swedish stores offer large ranges with a small share of private label products, while Lidl offers small ranges with a very large share of private label products. The largest differences are Lidl’s customers’ apprehension of the stores’ share of private label products The position is supposed to reflect benefits and advantages to the consumers.

40|$|Background: Recently, the Swedish food {{culture has}} {{expanded}} {{by leaps and}} bounds. Interest in food and cooking has taken more space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish welfare state. Products and icons, such as organic free range chicken or Per Moberg have had greater impact on the way we consume food.

With an increased interest in food, supply and distribution channels have become increasingly important for <b>the</b> major <b>grocery</b> retailers (Board of Agriculture 2011). A new way to buy food has taken shape over the net. Several companies launch various food concepts, and shopping over the Internet has become a popular way to buy food. (www. hui. se/arets-julklapp).

Purpose: To find out how loyal consumers are towards COOP Konsums webbservices. Method: By finding out where the consumer would consider shopping over the web, will prove how loyal they are towards the physical store. The essay is based on quantitative data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of surveys of customers at the COOP Konsum Bondegatan. Theory: The essay will rely on theories about loyalty, e-loyalty and purchasing decision process...|$|R
