40|$|Senate Hearings on the GAO {{report on}} the nuclear triad and on the START treaty showed that {{vulnerabilities}} of the U. S. triad were vastly over‐stated, that the performance of new projected strategic systems was over‐estimated, and that the performance of existing U. S. strategic systems was under‐estimated. These exaggerations enhanced the psychological (Freud) aspects of the Cold War and compromised logic (Newton). With {{the end of the}} Cold War it is imperative that we re‐examine the basic premises that guided the choices of the strategic nuclear systems. The initial bottom line is that these systems were successful in that they did deter nuclear war without destroying either or both superpowers. However, now that the emotion of the conflict has passed, the effectiveness of the nuclear triad should be examined to determine <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> and which technical conventional wisdoms were incorrect. As this paper documents, incorrect technical estimates took place. These errors (and/or exaggerations) caused the U. S. to greatly increase the capabilities of its nuclear triad. At a minimum, these errors were fiscally wasteful, and at a maximum they could have endangered the stability between the countries. This paper examines technical aspects of the robustness of the triad, rather than the psychological causes and consequences of worst‐case analysis.
