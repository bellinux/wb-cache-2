25|$|If {{the person}} has kidney failure or {{cutaneous}} vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. On rare occasions, thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On <b>histopathological</b> <b>examination,</b> a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are {{the main reason for}} the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. However, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.|$|E

2500|$|... {{is where}} the hCG level does not spontaneously decline and no intrauterine or ectopic {{pregnancy}} is identified on follow-up transvaginal ultrasonography. A persisting PUL is likely either a small ectopic pregnancy {{that has not been}} visualized, or a retained trophoblast in the endometrial cavity. Treatment should only be considered when a potentially viable intrauterine pregnancy has been definitively excluded. A treated persistent PUL is defined as one managed medically (generally with methotrexate) without confirmation of the location of the pregnancy such as by ultrasound, laparoscopy or uterine evacuation. A resolved persistent PUL is defined as serum hCG reaching a non-pregnant value (generally less than 5 IU/l) after expectant management, or after uterine evacuation without evidence of chorionic villi on <b>histopathological</b> <b>examination.</b> In contrast, a relatively low and unresolving level of serum hCG indicates the possibility of an hCG-secreting tumour.|$|E
2500|$|Histopathology {{refers to}} the {{microscopic}} examination of various forms of human tissue. [...] Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology {{refers to the}} examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides. [...] This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments. [...] <b>Histopathological</b> <b>examination</b> of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. [...] The tissue {{is removed from the}} body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is formalin, although frozen section fixing is also common. [...] To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast. [...] Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue. [...] The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist. [...] In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: We analyze our {{experience}} on BPH through 20 years of <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> {{performed by the}} same pathologist. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> performed from January 1979 to December 1998 in patients undergoing surgery in our urological clinic who were diagnosed with BPH.

These histological variables were analyzed according to some clinical parameters such as age, prostate volume and serum PSA.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to use TaqMan {{real-time}} PCR technique to investigate Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) proviral DNA in whole blood samples of sheep, and compare the results to those of <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations.</b> Material and Methods: Eighty blood samples from clinically healthy sheep were randomly collected before the animals were slaughtered. Ten tissue samples from each lung and associated caudal mediastinal lymph node were taken. Results: Fifteen (18. 75 %) blood samples were found to contain proviral DNA, and 11 (13. 75 %) corresponding lung samples showed microscopic changes consistent with ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma. None of the samples displayed metastases to the caudal mediastinal lymph nodes. The prominent pattern of neoplastic nodules consisted of acinar (alveolar) form. Conclusion: The results indicated the higher sensitivity of real-time PCR compared to <b>histopathological</b> <b>examinations</b> in detection of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma...|$|R
