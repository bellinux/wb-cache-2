40|$|An {{investigation}} of nominal loss in 3 %SiFe and amorphous of the transformer core materials will evaluate in this paper. The investigation involves the variation of power loss, flux leakage, and total harmonic distortion. The nominal loss has been measured using <b>Epstein</b> <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> {{with three layers}} of lamination. The loss in the amorphous transformer core material is 57. 46 % better than the transformer core with 3 % SiFe material at flux density of 1. 2 T, 50 Hz. The flux leakage at corner in the 3 % SiFe transformer core material is the lowest than the two of transformer core material, over the whole flux density range. Total harmonic distortion flux is {{the largest in the}} amorphous of transformer core materials and the smallest in the 3 % SiFe of transformer core material. Using the amorphous material in transformer core is more efficient than the two of transformer core materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{power loss}} in {{laminated}} transformer cores is always {{greater than the}} nominal loss of the electrical steel laminations, by a factor known as the building factor. This paper discussed result of an investigation towards the effect of using two different Grain-Oriented Silicon Iron (3 %SiFe) materials to the 100 kVA three phase distribution transformer. The thicknesses of the material {{that have been used}} in this research are 0. 23 mm and 0. 27 mm. The transformer core will be assembled with 60 o T-joint with 5 mm mitred corner overlap length. Power loss has been measured using no-load test with 29 layer of lamination while nominal loss measured using <b>Epstein</b> <b>test</b> <b>frame.</b> At the operation mode flux density, 1. 5 T, the building factor of the transformer model core material with 0. 23 mm thickness is 1. 219 while with the building factor for 0. 27 mm thickness is 1. 250. This shows that thinner transformer core lamination is better than the other one by 2. 5 % during operation mode...|$|E

We capture the constraints among various values (or ranges of values) of the parameters and environment conditions identified from the specification, known formally as choices.

Based on the theory, algorithms {{have been developed for}} generating <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> from the relations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for automatically generating logical schemata that specify groups of black-box test cases from formal specifications containing universal and existential quantification. These schemata are called <b>test</b> <b>frames.</b> Previous automated techniques {{have dealt with}} languages based on propositional logic. Since this new technique deals with quantification it {{can be applied to}} more expressive specifications. This makes the technique applicable to specifications written at the system requirements level. The limitations imposed by quanti cation are discussed. Industrial needs are addressed by the capabilities of recognizing and augmenting existing <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> and by accommodating a range of specification-coverage schemes. The coverage scheme taxonomy introduced in this paper provides a standard for controlling the number of <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced. This technique is intended to automate portions of what is done manually by practitioners. Basing this technique on formal rules of logical derivation ensures that the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> produced are logical consequences of the specification. It is expected that deriving <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> automatically will offset the cost of developing a formal specification. This tangible product makes formal specification more economically feasible for industry...|$|R
40|$|This study {{contains}} {{the identification of}} modal dynamic properties of a 3 -story large-scale steel <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> structure through shaking table measurements. Shaking table test is carried out to estimate the modal properties of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> such as natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. Among many different model structures, ARX (Auto Recursive Exogenous) model structure is used for modal identification of the frame structure system. The unknown parameters in the obtained ARX model structure are estimated by Least-Square method by minimizing the AIC criteria {{with the help of}} a program coded in advanced computing software MATLABÂ®. The adopted model structure is then tested out in time domain to verify the validity of the model with the selected model parameters. Then the modal characteristics of <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> and the story stiffness are estimated using the white noise shakings. An attempt is done to determine the change of modal characteristics and the story stiffness of <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> according to the velocity, which the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> structure experienced during the shaking schedule and also during the input shaking of El Centro 1940 NS.

40|$|Advances {{in space}} {{telescope}} and aperture technology {{have created a}} need to launch larger structures into space. Traditional truss structures will be too heavy and bulky to be effectively used {{in the next generation}} of space-based structures. Large deployable structures are a possible solution.

This project outlines the construction of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> that supports a gravity offload system. The <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> is stable enough to hold the gravity offload system and does not interfere with deployment of, or vibrations in, the deployable test boom.

40|$|The {{results of}} shake table tests on three concentrically-braced sub-frames are {{compared}} {{with a series of}} correlative inelastic analyses. Both transient time-history and nonlinear static (pushover) analyses are considered. The lateral resistance of the <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> is provided by a pair of cold-formed tubular steel members. The brace cross-section is varied between tests to investigate the influence of brace slenderness on the stiffness, resistance and ductility displayed by the frame under strong earthquake loading. Response simulations using a two-dimensional analytical model of the <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> are compared with the experimental results. Brace strengths and elastic <b>test</b> <b>frame</b> properties established in complementary static tensile tests and low-level shake table tests, respectively, are used to determine model input data. The transient acceleration and displacement response of the frames calculated in nonlinear time-history analyses are compared with corresponding experimental measurements. The base shear frame drift relationship is calculated using pushover analyses that consider either the resistance of both frame braces or the tension brace alone. These are compared with the experimental hysteretic response of the <b>test</b> <b>frame.</b> On the whole, the analytical results are observed to agree well with the experimental results, especially with respect to brace tension forces and frame base shear.

40|$|An object {{rotating}} {{in depth}} presents a coherent sequence of views but each view is seen only briefly. This scenario raises two questions {{addressed in the}} present study: (1) Do observers encode {{the dynamics of the}} motion sequence or only the discrete views that comprise the sequence? (2) If motion dynamics are encoded, how do they affect recognition? Observers viewed a movie of an object rotating in depth (study) followed by a static frame showing a single view (test) and judged whether study and test showed the same or different objects. We also manipulated the diagnosticity of the shape information present in the stimulus set and where the test view fell along the rotation trajectory implied by the movie (preceding, early, middle, late, following â all equally spaced). We found that: (1) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that followed the trajectory of the motion sequence were better recognized than <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that preceded the motion sequence; (2) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> that were actually seen in the sequence were better recognized than following test frames; (3) <b>test</b> <b>frames</b> {{from the end of the}} sequence were better recognized than frames from the middle or early part of the sequence. We conclude that observers are biased to encode or remember views that occur near the end of an implied motion trajectory. Moreover, observers use dynamic information to predict unseen views of an object that are consistent with the implied direction of motion. Interestingly, a similar pattern across test conditions was observed for both same and different object trials, suggesting that information encoded about object dynamics is not limited to the particular object being viewed, but instead generalizes to visually-similar objects...|$|R
