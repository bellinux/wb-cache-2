2500|$|Miers {{met with}} the Senate Judiciary Committee after her {{nomination}} and in those meetings she was ill-prepared and uninformed on the law. Senator Tom Coburn told her privately that she [...] "flunked" [...] and [...] " [...] going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> next time." [...] Miers had difficulty expressing her views and explaining basic constitutional law concepts. Miers had no experience in constitutional law {{and did not have}} extensive litigation experience; at her Texas law firm, she had been more of a manager. In addition, Miers had rarely handled appeals and did not understand the complicated constitutional questions senators asked of her. To White House lawyers, Miers was [...] "less an attorney than a law firm manager and bar association president." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> I need to say what I want to say, and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
60|$|Shelton {{welcomed the}} shower; it {{appeared}} to him an intervention {{on the part of}} Providence. He would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but not now, later.|$|E
60|$|JILL. (Disconsolately) I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> I'm glad I went, anyway. I {{feel more}} human.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. [Gravely.] I should <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{very like}} it, Harry. But I shouldn't {{have put it}} so bluntly.|$|R
60|$|Said he {{was going}} to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> wouldn't you? You wouldn't {{chat about}} the weather, would you? You wouldn't discuss the latest play? You {{would have to}} think up some mighty good reason for being out of bed at that time, wouldn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{see that}} you and I can do anything," [...] said Mr. Gresham. [...] "I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in the House as to the poor fellow's death, but I {{certainly}} shall not express a suspicion. Why should I?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Oh, dont scold the child: he'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{like that}} if it was to be his last word on earth. Besides, hes quite right: my poor father had asked for his usual five pounds; and John gave him a hundred in his big way. Just like a king.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn't help it," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> or--or bust! Perhaps {{this will}} suit you better," [...] and he continued: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I did {{not know}} what <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}},</b> and, moreover, that something must not be wholly inconsistent with my explanation to Mary.|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> patriotic, or he'd {{have been}} mobbed," [...] was Lucile's serious comment. [...] "I hadn't thought of Jake Kasker, before, {{but he may}} be the culprit." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{hard work}} to make a speech when you have listened to {{compliments}} from the powers in authority. A compliment is a hard text to preach to. When the chairman introduces me as a person of merit, and when he says pleasant things about me, I always feel like answering simply that {{what he says is}} true; that it is all right; that, as far as I am concerned, the things he said can stand as they are. But you always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> and that is what frightens me.|$|E
60|$|A {{method of}} proof which, when used as directed, gives {{sometimes}} truth and sometimes falsehood--as the method of simple enumeration does--is obviously not a valid method, for validity demands invariable truth. Thus, if simple enumeration is to be rendered valid, it must not be stated as Mill states it. We shall have to say, at most, that the data render the result probable. Causation holds, we shall say, in every instance {{we have been able}} to test; therefore it probably holds in untested instances. There are terrible difficulties in the notion of probability, but we may ignore them at present. We thus have what at least may be a logical principle, since it is without exception. If a proposition is true in every instance that we happen to know of, and if the instances are very numerous, then, we shall say, it becomes very probable, on the data, that it will be true in any further instance. This is not refuted by the fact that what we declare to be probable does not always happen, for an event may be probable on the data and yet not occur. It is, however, obviously capable of further analysis, and of more exact statement. We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> like this: that every instance of a proposition[10] being true increases the probability of its being true in a fresh instance, and that a sufficient number of favourable instances will, in the absence of instances to the contrary, make the probability of the truth of a fresh instance approach indefinitely near to certainty. Some such principle as this is required if the method of simple enumeration is to be valid.|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Warrington," [...] Rachel replied rashly, {{because she}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> She did indeed see Susan murmuring to Mrs. Elliot, while Arthur {{stared at her}} with {{complete}} confidence in his own love. Both Rachel and Evelyn then began {{to listen to what}} Susan was saying.|$|R
6000|$|There were in Powell's head {{no special}} words {{to fit the}} horror of his feelings. So he said--he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> [...] "Good God! What were you {{thinking}} of, Mr Smith, to try to..." [...] And then he left off. He dared not utter the awful word poison. Mr Smith stopped his prowl.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must be tired," [...] I said. One <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> if only <b>to</b> assert oneself {{against that}} wearisome, passionless and {{crushing}} uproar. She raised {{her eyes for}} a moment. No, she was not. Not very. She had not walked all the way. She came by train as far as Whitechapel Station and had only walked from there.|$|R
5000|$|One {{wins the}} game by getting rid of all of their cards. Most of the time, the winner will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> (Usually [...] "Mau") at this point, or {{they will be given}} penalty cards, and will {{have to get rid of}} those before winning. If their last card is a Jack, they must reply {{differently}} (Usually [...] "Mau Mau").|$|E
5000|$|Lydia Shire (born 1948) is a Boston-based {{chef and}} restaurateur. She said of herself [...] "If I weren’t a chef, well, I feel I’m the best butcher I’ve ever seen. …The {{hardest part of}} my job is {{managing}} people, and there are times when you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to somebody that you really don’t want to. …That’s what I love about being a butcher: I’m just there with my big old dead animal on the board." ...|$|E
5000|$|Their {{music has}} changed {{throughout}} each release. For their first album, Light From Above, critics described is as heavy metal and speed metal. For their second release, Post Mortem, {{they changed their}} sound to Metalcore. On their latest release, Just Another Drug EP, they have a more Hard Rock sound {{with a mix of}} some metalcore. In an interview, Gabriel has stated [...] "We don’t like to limit ourselves; If I did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> I’d just say we’re a rock band.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't mean it that way," [...] {{said the}} other, with some confusion. [...] "I felt I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> cheerful <b>to</b> rouse you up, {{and that was}} the best I could make of it. Anyway, we'll both feel better after supper, and I'm hoping we'll yet see the man who turned you out in a tight place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may as well}} {{mention it}} at last," [...] Nick went on. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him in the lobby there when we met--something I was pretty sure he couldn't like. I let him have it full in the face--it seemed to me better and wiser. I {{let him know that}} Juliet's married." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{his wife}} left the room, however, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> so {{they spoke of}} shooting. The Saint had a redeeming feature--he was {{somewhat}} of a sportsman, though a poor one, and he described to Geoffrey {{a new pair of}} hammerless guns, which he had bought for a trifling sum of a hundred and forty guineas, recommending the pattern to his notice.|$|R
5000|$|Anita Gates of the New York Times {{said the}} series [...] "has an {{appealing}} cast and doesn't insult viewers' intelligence {{most of the}} time. But the main characters - who are 100 percent good and face off against people who are 100 percent bad - {{always seem to be}} making self-righteous speeches [...] [...] [...] There's nothing wrong with inspiring little speeches that make audiences cheer. It was always a pleasure to see Dixie Carter get carried away with one of hers on Designing Women. But the speeches <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in a fresh way, and even Ms. Carter's orations got old once the show's writers became so self-conscious about them.|$|E

5000|$|In a news interview, Murray says he {{went before}} a parole board four times, {{maintaining}} his innocence until the fifth: [...] "I said what the hell, {{let me tell}} these people {{what they want to}} hear." [...] He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. [...] "I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. ... I became so desperate to get out, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> because what I said before didn't work." [...] His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, Medwed's Second Look clinic, a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about everybody," [...] Miss Allan added. [...] "That is what I find so difficult, <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> {{different}} about everybody."

[...] "The young people are very keen about it. It begins again in half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|Banker made no answer, {{but still}} {{kept his eyes}} fixed upon the professor.

[...] "I think the matter may now be {{considered}} settled. Will you suggest as much to the magistrate? Truly, I have not a moment to spare." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} concepts in the study of body language is that of non-verbal leakage. This occurs when we say one thing but our body language gestures give a different impression.The most obvious of these are hand-to-face gestures. The best way to understand these is to think how you behaved when you were a small child. What did you do then if you saw something frightening? You put your hands over your eyes, because in a toddler’s mind, if you can’t see it, it’s not there. [...] If you aren’t aware of non-verbal leakage, your body language will scream out to your audience that something is wrong. They won’t necessarily know exactly what that is, but they will subconsciously pick up the incongruity between your verbal and non-verbal messages, and that you are uncomfortable in some way about what you are saying. Therefore you need to know the telltale signs of leakage so you can avoid making them and rehearse your delivery showing open, confident body language instead.So, what do people do when they see, hear or <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> they are uncomfortable with? ...|$|E

30|$|I {{need to be}} coarse when I {{talk with}} them … I feel that I lose my quality (suzhi) when I criticize them… Sometimes, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> like, ‘what {{the hell are you}} doing, you stupid old bitch?’ Or like ‘If {{you do not want to}} work here then get the hell out of my kitchen.’ They felt pretty {{comfortable}} when I use coarse words and even understand my orders better.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it is not!" [...] cried Meg in {{a sudden}} passion: [...] "Is it now, Emily?

6000|$|The {{children}} both {{began to}} shake the papa, and he was glad enough to go on sensibly. [...] "Well, anyway, the mother locomotive certainly oughtn't <b>to</b> <b>have</b> deceived it. Still she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> and perhaps the little Pony Engine was better employed watching its buffers with its head-light, to see whether its cow-catcher <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> grow, {{than it would have}} been in listening to the stories of the old locomotives, and sometimes their swearing." ...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to hermeneutic interpretation or social-scientific reconstruction, phenomenological description aims at keeping different epistemological levels apart; the visible and the utterable, the implicit and the explicit. With regards to research practice, {{the difference of}} <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> which cannot be said, but which shows itself and in showing shows itself as something, becomes thematic. At this point, the respect for the matter in question and for the different perspectives on the matter becomes manifest (Brinkmann 2016 a, b).|$|R
