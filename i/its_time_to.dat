Greed {{was one of the few}} films of <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be shot entirely on location. Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as deep-focus cinematography and montage editing. He considered Greed to be a Greek tragedy, in which environment and heredity controlled the characters' fates and reduced them to primitive bête humaines (human beasts).|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E

25|$|The MSX3 was {{scheduled}} for market in 1990. Delays {{in the development of}} its VDP—then named V9978 on the pre-release spec sheets—caused Yamaha to miss <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> market deadline. In its place, an improved MSX2+ was released as the MSX TurboR; features of the new R800 processor such as DMA and 24-bit addressing were disabled. The VDP was eventually delivered two years after its planned deadline, by which time the market had moved on. In an attempt to reduce its financial loss, Yamaha stripped nearly all V9958 compatibility and marketed the resulting V9990 E-VDP III as a video-chipset for PC VGA graphic cards, with moderate success. Sony also employed the V7040 RGB encoder chip on many other products. MSX-FAN Magazine also mentions the then-impressive power of the V9990, being able to compete with much more expensive hardware such as the Sharp X68000.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens {{to take them out}} but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should have faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E

[...] Ultimately, the Byrds' experimentation with the country genre on Sweetheart of the Rodeo was slightly ahead of <b>its</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> the detriment of the band's commercial fortunes, as the international success of country rock-flavored bands like The Eagles, America and Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show during the 1970s demonstrated.|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the manufacturer's trials in April 1947, one aircraft was returned to the factory for extensive modifications as the 150M. The wing tips were angled downward 35° to reduce the lateral stability, the wing was redesigned to detach from the fuselage, and the aerodynamic balancing of the elevators was reduced from 24% to 20%. The fuel capacity was increased to , the cockpit was widened by [...] and fitted with an ejection seat. Fore and aft armor plates were fitted to protect the pilot and a new radio aerial mast was installed. All these changes added [...] of weight and increased drag which reduced the aircraft's top speed by , and slowed <b>its</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> [...] from 4.8 to 7.2 minutes in comparison to the unmodified aircraft. Given that a higher-performance design, the Aircraft 156, had already been submitted for state acceptance trials, Semyon Lavochkin decided not to continue the development of the 150M.|$|E

The three-bladed [...] AV-5L-114 propellers were exchanged for four-bladed [...] AV-9B-L-149 propellers and the engine installation was redesigned, after wind tunnel tests by TsAGI (Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute), which revealed that the poorly designed engine accessories were the major cause of the excess drag.

The German advance on Moscow in October 1941 forced the Institute and the DIS to evacuate to Kazan while the OKO and its factory went to Kuibyshev. The failure of the AM-37 to enter production doomed the project, albeit temporarily.|$|E

[...] Ella Taylor argued in favor of Flame & Citron, saying it [...] "is the film that the horribly overrated Black Book could have been, had Paul Verhoeven not indulged in the puerile reversals of sensitive Nazis and treacherous partisans." [...] Fuchs also compared the moral dilemmas the characters have to deal with to Black Book and Steven Spielberg's Munich but said Flame & Citron does not have [...] "the splendid surrealish excess" [...] and [...] "the weird conflation of maternal bodies and motherlands" [...] of the two films, respectively. Gleiberman could [...] "feel the shadow of Steven Spielberg's Munich hovering over Flame & Citron".|$|E
