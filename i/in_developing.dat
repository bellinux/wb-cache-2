5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the strengths and weaknesses of innovation programs <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries. We used a mixed-methods approach, quantitative as survey and qualitative as a multi-case study to examine innovation best practices <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> and <b>developing</b> countries. <b>In</b> addition, four case studies of innovation organisations based on the best practices and successful implementation <b>in</b> the <b>developed</b> and developing countries are selected for examination. The research findings provide guidance, suggestions, and recommendations for future implementation <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries for practitioners such as policy makers, governments, funded organizations, and strategic institutions. In conclusion, innovation programs are vital tools for economic growth, knowledge, and technology transfer based on the several indicators such as creativity, entrepreneurship, role of government, role of university, strategic focus, new products, survival rate, job creation, start-up companies, and number of patents. The authors aim to conduct future research which will include a comparative study of innovation case studies between developed and developing countries for policy implications worldwide.

This is used to examine how production shifts through imitation by developing countries affect the domestic wage differential and supply of skilled labour <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> countries. <b>In</b> the model, production shifts increase the demand for researchers <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> countries and cause higher relative wages for skilled labour: this leads to more individuals acquiring the skills. As a consequence, the model helps to explain the simultaneous increase in the domestic wage gap and in the supply of skilled labour observed <b>in</b> <b>developed</b> countries. ...|$|R
