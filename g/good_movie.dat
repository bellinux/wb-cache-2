The story treatment was written by James Cameron himself, serving as the outline for the writer's room. Cameron and Miller meet in-person once a week to discuss the film in detail and talk via phone daily to discuss the writing process. Miller stated that the tone will be the same as the first two films. Cameron and Miller jointly acknowledged that the focus of the film is not to create more sequels or generate revenue, but to instead create the proper sequel, with the goal being to just make a <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> However, there is a plan for a trilogy that would conclude the story should this first film prove successful.|$|E

500|$|Although Coppola {{enjoyed his}} working {{relationship}} with Lucas, he commented in a July 1988 The New York Times interview with Robert Lindsey that [...] "I think it's a <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> - it's eccentric, a little wacky, like the Tucker car - but it's not the movie I would have made {{at the height of}} my power." [...] Coppola was able to stoically accept the critical and commercial reaction to Tucker: The Man and His Dream. [...] "Every time in my career I tried to make, dare I say it, an art film, it never did well." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Push the Button" [...] was conceptualised after {{group member}} Keisha Buchanan {{developed}} an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian {{that she made}} advances towards the man, but {{he was unaware of}} her intentions: [...] "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say."

500|$|Although {{many critics}} {{identify}} some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, {{they say that}} [...] "this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it a <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> in its own right". Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled [...] "largely annoying 'Afterschool Special' archetypes" [...] who are [...] "irritating and incessantly screaming" [...] and [...] "don't make for very sympathetic victims". Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast, some critics have compared the film to the popular slasher films that would soon follow. Also comparing the film's [...] "interchangeable teens to slasher films, particularly the Friday the 13th franchise, Muir says that [...] "it feels wrong for a Jaws film to dwell in that shallow domain." [...] However, the critic also commends the teen characters' comradeship and heroism, citing the girl killed when saving Sean from the shark.|$|E

500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "there {{may be more}} {{entertaining}} and less problematic movies, but Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has something about it that hangs in there, working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} a <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> It is one of those movies that brush away our cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Warner Bros. planned {{to produce a}} feature biographical film about actor James Dean, and the studio hired Israel Horovitz to write the script. One of the working titles was James Dean: An Invented Life before it was {{finalized}} as James Dean. When Horovitz wrote the script, he explored the [...] "psychological insight" [...] of Dean by showcasing the abandonment of his father, which became the fulcrum of the storyline. Horovitz recalled, [...] "Why would a father ship his wife's body back on a train with an 8-year-old son, never go to the funeral and never pick the son up again, never bring the son back out to him?" [...] The screenwriter felt {{it was best to}} portray Dean's purported homosexuality by innuendo rather than explicitly. He wanted to focus on the romance between Dean and Pier Angeli and Dean's growth as an actor, and believed that a homosexuality subplot would distract from the storyline. Producer Marvin Worth explained in July 1995, [...] "We'll try to make a <b>good</b> <b>movie...</b> not one of rumor and innuendo." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{originally}} {{had a different}} ending to the one later released in America under the title Shades of Fear. Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein requested that the ending be reworked prior to distribution, and Winterson was highly unhappy at being asked to write an additional conclusionary scene. Winterson's preferred ending sees Rex Goodyear burn the painting he believes to be fraudulent, only to discover he actually had the genuine item in his possession all along, and has now destroyed it. This ties in with the major theme of the film in Winterson's eyes, whereby [...] "Duncan, Gabriel, Miss Bead and Miss Quim all find something valuable where they least expected it, Rex Goodyear finds that the things we value are very often worthless." [...] Winterson has called Weinstein [...] "a bully who knows the gentle touch", referring to the new ending as [...] "the most expensive words I will ever write". While she believes that the new ending is satisfying, she feels the film has lost some dimensions which were important to her and concludes: [...] "It is a <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> {{but it is not}} the movie I thought we could make. [...] I do like Great Moments but there is another film in there somewhere that has got lost." ...|$|E
500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following this {{he took a}} {{break from}} filmmaking, stating that, [...] "My {{industrial}} life was kind of hectic, but I was never detached from movies. There was always this gnawing feeling inside of me." [...] "After seeing movies with audiences of 3 to 4 million in recent years, I started getting upset with myself, wondering why conservative people can’t make <b>good</b> <b>movies.</b> So, I liquidated my business and spent time making movies." [...] He returned to the screens as co-writer, producer and director of Free Man (2011).|$|R
5000|$|In his {{biography}} of Oswald, Kay Weniger recalled Oswald's problems with shooting <b>good</b> <b>movies</b> in Hollywood: [...] "Of all his films, only his barely screened I Was a Criminal (the U.S. {{version of his}} The Captain from Köpenick), with an excellent performance by Albert Bassermann in the leading role, is of any relevance. As U.S. audiences {{had a hard time}} relating to themes of Prussian militarism, subservience and lack of democracy, the film went without a distributior for many years and only premiered at the beginning of 1945".|$|R

500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told a fellow who was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly <b>good</b> <b>movie,</b> {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational". Writing for Film Journal International, Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how [...] "Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys {{the excitement of}} the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [...] the crushing blow of the loss." [...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and feeling a little sheepish." [...] Dana Stevens, writing for The New York Times, asserted, [...] "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee," [...] and [...] "a trio of crack performances" [...] can turn [...] "a formulaic sports picture" [...] into a [...] "tale that manages to inspire without being sappy." [...] Shantayaé Grant of The Jamaica Observer wrote that [...] "acting is spectacular, the emotions are real and this story of black triumph is simply phenomenal." [...] New York Press critic affirmed that Akeelah and the Bee [...] "resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is" [...] because it has [...] "dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a <b>good</b> <b>movie?</b> Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E

500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin {{awarded the}} film five stars out of five, likening the {{experience}} of watching it to rediscovering a favorite childhood cartoon. He praised del Toro for investing his own affection for the genre and sense of artistry into the project {{in such a way}} that the viewer found themselves immersed in the film rather than watching from afar, noting the director had catered to younger and older audiences alike and expressed surprise that the film could rise above the sum of its parts. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a positive review, describing the film as the sum of the potential every monster film had ever tried to fulfill. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post gave the film four stars out of four, and said it had [...] "no shortage of brains, brawn, eye candy, wit and even some poetry", praising the [...] "clean and coherent" [...] action sequences and the [...] "terrific chemistry" [...] between Hunnam and Kikuchi. Drew McWeeny of HitFix highlighted other aspects of the film, paying particular attention to the production and art design. He also praised the cinematography for [...] "perfectly capturing" [...] the film, and described the score as [...] "ridiculously cool". Rolling Stones Peter Travers called the film [...] "the work of a humanist ready to banish cynicism for compassion", saying that del Toro [...] "drives the action with a heartbeat". Keith Uhlich of Time Out called the film [...] "pure, pleasurable comic-book absurdity", and noted that del Toro had lent the proceedings a [...] "plausible humanity" [...] lacking in most of summer 2013's destruction-heavy blockbusters. He said the Kaijus' civilian victims make a [...] "palpably personal impression", deeming one scene with Mako Mori [...] "as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime, like Neon Genesis Evangelion, that the director emulates with expert aplomb." [...] The Village Voices Stephanie Zacharek called it [...] "summer entertainment with a pulse", praising its [...] "dumbly brilliant" [...] action and freedom from elitism, but noted the story is predictable and suggested del Toro's time would be better spent on more visionary films. Angela Watercutter of Wired called it the [...] "most awesome movie of the summer", a [...] "fist-pumping, awe-inspiring ride", and opined that its focus on spectacle rather than characterization [...] "simply does not matter" [...] in the summer blockbuster context. Richard Roeper gave the film a B, commenting that either the Jaegers or Kaiju [...] "can take down any of the Transformers." [...] Leonard Maltin gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling it [...] "three-quarters of a really <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> that doesn't know when to quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, stating {{that it is}} [...] "neither a <b>good</b> <b>movie</b> nor a bad one. It {{features}} actors that we like doing things we wish were more interesting." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "It is {{possible to have a}} good time at RED, but it is not a very <b>good</b> <b>movie.</b> It doesn't really try to be, and given the present state of the Hollywood economy, this may be a wise choice". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "It's not that it doesn't have effective moments, it's that it doesn't have as many as it thinks it does. The film's inescapable air of glib self-satisfaction is not only largely unearned, it's downright irritating".|$|E
