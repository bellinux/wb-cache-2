40|$|This {{experiment}} {{tested to}} what extent identification with a new merger group {{is determined by the}} status of that merger group and by the relative representation of the pre-merger ingroup. One hundred university students were assigned to a team of `inductive' thinkers, and were later merged with a team of 'deductive' thinkers to form a team of 'analyst' thinkers. The status of the merger group (low, high) and the relative representation of the ingroup into the novel merger group (low, high) were manipulated. Participants identified more with <b>the</b> merger group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low status condition, and they identified more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low representation condition.

This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use.

Significantly, President Tarja Halonen voted during advance voting. However, there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April.

5|$|If the {{proportion}} of barbarians was {{in the region of}} 25%, then it is probably much <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd-century regular army. If the same proportion had been recruited into the auxilia of the 2nd-century army, then in excess of 40% of recruits would have been barbarian-born, since the auxilia constituted 60% of the regular land army. There is no evidence that recruitment of barbarians was on such a large scale in the 2nd century. An analysis of named soldiers of non-Roman origin shows that 75% were Germanic: Franks, Alamanni, Saxons, Goths, and Vandals are attested in the Notitia unit names. Other significant sources of recruits were the Sarmatians from the Danubian lands; and Armenians and Iberians from the Caucasus region.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere. The ratio is about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6. According to some measurements, in the upper atmosphere of Venus D/H ratio is 1.5 <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bulk atmosphere.|$|E

Real wages in 1980 amounted to 232.7 rubles, compared to 166.3 rubles before the 1965 Soviet economic reform and the Eight-Five Year Plan. The first period, 1960–1964, was characterised by low growth, while the second period, 1965–1981, had a stronger growth rate. The second period vividly demonstrated {{the success of the}} Kosygin reform, with the average annual growth in retail turnover being 11.2 billion rubles, 1.8 times <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first period and 1.2 times higher than the third period (1981–1985). Consumption of goods and daily demand also increased. The consumption of home appliances greatly increased. Refrigerators increased from a low of 109,000 in 1964 to 440,000 units by 1973; consumption declined during the reversal of the reform. Car production increased, and would continue to do so until the late 1980s. The Soviet leadership, under pressure, sought to provide more attractive goods for Soviet consumers.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To analyze {{changes of}} serum lipid and hs-CRP levels in {{patients}} with subclinical hypothyroidism in order to explore their correlations with TSH level. Methods: A total of 90 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study and divided into the mild, moderate, and severe groups according to TSH level with 30 cases in each group; meanwhile, 30 healthy individuals were served as the control groups. The changes of the levels of TSH, serum lipid indicators (TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA, ApoB, and Lpa), and hs-CRP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four groups were observed. The correlation of serum lipid and hs-CRP with TSH was analyzed. Results: The levels of TSH, TC, TG, Lpa, and hs-CRP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subclinical hypothyroidism subgroups were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group. The levels of HDL-C, LDL-C, ApoA, and ApoB {{in patients with}} subclinical hypothyroidism were increased {{when compared with the}} control group. The levels of HDL-C, LDL-C, and ApoB <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moderate and severe groups were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group. ApoA level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe group was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group. LDL-C <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moderate group was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mild group, and that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe group was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moderate group. ApoB level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> severe group was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mild group. Spearman correlation analysis showed that TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoB, Lpa, and hs-CRP were positively correlated with TSH level, while HDL-C and ApoA had no correlation with TSH level. Conclusions: The levels of serum lipid and hs- CRP are abnormally elevated in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, and are gradually increased along with the disease progression, which is closely associated with TSH level...|$|R

5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} Northern England regions was 55.9% – <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions {{in the wake of}} the 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
