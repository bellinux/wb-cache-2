40|$|Abstract — The most {{critical}} issue of an H. 264 /AVC decoder {{is the system}} architecture design with balanced pipelining schedules and proper degrees of parallelism. In this paper, a hybrid task pipelining scheme is first presented to greatly reduce the internal memory size and bandwidth. Block-level, macroblocklevel, and macroblock/frame-level pipelining schedules are arranged for CAVLD/IQ/IT/INTRA PRED, INTER PRED, and <b>DEBLOCK,</b> respectively. Appropriate degrees of parallelism for each pipeline task are also proposed. Moreover, efficient modules are contributed. The CAVLD unit smoothly decodes bitstream into symbols without bubble cycles. The INTER PRED unit highly exploits the data reuse between interpolation windows of neighboring blocks to save 60 % of external memory bandwidth. <b>DEBLOCK</b> unit doubles the processing capability of our previous work with only 35. 3 % of logic gate count overhead. The proposed baseline profile decoder architecture can support up to 2048 × 1024 30 fps videos with 217 K logic gates, 10 KB SRAMs, and 528. 9 MB/s bus bandwidth when operating at 120 MHz. I...|$|R
