5|$|The {{inheritance}} of Greater Poland by Przemysł II went peacefully. The union {{proved to be}} durable, and {{with the exception of}} its borders with the Duchy of Wrocław, survived throughout his reign. However, despite the personal unification of the territory, the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> Kalisz and Gniezno persisted almost {{to the end of the}} 18th century. Later, in times of Casimir III the Great, there was also a visible <b>division</b> <b>between</b> the old voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz.|$|E

John Coughlin was appointed head coach of the club in May 2011 as successor to Jim McInally.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{retained}} {{and reinforced}} the manorial system with its <b>division</b> <b>between</b> demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} ontology of {{the world}} is given by its fundamental categories.

5|$|English in England can {{be divided}} into four major dialect regions, Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a <b>division</b> <b>between</b> the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish {{occupation}} during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.|$|E

Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) “rude, overbearing, and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's <b>division</b> <b>between</b> lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.|$|E

The targets of the operation were Base Areas 353, 354, and 707 located north and northeast of Tay Ninh, South Vietnam. Once again, a hunt for COSVN units {{was conducted}}, this time around the Cambodian town of Memot and, once again, the search was futile. During its operations, the 25th Infantry killed 1,017 PAVN and NLF troops while losing 119 of its own men killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the RLF reached {{a level of}} 12 rifle, one {{mechanised}}, and one tank <b>division.</b> <b>Between</b> 1960 and 1964 the rifle and mechanised divisions were converted to motor rifle divisions, and reductions in strength began; force size dropped to six motor rifle and two tank divisions by 1970. From 1970 to 1976, three more motor rifle divisions were formed, but one was deactivated in 1977, and the eight motor rifle and three tank division figure remained that way {{for the rest of}} the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the <b>division</b> <b>between</b> books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) were most likely found in the 2nd book because there does not appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E

He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a <b>division</b> <b>between</b> white magic and black magic, commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist.|$|E

Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.
