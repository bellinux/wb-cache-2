40|$|The {{exploration}} of Mars {{is an important}} part of the space exploration programs of the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, and Japan. Many robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers have been launched toward Mars since the 1960 s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars as well as a preparation for a possible human mission to Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. In this context, taking into consideration other future means of exploration is a must. Since the Mars atmosphere is about 95. 3 % carbon dioxide, 2. 7 % nitrogen and 1. 6 % argon, the CO 2 in the Martian atmosphere may become an oxidizer of unconventional fuelled ramjets such as, in-situ manufactured silanes (Sin H 2 n+ 2) [1, 2]. Compared to a rocket 'hopper', ramjets using the Martian atmosphere may save on-board propellant and thus vehicle mass, a crucial issue, since any such vehicle must either be ferried from Earth, or built in situ. In a previous work [3] by these authors, a preliminary analysis for the feasibility of a hypersonic, CO 2 -breathing ramjet using silanes as fuel was demonstrated: in fact, assuming a total structural weight index of 21. 0 kgf/m 2 (weight index 7. 93 kgf/m 2 on Mars) and a cruise range of 5, 000 km yielded realistic solutions for current industrial materials and fabricating capabilities. In particular, for a 1 -metric ton payload, a take-off <b>gross</b> <b>weigh</b> (TOGW) of order 3. 2 ton, including the propellants needed to achieve ramjet operation turned out. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the engine flow path and of the cruise CL best conditions has been done. In fact, in order to define the optimal engine cycle (i. e., TBCC, RBCC) and combustor flow speed a Builder [4] analysis is performed. The critical flight speed above which the flow must become supersonic within the combustor is found to be 1600 m/s. The most favourable speed for cruise CL is found to be in the Mach range 6 - 7. This speed put this vehicle in the class of hypersonic vehicles with supersonic flow through the combustor...|$|E
5000|$|When arrested, <b>Gross</b> <b>weighed</b> 254 lb. Since {{the start}} of his incarceration, he lost {{considerable}} body weight. Gross refused medical and dental care.According to his wife and attorney, Gross's health had deteriorated during his incarceration and this was a reason to release him immediately. They also claimed he had degenerative arthritis and had difficulty walking. In May 2012, a mass developed on his right shoulder, which was diagnosed by Cuban doctors as a hematoma (collection of blood). Gross's family hired a U.S. radiologist who claimed that the mass was improperly diagnosed, and that Gross could be suffering from cancer so Gross should be released on that basis. Gross's former lawyer, Jared Genser, issued a press release saying he had filed a petition with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. At the same time, [...] "extremely concerned about Alan Gross's health," [...] the U.S. State Department called for Gross's immediate release.|$|R
50|$|Its nose {{stood over}} 6 m high, and {{was made up}} of two {{clamshell}} doors. The doors could only be opened from the inside, when ramps would be used to allow vehicles to drive in or out. Compared to the Ju 52, the Me 321 offered a load area six times larger, at around 100 m2, and could accommodate a <b>gross</b> cargo <b>weighing</b> up to 23 MT. The cargo space had been designed to replicate the load space of a standard German railway flatcar, allowing any cargo that could travel by rail to fit into an Me 321. Alternatively, if used as a passenger transport, 120-130 fully equipped troops could be accommodated.|$|R
5000|$|In literature, {{there are}} two nuggets that claim their status as the biggest gold nuggets in the world: the Welcome Stranger with the Canaã nugget being the largest {{surviving}} natural nugget. Considered by most authorities {{to be the biggest}} gold nugget ever found, the Welcome Stranger was found at Moliagul, Victoria, Australia in 1869 by John Deason and Richard Oates. It <b>weighed</b> <b>gross,</b> over [...] and returned over [...] net. [...] The Welcome Stranger is sometimes confused with the similarly named Welcome Nugget, which was found in June 1858 at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, Australia by the Red Hill Mining Company. The Welcome weighed [...] It was melted down in London in November 1859.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Lipoma of the {{adrenal gland}} is rare with a {{reported}} incidence of between 2 % to 4 %. Improved imaging techniques have helped in the diagnosis of these lesions. Case presentation We report an incidentally detected giant adrenal lipoma in a 43 -year-old Asian man with a six year history of hypertension. He had a myocardial infarction one year earlier, {{for which he was}} taking an antiplatelet agent in addition to antihypertensive medication. The tumor was detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and was a large, well-defined, altered signal intensity lesion 12 cm in size in the right suprarenal region. The tumor was resected laparoscopically and sent for histopathologic evaluation. It measured 15 cm × 11. 5 cm × 6. 5 cm on <b>gross</b> examination, <b>weighed</b> 810 g and had a homogenous yellow cut surface. The postoperative course was smooth. Microscopy revealed mature adipose tissue with myxoid degeneration. Over the course of a four month follow-up the patient recovered. Conclusion Giant lipoma of {{the adrenal gland}}, a benign tumor, is rare compared with myelolipoma. Improved radiologic modalities have led to increased reporting of these benign tumors. Laparoscopic removal of the tumor has helped in early recovery and in reinstating patients to normal lives. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the pathogenicity and immunosuppressive effects of GM- 97 strain of infectious bursal disease virus in commercial broiler chickens. A total of 500 broiler chickens were vaccinated with the virus through oral route at 10 and 17 days of age (102 - 103 EID 50 /dose). Chickens were also vaccinated with Newcastle disease virus (Hitchner B 1) orally at 14 and 21 days old. Chickens were euthanized (at 12, 14, 16, 20, 23, 26 days of age) after measuring body weight. Bursa of Fabricius was examined for any <b>gross</b> lesion, <b>weighed</b> and processed for histological investigations. Bursa to body weight ratio and bursal lesion scoring were made to evaluate pathogenicity of the virus. Blood samples were analyzed for antibody response to ND vaccine virus using HI test. Results showed that the GM- 97 strain of IBDV induced mild to moderate depletion of lymphoid cells in the center of bursal follicles and non-significant difference in bursa to body weight ratio amongst vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens. Chickens responded well to ND vaccine by mounting high level of serum NDV specific HI antibody titers. It can be concluded from the present study that GM- 97 strain of IBDV has mild pathogenicity but is not immunosuppressive...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{states now}} use {{electronic}} bypass systems (or AVI - Automatic Vehicle Identification) to alleviate {{some of the}} truck traffic through the weigh station. Some {{of the best known}} are PrePass, NORPASS and Drivewyze. The system may consist of equipment at the weigh station itself, as well as a truck mounted transponder or smartphone, usually placed {{on the inside of the}} windshield or on the dashboard. These are similar to transponders used for toll collection. Each transponder is directly registered to a specific truck, and contains a unique identification. The registration process propagates information such as carrier name, unit number, and elected <b>gross</b> weight to <b>weigh</b> stations. In addition, the system keeps a basic safety and compliance record for each vehicle. As a truck approaches a weigh station (approximately one mile before), an electronic [...] "reader" [...] on a boom over the freeway reads the information from the truck transponder. It also looks at the safety and compliance record on the database. A display shows the results to the weigh master, including the speed of the vehicle. The weigh master may have the system automatically determine if a truck needs to stop or may override the system. Approximately one-half to one full mile after passing under the [...] "reader", the truck will pass under another boom which has an electronic unit to send the transponder a signal. If the safety information is acceptable the truck may receive a green light and can continue without entering the weigh station at all. There are weight detecting devices in the roadway itself. A driver may get a red light. On these occasions, the truck must pull into the weigh station for the normal weigh-in procedure. The most common reason a truck is [...] "redlighted" [...] is a weight problem, or a random check. Each time a truck is randomly pulled in, it is noted in the system whether the driver was compliant or not during the check. This affects how often a truck (or different trucks from the same company) are pulled in. For example, a company which is very compliant with the law will probably only have 5% of its trucks [...] "redlighted." ...|$|R
