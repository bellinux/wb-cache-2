5|$|Eye <b>irritation</b> can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or {{submerged}} in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces <b>irritation</b> as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye <b>irritation.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive <b>irritation,</b> upper respiratory tract <b>irritation,</b> and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and <b>irritation</b> of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal <b>irritation</b> at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Prolonged skin {{contact with}} {{glacial acetic acid}} may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation {{exposure}} (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some <b>irritation</b> of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung <b>irritation</b> and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked <b>irritation</b> of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms include skin <b>irritations,</b> {{which may}} be itchy or painful, and are {{sometimes}} confused with hives. These <b>irritations</b> appear upon or shortly after exposure to sunlight, and may last from 1 to 7 days. Lesions have been photographed showing fluid-filled blisters.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Exposure {{to cement}} dust has been {{associated}} with deleterious health effects in humans. This study investigated whether residing near a cement factory increases the risk of <b>irritations</b> to the mucous membranes of the eyes and respiratory system. A cross sectional study was conducted in Freedom Compound, a community bordering a cement factory in Chilanga, Zambia and a control community, Bauleni, located 18 km from the cement plant. A modified American Thoracic Society questionnaire was administered to 225 and 198 respondents aged 15 – 59 years from Freedom and Bauleni, respectively, to capture symptoms of the <b>irritations.</b> Respondents from Freedom Compound, were more likely to experience the irritations; adjusted ORs 2. 50 (95 % CI: 1. 65, 3. 79), 4. 36 (95 % CI (2. 96, 6. 55)) and 1. 94 (95 % CI (1. 19, 3. 18)) for eye, nose and sinus membrane <b>irritations</b> respectively.
