40|$|Objective: This article {{aimed to}} examine {{the issue of whether}} the {{construct}} of Internet addiction represents a single entity or a spectrum of disorders. Method: A literature review was performed and a conceptual synthesis was proposed. Results: Most research supports the notion that Internet addiction is a spectrum of Internet-related disorders, which pertain to addictive online behaviours, such as gaming and sexual activities. Although there are certain similarities between these behaviours, they are often associated with different socio-demographic and psychological variables (e. g., motivations and psychopathological symptoms), suggesting entities that are related, but still distinct. As constructs, addictive online activities are generally less heterogeneous than addictive use of the Internet, i. e., Internet addiction. Conclusions: The umbrella term “Internet addiction” is inadequate because <b>it</b> <b>overlooks</b> <b>important</b> differences between various addictive online activities. However, it may be unrealistic to expect a demise of the term before determining more clearly the acceptable level of internal heterogeneity of the psychopathological constructs. ...|$|E
40|$|Enormous {{demands for}} online degrees in higher {{education}} have increased the pressure on universities to launch web courses and degrees quickly and, at times, without properly attending {{to the quality of}} these ventures. There is scarce research that defines which quality indicators are used to assess cyberlearning environments, how different stakeholders view the relative importance of these quality indicators in online graduate degree programs from fields like science and engineering that have a historical preference for formal program accreditation, and what practices are used in evaluating completely online graduate degree programs {{in higher education}}. This mixed methods study examined current practices in three established online degree programs in agriculture and engineering at the University of Illinois, identifying quality indicators and evaluation practices used with cyberlearning environments in these fields and comparing myriad stakeholder views regarding the value of these practices. Data collection in this study used a mixed-methods approach, including a combination of surveys (n = 107) and interviews (n = 27) with program administrators, faculty, and students, as well as a document review from the different programs. While most of the evaluation occurring in the programs is informal, analysis of the surveys, interviews, and documents collected from the programs revealed four key themes related to current evaluation practice including the use of: (a) informal feedback from the students and faculty, (b) student satisfaction surveys (i. e., ICES student feedback and department-specific and created satisfaction surveys), (c) student grades and performance information, and (d) the Committee on Extended Education and External Degrees (CEEED) process. There were a several challenges reported in using these strategies to evaluate quality, including lacking structured collection and reporting mechanisms, differing implementation levels in traditional and online courses, varying availability of data and student quality, lacking fidelity of information delivery and access, and changing survey forms. Also evident from study was that the implementation of these evaluation practices is occurring at varying levels which were categorized on a four-stage continuum of evaluation. The programs in this study are at or beginning {{to move out of the}} first evaluation stage of preservation, meaning that the administrators have an evaluation system that is focused on efficiency and on collecting student satisfaction ratings. In this evaluation stage, small improvements are made periodically in hopes of getting more efficiency out of the current system, but little is done to explore quality beyond student satisfaction. Thus, the evaluation is incomplete as <b>it</b> <b>overlooks</b> <b>important</b> issues like student learning outcomes, the teaching and learning process, faculty support, course structure, and others. A factor analysis was done to explore the dimensionality of the 72 items related to quality evaluation and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) program accreditation, from the 2009 National Research Council Study on the Quality of Traditional Programs, Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) Online Benchmark Study, and ABET Criterion Three Items for STEM programs, which resulted in 12 common quality indicators to determine program quality of STEM online programs. These 12 quality indicators included (a) diversity of students and faculty, (b) professional and scholarly productivity of faculty, (c) presence, accessibility, and articulation of evaluation activities, learning outcomes, and support information, (d) student knowledge of current practice, ethics, impact, and professional conduct in STEM, (e) student production of STEM capstone research projects, (f) customer service provided by the program, (g) student training in conducting scholarly research and access to university resources, (h) interaction between students with each other and the faculty, (i) comparable achievement profiles between entering online and traditional students, (j) faculty preparation to transition from traditional to online environments, (k) student persistence to degree completion, and (l) student success beyond graduation. Differences between stakeholders revealed that online students placed a statistically significant higher emphasis than faculty on the presence, accessibility, and articulation of evaluation activities, learning outcomes, and support information. Interviews revealed that the online students considered themselves to be “consumers” of the degree program, thereby increasing the need for identification of clearly defined “outcomes” or “competencies” that online students should be able to produce or demonstrate as a result of participation in the courses and degree program overall. The study concludes with implications on how online programs and evaluators can use the quality indicators to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current evaluation system and to define and develop their own evaluation procedures for richer understanding within and between institutions and departments...|$|E

40|$|According to Brandom’s {{conceptual}} role semantics, {{to grasp}} a concept involves {{a commitment to}} drawing certain inferences.

In this paper I discuss a problem of Brandom’s semantics allegedly exposed in an argument by Paul Boghossian against Dummett’s and Brandom’s substantive conception of meaning. I contend that Boghossian’s analysis is dubious because <b>it</b> <b>overlooks</b> an <b>important</b> difference between Dummett’s and Brandom’s positions related respectively to a monotonic and a non-monotonic view of the norm underwriting meaning...|$|R

This poses the challenge of overcoming the knowledge gap of students, which we address by means of a synergistic cooperation of CS experts and educators.

40|$|An {{influential}} {{school of}} thought views the current international monetary and financial system as Bretton Woods reborn. Today, like 40 years ago, the international monetary system is composed of a core, which has the exorbitant privilege of issuing the currency used as international reserves, and a periphery, which is committed to export led growth based on the maintenance of an undervalued exchange rate. Then as now there is the same old core, the United States, but a new periphery, Asia. This view suggests that the current pattern of international settlements can be maintained indefinitely. In particular, {{there is no reason}} why the dollar must fall, since there is no need for balance of payments adjustment, and since the Asian countries will resist appreciation of their currencies of the greenback. In this paper I argue that this image of a new Bretton Woods System confuses the incentives that confront individual countries with those that confront groups of countries. <b>It</b> also <b>overlooks</b> <b>important</b> ways in which the world has changed since 1960. This alternative model suggests that if there indeed exists something resembling the Bretton Woods System, it does not have long to run.

40|$|This article {{defends the}} {{controversial}} existence of criminal liability for corporations by showing how, when a corporation commits a crime, it imposes additional harms on its victims which flow specifically {{from the nature}} of the corporate structure itself and therefore cannot be vindicated solely through the punishment of individual employees. First, I examine the current debate on corporate criminal liability and argue that <b>it</b> <b>overlooks</b> the <b>important</b> question of whether there is a difference in kind, as opposed to simply degree, which distinguishes corporate crime from individual crime and therefore justifies allegedly “redundant” punishment. Second, I use the example of the crime of bribery to demonstrate how {{the nature of the}} wrong it punishes relates to the networks bribery creates to consolidate power—real and perceived—over other market participants, and the attendant social malaise that results from the corruption of these networks. Third, I marshal psychological, sociological, and narrative evidence suggesting that the same perceptual harms caused by corporate acts of bribery are frequently at work in less obvious ways whenever a corporation commits a crime. I argue that upon this basis, and under circumstances in which a showing of corporate mens rea is possible, that corporate criminal liability should be available. Finally, I argue that, notwithstanding these strong arguments for corporate criminal liability, the bribery cases also demonstrate how the dramatic and variable role of prosecutorial discretion in attaching official blame to corporate harm runs the risk of undermining the expressive value of corporate punishment through an emphasis on consequentialist outcomes. These outcomes, I argue, improperly aggrandize the prosecutor’s ex post remedial role at the expense of redressing the underlying corporate harm...|$|R

40|$|Minimalism is a theory, of {{increasing}} {{popularity in the}} United States in recent decades, that requires the judiciary to base its decisions on the most limited grounds available. One of its central tenets dictates that the judiciary, if at all possible, should base its rulings on statutory rather than constitutional grounds.

Supreme Court decisions regarding the rights of prisoners held in Guantdnamo, this Article seeks to identify the pitfalls of such an approach to judicial decisionmaking. Specifically, it shows how minimalism has led to legislative enactments that deprive the prisoners of basic rights and that, as a practical matter, compromise the capacity of the Supreme Court ever to adequately address the prisoners 2 ̆ 7 claims. Although minimalism has been defended on the ground that it furthers democratic values, such a view reduces democracy to majoritarianism as opposed to a broad-based deliberative process that gives content to the fundamental values of the nation. <b>It</b> also <b>overlooks</b> the <b>important</b> and constructive role of the judiciary in that process...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of a sustainable transport system is the main objective of European transport policy. This system should encourage facilities to connect all people and should be linked with economic, social and environmental aspects of society. Current trends and future challenges will meet a growing "accessibility" demand, highlighting concerns about the sustainability of transport. Therefore one of the priorities of transport policy is the improving of overall quality of transport, including aspects related to: personal safety, accidents and health hazards reduction, protection of passengers rights and of accessibility to remote areas. This paper is dedicated to sustainable development, with particular attention to urban transport and to daily mobility of citizens. It is important to analyze all the aspects that {{make it possible to}} clarify a definition of "sustainable transport". Their analysis has {{to be related to the}} individuation of a set of indicators that simultaneously take into account the three dimensions of sustainability: environment, economy and social issues. This, set should help to take decisions on policy and planning of urban transport systems. A limited and easily available set of indicators is more convenient to be used, but <b>it</b> may <b>overlook</b> <b>important</b> impacts, thus distorting planning decisions. A broad set of indicators can propose more quality in terms of completeness, but it has characterized by incredible data collection costs and by serious difficulties of interpretation. This study is based on the results of a survey carried out to verify feasibility and usefulness of such indicators for sustainable urban mobility in a particular territory. Values assumed by economic, environmental and social indicators are referred to the city of Palermo. A survey on family shifts was carried out in this city. It aims to the {{creation of}} a set of indicators that would allow comparison between different urban transport strategies. Finally, we analyze the possibility to generalize the proposed set of indicators and the role that they could play in sustainable transport policies development and implementation, even in different urban contexts...|$|R
