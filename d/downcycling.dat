50|$|<b>Downcycling,</b> also {{referred}} to as cascading, describes the recycling of waste in cases where the recycled material is of lower quality and functionality than the original material.An important example of <b>downcycling</b> is the accumulation of tramp elements in secondary metals, which may exclude the latter from high-quality applications. Steel scrap from end-of-life vehicles, for example, is often contaminated with copper from wires and tin from coating.This contaminated scrap yields a secondary steel that does not meet the specifications for automotive steel and therefore, it is mostly applied in the construction sector.|$|E

(2015).They write that [...] "Poor product design and EOL management can lead to recycled materials of poor quality, which, in turn, limits the applications these materials can be used in." [...] They also argue that [...] "closed-loop recycling neither intrinsically displaces more primary material owing to multiple loops (quantity argument) nor per se generates higher environmental benefits on a unit basis (quality argument)." [...] The reason for their argument lies in the necessity to include the product system of the target application, in which the recycled material is used or not, into the assessment of overall primary material demand and environmental impact.|$|E

50|$|Recycling can {{contaminate}} {{workers and}} communities near recycling plants, {{as well as}} new materials, with halogenated flame retardants and their breakdown products. Electronic waste, vehicles, and other products are often melted to recycle their metal components, and such heating can generate toxic dioxins and furans. When wearing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and when a ventilation system is installed, exposure of workers to dust can be significantly reduced, as shown in the work conducted by the recycling plant Stena-Technoworld AB in Sweden. Brominated flame retardants may also change the physical properties of plastics, resulting in inferior performance in recycled products and in “downcycling” of the materials.

50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS) uses 25-35% recycled steel to {{make new}} steel.

40|$|Since over 90 % of C&DW {{consists}} of stony fraction (concrete, bricks and mixed aggregates), {{it can be}} reused as recycled aggregates in various applications after crushing. C&DW can serve as filling material in roads construction (low grade application) or as aggregates to make new construction materials (high grade application). Concrete Aggregates (CA) {{have the potential to}} be reused in high grade applications. However the current practices in recycling of C&DW do not separate CA from the bricks and the mixed fractions. This results in a low quality product which can be only used in low grade applications. This is called <b>downcycling,</b> so called because of the value gap between recycled concrete and its intrinsic value. The presented study aims to identify the key environmental gains and drawbacks when CA are recycled in high grade applications. Two different scenarios are analysed: downcycling- representing the current situation, in which CA are recycled in low grade applications (roads construction) and upcycling- where CA go through an advanced cleaning process that makes them suitable to be used in high grade applications (new concrete). Environmental performances of both scenarios have been evaluated using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The LCA study concluded that the upcycling scenario has slightly lower environmental impacts compared with the <b>downcycling</b> scenario. In addition to the slight environmental gain, the upcycling allows also to close the recycling loop for CA. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Emissions from {{production}} {{activities in the}} Swedish construction industry accounts for 17 % of national greenhouse gas emissions, making reduction possibilities of large interest and importance. Concerning construction of new buildings large improvements have been made regarding energy efficiency, putting further emphasizes on the production phase. Construction of timber residential buildings is growing internationally and in Sweden. The environmental potential of structural systems in timber is promising, although associated with certain design and production challenges. Therefore, a life cycle assessment looking into the potential of timber and concrete hybrid systems is of interest. The aim of the thesis is to identify viable hybrid solutions and map their environmental potential regarding climate change. A literature review covering relevant LCA methodology and scientific literature was carried out to form a theoretical base for the report. Findings strengthen the case of timber products emitting less greenhouse gases compared to concrete. However, both systems show large future reduction potential. A case study on a concrete reference house was carried out, substituting incrementally more concrete to CLT through five scenarios. A sensitivity analysis covering the potential of <b>downcycling</b> CLT, using cement replacing materials {{and the impact of}} different input data and transport distances for CLT was added to the case study. The discussion of the report mainly covers the result and its sensitivity. Further, the relevance of producing residential buildings with very long life spans, challenges constructing hybrid structural systems and important but omitted impact categories are discussed. Suggestion for key success factors going ahead with CLT and hybrid residential buildings are lastly given. The result from the case study show a clear correlation reduced concrete use and GWP reduction. A majority of the total buildings’ weight and emissions can be correlated to eleven material categories. Product development should be focused on these categories. <b>Downcycling</b> of CLT and using cement replacing materials show large potential for both timber and concrete system.

The research is based on a review of the contamination literature and case studies. We differentiate between three types of contamination influencing circular material flows: technical, which deals with fitness for use; systemic, which deals with efficiency in processing; and interaction, which deals with user-object interaction and decision making. Our focus is on developing a foundational understanding of contaminated interaction and how it influences circular processes. Through multiple examples, contaminated interaction is shown to create three barriers to the CE: <b>downcycling,</b> disposal, and hindered circulation.

While energetic and thermo-mechanical recycling entail <b>downcycling</b> of the material, chemical recycling requires considerable amounts of chemicals and demanding processing steps entailing toxic and ecological issues. This review provides a thorough survey of PET-recycling including energetic, material, thermo-mechanical and chemical methods. It focuses on chemical methods describing important reaction parameters and yields of obtained reaction products. While most methods yield monomers, only a few yield undefined low molecular weight oligomers for impaired applications (dispersants or plasticizers).

40|$|Abstract. The similar {{densities of}} {{polyethylene}} (PE) and polypropylene (PP), complicate the separation for these {{materials in the}} mechanical recycling of post-consumer plastics. Therefore, recycled mixed polyolefins (rMPO) are widely available as recycled (r) polymer material. These blends are commonly cheaper, but also inferior in properties to relatively pure waste streams of rPP or rPE. In order to improve these materials, blends of rMPO were made with more expensive, relatively high quality rPP. This approach was purposefully ‘bottom up’, exploring how to upcycle the lower grade rMPO instead of <b>downcycling</b> higher grade rPP {{with a measure of}} added (cheaper) rMPO. Blends were made with two types of rMPO, the one a HDPE-PP blends from hard plastic waste and the other a LDPE-HDPE-PP blends, based mostly on foil materials. Each of these materials had one type of mechanical property in common with the high quality rPP, these being Young’s modulus and toughness respectively. Blends were made at different concentrations (0 - 50 % in steps of 10 %) and injection moulded into test samples. Density, MFI, mechanical strength, impact toughness and transition temperatures were experimentally determined for each blend.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} interactions between life cycle emissions and materials flows associated with lightweighting (LW) automobiles. Both aluminum and high-strength steel (HSS) lightweighting are considered, with LW ranging from 6 % to 23 % {{on the basis of}} literature references and input from industry experts. We compare the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with producing lightweight vehicles with the saved emissions during vehicle use. This yields a calculation of how many years of vehicle use are required to offset the added GHG emissions from the production stage. Payback periods for HSS are shorter than for aluminum. Nevertheless, achieving significant LW with HSS comparable to aluminum-intensive vehicles requires not only material substitution but also the achievement of secondary LW by downsizing of other vehicle components in addition to the vehicle structure. GHG savings for aluminum LW varies strongly with location where the aluminum is produced and whether secondary aluminum can be utilized instead of primary. HSS is less sensitive to these parameters. In principle, payback times for vehicles lightweighted with aluminum can be shortened by closed-loop recycling of wrought aluminum (i. e., use of secondary wrought aluminum). Over a 15 -year time horizon, however, it is unlikely that this could significantly reduce emissions from the automotive industry, given the challenges involved with enabling a closed-loop aluminum infrastructure without <b>downcycling</b> automotive body structures...|$|E

40|$|It is undisputed {{that the}} {{recycling}} of aluminium is desirable {{as long as}} the environmental and economic implications of its reintegration do not exceed the burdens of its primary production. The efficiency of any aluminium recycling system can be expressed by the total material losses throughout the entire process chain, ideally reaching 0 %, thus equivalent to 100 % metal recovery. However, in most cases metals are recycled in open/cascade recycling loop where dilution and quality losses occur. Innovations in aluminium beverage can (ABC) design as well as in sorting and recycling technologies have the potential to increase recyclability and avoid <b>downcycling</b> issues due to mixed alloy scrap streams. By means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) seven scenarios, comprising specific systemic changes, are compared to the current recycling practice of the used beverage can in the UK. The End-of-Life modelling of recycling is performed in accordance with the equal share method to account for impacts both on the recyclability and the recycled content. The results confirm the primary aluminium production and energy consumption in the ABC production as the hotspots in the life cycle of the ABC. The toxicity and energy-related impact categories show the highest susceptibility to increasing recycled content and recycling rate, while the technological novelties show little effect. In terms of abiotic resource depletion the introduction of novel technologies could have the potential to retain quality of the aluminium alloys by either establishing dedicated waste streams or upgrading the aluminium scrap by dedicated sorting strategies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry generates {{large amounts of}} waste, usually mixed, which can be composed of different origin materials, most of them catalogued as non-hazardous. The European Union targets for this waste for 2020 have been already achieved by the UK, but it is mainly developed in <b>downcycling</b> processes (backfilling) whereas upcycling (such as recycle in new concrete batches) still keeps at a low percentage. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore further in the use of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) in concrete mixes so as to improve upcycling. A review of most recent research and legislation applied in the UK is developed regarding the production of concrete blocks. As a case study, initial tests were developed with a CDW recycled aggregate sample from a CDW plant in Swansea. Composition by visual inspection and sieving tests of two samples were developed and compared to original aggregates. More than 70 % was formed by soil waste from excavation, and the rest was a mix of waste from mortar, concrete, and ceramics with small traces of plaster, glass and organic matter. Two concrete mixes were made with 80 % replacement of recycled aggregates and different water/cement ratio. Tests were carried out for slump, absorption, density and compression strength. The results were compared to a reference sample and showed a substantial reduction of quality in both mixes. Despite that, the discussion brings to identify different aspects to solve, such as heterogeneity or composition, and analyze them for the successful use of these recycled aggregates in the production of concrete blocks. The conclusions obtained can help increase upcycling processes ratio with mixed CDW as recycled aggregates in concrete mixes...|$|E
40|$|On {{a global}} level the {{population}} growth and increase {{of the middle class}} lead to a growing demand on material resources. The built environment has an enormous impact on this scarcity. In addition, a surplus of construction and demolition waste is a common problem. The construction industry claims to recycle 95 % of this waste but this is in fact mainly <b>downcycling.</b> Towards the circular economy, the quality of reuse becomes of increasing importance. Buildings are material warehouses that can contribute to this high quality reuse. However, several aspects to achieve this are unknown and a need for more insight into the potential for high quality reuse of building materials exists. Therefore an instrument has been developed that determines the circularity of construction waste in order to maximise high quality reuse. The instrument is based on three principles: ‘product and material flows in the end of life phase’, ‘future value of secondary materials and products’ and ‘the success of repetition in a new life cycle’. These principles are further divided into a number of criteria to which values and weighting factors are assigned. A degree of circularity can then be determined as a percentage. A case study for a typical 70 s building is carried out. For concrete, the circularity is increased from 25 % to 50 % by mapping out the potential for high quality reuse. During the development of the instrument it was clarified that some criteria are difficult to measure. Accurate and reliable data are limited and assumptions had to be made. To increase the reliability of the instrument, experts have reviewed the instrument several times. In the long-term, the instrument {{can be used as a}} tool for quantitative research to reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste and contribute to the reduction of raw material scarcity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis argues {{the need}} for a {{fundamental}} shift from the design of products to the design of possessions in the circular economy. Possessions in the circular economy are characterised by interactions resulting in a user-object relationship rather than legalese and differ from the linear economy in terms of their length of use and number of users. Individual users are thus seen as critical actors to enable material circulation in that they take possession and dispossess of products. Two key topics—psychological ownership and contaminated interaction—are explored in detail to fill theoretical gaps in design research and practice. After discussing these topics, some directions and guidelines are suggested. Possession or ownership is taken as an innate human desire. A framework describes the method of developing ownership including the motives, routes, and paths that guide the development of that relationship. This framework is used to describe object attachment to inform product longevity and decisions around keeping and discarding. It is also useful to help explain why some access-based models are adopted while others are not. Maintaining perceived value in the circular economy entails mitigating contaminated interaction—tainted interaction due to prior use and prior users. Contaminated interaction is shown to affect new circular business opportunities, disposal decisions and <b>downcycling.</b> A typology is presented to characterise indicators of use with an emphasis on sensorial material properties. Aversion to used products is found to come from three drivers: hygiene, utility and territory. A theoretical framework for contaminated interaction is presented which is explored through positive and negative forms of contamination. Finally, a case study shows how alterations in product characteristics lead to improper disposal and act as an example {{of what it means to}} design of circular possessions. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{motivation}} Building industry impacts natural cycles and has potential for optimization. While impairment on nature reached {{a new dimension}} already some three centuries ago the building industry started to realize the dependency {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century. With LCA method all life cycle phases can be monitored and the environmental impact of each can be quantified. The energy consuming and emission generating components in the building context can be distinguished in the groups transport, operation and material. An architect deals with the operational energy and the building substance. With nearly zero (not renewable) energy for operation an ecological building is defined by the building substance. Evaluation of the building substance While the building structure accounts for the highest share of embodied energy and GWP, the facade offers high potential for optimisation. This potential is even higher when considering a long (50 - 100 years) usage life span; the building structure remains while the (non load-bearing) facade is object to exchange cycles. Findings and their integration into the architectural planning process The city is a depot for resources and we (it involves a variety of professions) need to learn how to organize it. Modularity, light construction, the use of renewable materials and mono materials are also interesting fields which are looked at from a different point of view. They are relevant for all building elements. Although they are not initially invented to reduce the ecological impact of the built environment, they show potential to do so. The facade is the essential parameter for the resource-efficiency of a building as it is exchanged and binds relevant amounts of material. Impact can be made within this element due to its high variation in construction and materialization. The material cycles need to become smaller and the gaps – landfill or <b>downcycling</b> need to be closed. The use of resources will increasingly develop impact on architecture and by that resource efficiency is a successor of energy efficiency...|$|E
