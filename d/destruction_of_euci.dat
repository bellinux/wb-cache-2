40|$|In this thesis, I problematize a {{widespread}} assumption in theories of civil disobedience. The {{assumption is that}} <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> property is violence.

I put forth three sufficient criteria for viewing <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> property as violence {{and use them to}} evaluate two representative cases of civil disobedience in Denmark. I conclude that <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> property can be viewed as violence in cases where it results in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations of the right to private property. However, the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> property most common to civil disobedience does not result in significant physical or psychological damage to persons or substantial violations of property rights, and thus cannot reasonably be considered violence. <b>Destruction</b> <b>of</b> property, as it relates to civil disobedience, can therefore not be unquestionably viewed as violence...|$|R
