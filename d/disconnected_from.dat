5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> one bogie, and for one hour if <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains {{run on the}} sidings {{which were}} <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line passing through it, used for {{occasional}} special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly landfill trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former brick pits at Calvert.|$|E

5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on new land.|$|E

5|$|In Han's wake, other {{cultural}} figures, like Ch'oe Sŭnghŭi and Sim Yŏng, were purged also. The regime faced {{a problem in}} Han's work being politically useful in nature but his name tarnished. His name began to be <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> his work, which was still widely disseminated. For the future, North Korean publishing authorities would employ a policy of publishing collective works of creative teams and withhold names of individual authors, a practice that was observed particularly in the 1970s and started to wane only in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Located on an embankment, {{the station}} has four tracks {{with only the}} two outer ones in revenue service. The two center express tracks have been <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the line and have {{permanently}} been removed from service. North of this station, {{a portion of the}} southbound express track connects with the southbound local track at its north end, and ends at a bumper block at its southern end. This section of track can be used for revenue service or work train layups, but this use has been made completely redundant because of the nearby Pitkin Yard serving as the primary layup yard instead.|$|E
5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment of its current route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the rest of M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E

5|$|Once General Tire {{sold the}} network in 1957, Mutual's {{ownership}} was largely <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the stations it served, {{leading to a}} more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual {{as a vehicle for}} foreign propaganda. The network's reputation was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years—even leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased Mutual in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} and characters of each worlds {{were designed to}} resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, {{and with the}} game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game {{would not be as}} entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.|$|E

5|$|The same {{development}} {{team that}} worked on Four Swords Adventures also worked {{on what would}} become Phantom Hourglass. In the game's first prototype, the action {{took place in the}} upper screen while the touchscreen was a flat map that allowed Link to be controlled. However, the developers believed that this interface caused the player to be too <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the game's action, thereby prompting them to switch the two screens. They felt that this interface would appeal to Japanese players, who they said prefer simple interfaces. The developers added a battle mode that was played over Wi-Fi to appeal to American players.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} depicts {{the lives of}} six individuals, {{including}} Jackson, who are left isolated and <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the world around them. This is Jackson's lowest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 91, though charted in the top 10 in numerous countries worldwide, including Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The song {{was performed on the}} HIStory World Tour in 1996–1997. It was covered a few times by other artists.|$|E
5|$|While other closed {{stations}} on {{the former}} MR lines north of Aylesbury were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971 the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was maintained in working order and used as a bookshop and ticket office, and the sidings—still intact, although <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the railway line in 1967—were used for locomotive restoration work.|$|E

5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the car is}} <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest}} of the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder {{questions}} the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|M-32 {{was formed}} as a state {{trunkline}} in 1919 along its present routing between M-13 (now US131) and M-10 (later US23, now M-65) near Lachine. In 1933, M-32 was extended westerly along M-131 and then to M-66 in East Jordan. The concurrency along M-131 would remain when US 131 replaced it in 1939. Another change in that year came on the eastern end when US23 was realigned north of Alpena. M-32 took over the US23 routing between Lachine and Alpena. M-32 was extended along M-66 to Charlevoix from 1964 until 1974. Bus. M-32 was <b>disconnected</b> <b>from</b> M-32 when the latter was realigned in Hillman in 1994.|$|E
