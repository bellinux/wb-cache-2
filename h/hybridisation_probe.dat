40|$|Enkephalins are pentapeptides with opioid {{activity}} {{which are}} found {{in a wide variety}} of tissues. Studies of enkephalin-containing peptides from the adrenal gland have established that the mature pentapeptides are derived by proteolytic processing of a precursor protein. We have shown that human adrenal medullary tumours contain mRNA which can be translated in vitro to yield a single major enkephalin precursor. The sequence of cloned cDNA shows that the preproenkephalin mRNA encodes four copies of met-enkephalin, two copies of met-enkephalin extended sequences and one copy of leu-enkephalin; each copy is flanked by paired basic amino acids which are presumably recognised by the processing protease.

40|$|A cDNA {{encoding}} {{the precursor}} of the bovine mitochondrial phosphate carrier protein has been cloned from a bovine cDNA library using {{a mixture of}} 128 different 17 -mer oligonucleotides as <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe.</b> The protein has an N-terminal extension of 49 amino acids not present in the mature protein. This extension has a net positive charge and is presumed to direct the import of the protein from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion. Comparison of the protein sequence of the mature phosphate carrier with itself, with ADP/ATP translocase and with the uncoupling protein from brown fat mitochondria shows that all three proteins contain a 3 -fold repeated sequence approximately 100 amino acids in length, and that the repeats in the three proteins are related to each other. This implies that the three proteins have related three-dimensional structures and mechanisms and that they share a common evolutionary origin. The distribution of hydrophobic residues in the phosphate carrier protein suggests that each repeated 100 amino acid element is composed of two membrane-spanning alpha-helices linked by an extensive hydrophilic domain.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} single-stranded <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> for the oestrogen receptor mRNA was synthesised using T 3 polymerase from oestrogen receptor cDNA cloned in the Bluescript vector. This probe {{was used}} to measure oestrogen receptor mRNA in total RNA extracted from breast tumours. Oestrogen receptor mRNA was detected in 41 of 47 (87 %) tumours whereas cytosolic oestrogen receptor protein was detected in only 18 out of 39 (46 %). There was a significant correlation between the levels of the oestrogen receptor, as measured by 3 H-oestradiol binding, and the oestrogen receptor mRNA. Oestrogen receptor mRNA was detected in 15 of the 21 tumours that did not contain detectable oestrogen receptor protein. This suggests that detection of the mRNA is a more sensitive means for establishing oestrogen receptor status than the radioligand oestrogen receptor assay. Oestrogen receptor mRNA was found in all histological tumour types examined. Its level was related to tumour differentiation. All the tumours that did not contain oestrogen receptor mRNA and most of the tumours that contained only low levels of oestrogen receptor mRNA were classified as grade III according to Bloom and Richardson: the median of the oestrogen receptor mRNA levels was significantly lower in this group...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} an {{increasingly}} significant cause of mortality whose risk {{is linked to}} diet and inversely correlated with cruciferous vegetable consumption. This {{is likely to be}} partly attributable to the isothiocyanates derived from eating these vegetables, such as sulforaphane, which is extensively characterised for cytoprotective and tumour-suppressing activities. However, its bioactivities are likely to extend in complexity beyond those currently known; further insight into these bioactivities could aid the development of sulforaphane-based chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic strategies. Evidence suggests that sulforaphane modulates the expression of microRNAs, many of which are known to regulate genes involved at various stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. Based upon existing knowledge, there exist many plausible mechanisms by which sulforaphane may regulate microRNAs. Thus, there is a strong case for the further investigation of the roles of microRNAs in the anti-cancer effects of sulforaphane. There are several different types of approach to the wide-scale profiling of microRNA differential expression. Array-based methods may involve the use of RT-qPCR or complementary <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> chips, and tend to be relatively fast and economical.

Of the 5 described species that contribute to the majority of human infections, C. parvum is of major interest due to its zoonotic potential. A species-specific fluorescence in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> was designed to the variable region in the small subunit of the 18 S rRNA of C. parvum and labeled with Cy 3. Probe specificity was validated against a panel of 7 other Cryptosporidium spp. before it was applied to 33 human faecal samples positive for cryptosporidiosis which were obtained during the period from 2006 - 2007. Results were compared to PCR-RFLP targeting the 18 S rDNA. FISH results revealed that 19 of the 33 isolates analysed were identified as C. parvum. Correlation of PCR-RFLP and FISH was statistically significant (P < 0. 05), resulting in a calculated correlation coefficient of 0. 994. In this study, species identification by FISH and PCR-RFLP provided preliminary evidence to support both anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission of sporadic cases of cryptosporidiosis in the Sydney basin. In conclusion, FISH using a C. parvum-specific probe provided an alternative tool for accurate identification of zoonotic Cryptosporidium which will be applied in the future to both epidemiological and outbreak investigations. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial canker {{has been}} {{severely}} affecting wild cherry trees (Prunus avium) and restraining the planting of this valuable hardwood {{for the last}} 13 years. The disease {{has been attributed to}} the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. morsprunorum, which has caused bacterial canker in sweet cherry since at least the beginning of this century. Twenty-four wild cherry sites were investigated. From eight it was possible to isolate a total of 23 cultures. These were used to test rapid diagnostic techniques in conjunction with 52 other cultures obtained from different sources. Two of the wild cherry cultures were obtained from a nursery, which is of grave concern. The diagnostic techniques tested were based on nutritional tests (Biolog system), nucleic acids (DNA <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> and REP-PCR), and immunology (slide immunofluorescence and conjugated Staphylococcus aureus agglutination). The Biolog system could identify the bacteria at the species level and allowed a numerical taxonomy study. In this, three clusters were seen, one of P. s. pv. syringae isolates, another of P. s. pv. morsprunorum isolates, and a last one of intermediate isolates, including most of the cultures isolated from wild cherry. These cultures were also intermediate in classical nutritional tests that usually discriminate the two pathovars. It is suggested that the wild cherry cultures are an intermediate form, not yet stabilised. They {{should be included in the}} P. syringae pv. syringae rather than in P. s. pv. morsprunorum until more taxonomic work is done. A DNA <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> obtained from other workers failed to react with some P. s. pv. morsprunorum cultures, possibly because only part of the original probe could be used. Again almost none of the cultures from wild cherry hybridised. Although REP-PCR was too variable to allow identification of P. s. pv. syringae, it could be used to distinguish it from typical P. s. pv. morsprunorum. Again the wild cherry cultures had very different patterns from the ones obtained from P. s. pv. morsprunorum. The immunofluorescence did not have enough specificity to discriminate pathovars or even species but the same antiserum worked well in the conjugated S. aureus agglutination test. The spatial and temporal spread of P. s. pv. morsprunorum replicated in simulated plantations containing single inoculated trees was evaluated. The results suggest that epiphytic forms were ubiquitous and that the spacing between trees was unimportant. One year was enough for a plantation, which was initially free of the bacteria to acquire a population almost equivalent to an inoculated plantation. Single isolates of P. s. pv. morsprunorum, with REP-PCR patterns stable in culture, apparently gave rise to isolates with different patterns within one year of inoculation. The strategy of planting clonal cherry material, supposedly resistant to bacterial canker, can become very risky because of the high phenotypic and genetic variation of P. syringae isolated from wild cherry trees, which was demonstrated by the diagnostic techniques...|$|E
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Mycobacterium are major {{pathogens}} of man and animals. Tuberculosis causes almost 3 million deaths per year, currently making it {{the leading cause of}} death among bacterial infectious diseases. However, our knowledge of these pathogens is limited. This thesis investigated two questions (i) the role of mycobacterial catalases in isoniazid sensitivity, and (ii) the presence of an acid tolerance response. The mycobacterial M-catalase is thought to play a role in isoniazid sensitivity. Bacterial catalase enzymes are highly conserved at the amino acid level. An experimental strategy to clone the mycobacterial M- catalase gene sought to exploit this feature. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed, based on previously cloned catalase genes, in an attempt to amplify the mycobacterial catalase gene using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Despite repeated attempts, this approach was unsuccessful. An attempt to identify the gene from a mycobacterial library using the catalase gene of Escherichia coli (katE) as a <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> also failed. Resistance to acidic environmental conditions is important for many mycobacterial species. Evidence was sought for the existence of an adaptive acid tolerance mechanism in the mycobacteria. To identify any genes that showed increased transcription in response to a decrease in extracellular pH, a promoter probe library was constructed with bacterial luciferase as the reporter. A clone (pSGA 197) was identified that showed increased bioluminescence at the adaptive pH. The mycobacterial DNA insert in this clone was sequenced. Examination of the sequence revealed that the insert's putative acid-regulated promoter was located downstream from an open reading frame that coded for a possible sensor-kinase protein...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{research on}} new capillary electrophoresis (CE) based rRNA fingerprint approaches for characterisation of low diversity microbial communities. In the first body of work, {{an alternative approach}} for sieving polymer synthesis through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation is presented. Sieving polymer matrices are typically synthesised by conventional free radical polymerisation. This thesis describes the first synthesis of a high molecular weight poly(n,n-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) in which both the molar mass and polydispersity distribution were controlled by RAFT polymerisation. A multi-step chain extension is detailed and the physical properties and separation performance of DNA/RNA using this RAFT polymer are described. The second body of work deals {{with the development of}} new approach for characterisation of microbial communities using CE. The new approach involves conformational separation of microbial 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules containing the highly variable regions present in 16 S rRNA. Single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) is a separation technique based on the principle that for nucleic acid fragments of equal lengths, variation in sequences can affect nucleic acid folding and hence can be separated due to the difference in electrophoretic mobility. While CE DNA-SSCP has been commonly applied in clinical mutation diagnostic tests and studies of microbial diversity, CE rRNA-SSCP has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, an enzymatic based RNA-oligonucleotide cleavage method was employed to cleave the 16 S rRNA (1542 bases) to smaller fragments of similar length (340 bases). This strategy uses a eubacterial ‘scissor’ probe to target and hybridise highly conserved sites within the rRNA flanking highly variable regions (e. g. V 1, V 2 or V 3). As rRNA is synthesised only by actively-growing cells, together with its role as the marker molecule for assigning sequences to genera and species, it can thus be used to correlate to the functioning members of microbial communities. Taking advantage of these unique properties, CE-rRNA-SSCP circumvents the need for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and retains the quantitative information regarding to the evenness of the microbial community that is important for ecological studies that were otherwise lost during PCR step. Compared to gel electrophoresis based approach, CE- rRNA SSCP significantly decreased the analysis time from 24 hours to 60 min and the use of a fluorescently labelled <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> for detection decreased the sample requirement by ten-fold. The combination of fast analysis time, low sample requirement and sensitive fluorescence detection makes CE-rRNA-SSCP an appealing new approach for characterising low diversity microbial communities. The third body of work deals with the conception and development of a novel characterisation approach termed multiplex cleavage microbial community analysis (MCMCA), which is a potential method to simultaneously link the phylogeny of multiple groups of metabolically active microorganisms to their respective metabolic activity and relative abundance within a community. MCMCA utilizes the similar sequence-specific cleavage of rRNA molecules with oligonucleotides and RNase H employed in previous approach but differs by the use of multiple taxon specific probes selected to specifically cut the 16 S rRNA into discrete fragments varying in length. The cleaved rRNA mixture is subsequently mixed with a fluorescently labelled locked nucleic acid (LNA) universal <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> and resolved using denaturing CE size separation. The feasibility of this rational is tested using model microbial strains, followed by optimisation of the cleavage procedure to achieve multiplex cleavage in a model microbial community. This approach was then applied to characterise a hydrocarbon degrading enrichment community derived from soil...|$|E
40|$|In some {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae the {{mitochondrial}} gene coding for 21 S rRNA {{is interrupted by}} an intron of 1143 bp. This intron contains a reading frame for 235 amino acids: Unassigned Reading Frame (URF). In order to check whether expression of this URF is required for proper splicing of precursors to 21 S rRNA, the precision of RNA splicing was analysed in a petite mutant, where no mitochondrial protein synthesis is possible anymore. We have devised a new assay to monitor the precision of the splicing event. The method is of general application, provided that the sequence of the splice boundaries is known. In {{the case of the}} 21 S rRNA it involves the synthesis of the DNA oligonucleotide d(CGATCCCTATTGTC(complementary to the 5 ' d(CGATCCCTAT) and 3 ' d(TGTC) borders flanking the intron in the 21 S rRNA gene. The oligonucleotide is labelled with 32 p at the 5 '-end, hybridised to RNA and subsequently subjected to digestion with S 1 nuclease. Resistance to digestion will only be observed if the correct splice-junction is made. The petite mutant we have studied contains a 21 S rRNA with the same migration behaviour as wildtype 21 S rRNA. In RNA blotting experiments, using an intron specific <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe,</b> the same intermediates in splicing are found both in wild type and petite mutant. Finally the synthetic oligonucleotide hybridises to petite 21 S rRNA and its thermal dissociation behaviour is indistinguishable from a hybrid formed with wildtype 21 S rRNA.

They possess an RNA N-glycosidase activity whereby the removal of a specific adenine residue from 28 S RNA renders a eukaryotic ribosome inactive. Type II RIPS contain both an active polypeptide and a sugar-binding polypeptide. Type I RIPs are composed of a single polypeptide functionally homologous to the active type II polypeptide. This thesis describes studies of the gene sequences of RIPs representative of each class: Ricin, a type II RIP from the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis h.), and saporin, a type I RIP from soapwort (Saponaria officinalis L.). Two ricin gene sequences were isolated from a Ricinus genomic library and partially characterised. One gene was a badly damaged ricin-like pseudogene whilst the other was shown to encode an active polypeptide. A second ricin sequence encoding an active polypeptide was isolated using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PGR) DNA amplification. The specificity of PGR amplification was investigated using the ricin and related agglutinin gene sequences. Partial amino acid sequence data derived from protein sequencing of saporin- 6 was used to synthesise degenerate inosine-containing oligonucleotides. These directed the PGR amplification of part of the saporin coding sequence from genomic DNA. The product was used as a saporin-specific <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe.</b> Southern analysis of Saponaria genomic DNA indicated that saporin sequences comprised a small multigene family. Three independent saporin containing genomic clones were isolated from a Saponaria genomic library. Two clones were truncated whilst the third contained a complete saporin coding sequence.

Aniline cleavage assays of ribosomal RNA extracted from ribosomes exposed to the products of the RIP coding sequences were carried out.

Objectives: To clone and sequence the cDNA encoding lamellar MMP- 2, develop antibody and in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probes</b> to locate lamellar MMP- 2 and quantitate MMP- 2 transcription in normal and laminitis tissue. Methods: Total RNA was isolated, fragmented by RT-PCR, cloned into vector and sequenced. Rabbit anti-equine MMP- 2 and labelled MMP- 2 riboprobe were developed to analyse and quantitate MMP- 2 expression. Results: Western immunoblotting with anti-MMP- 2 detected 72 kDa MMP- 2 in hoof tissue homogenates and cross-reacted with human MMP- 2. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation detected MMP- 2 in the cytoplasm of basal and parabasal cells in close proximity to the lamellar basement membrane. Northern analysis and quantitative real-time PCR showed MMP- 2 expression significantly (...|$|R
40|$|Abstract New rapid {{methods for}} {{sensitive}} and specific detection of pneumococci {{are not only}} needed to improve the diagnosis of pneumococcal disease but are also essential for vaccine and carriage studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop sensitive PCR methods for the detection and quantification of S. pneumoniae and to study the applicability of these methods to detecting pneumococci in clinical samples. A previously described PCR method was first developed further by introducing a Europium-labelled <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> for the detection of amplification products. The hybridisation method was easy to use and improved the specificity of the PCR assay. The developed PCR assay was established as a sensitive method for detecting pneumococcal DNA when the presence of pneumococcal DNA in over 2500 middle ear fluid (MEF) samples of children with acute otitis media (AOM) was studied by using the method. Pneumococcal findings increased by 76 % when using PCR detection in addition to culture, compared to using culture alone. However, the PCR-positive, culture-negative AOM events represented a less severe type of disease compared to the culture-positive events. A positive PCR finding seems to indicate the presence of viable, although often non-culturable pneumococci within the middle ear cleft. To be able to rapidly detect and quantify the initial numbers of pneumococcal genome copies in clinical samples, a real-time PCR method for the detection and quantification of pneumococcal DNA was developed. In real-time PCR, amplification and detection of amplification products occur simultaneously, which makes it possible to monitor the phase of the reaction at a particular stage or continuously. The method developed here was applied to the analysis of MEF samples and to investigating the nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus. The sensitivities of bacterial culture and real-time PCR in detecting pneumococci were also compared. The real-time PCR assay was found to be rapid and sensitive and to provide information about the differences between the numbers of bacteria in samples. However, the quantitative results were shown to be dependent on the DNA extraction method applied. The real-time PCR method developed appears to be a good aid in research where an accurate and sensitive pneumococcal diagnosis is needed...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of the {{distribution}} of Mycoplasma suis and comparing investigations of real-time PCR and acridine orange-stained blood smears concerning sensitivity and specificity As the porcine Eperythrozoonosis is most commonly a latent chronic infection, a high sensitive assay is required to evaluate {{the distribution}} of Mycoplasma suis in Germany. Due to its high sensitivity and specificity the real-time PCR was chosen for this study. In comparison to conventional PCR assays the real-time PCR is a rapid, easy-doing, more accurate and more sensitive system. In the present study the prevalence of M. suis in Germany was measured by using the LightCycler® System and a constant real-time PCR-protocol. Additionally a new method of DNA-Extraction, the Gen Elute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit, was evaluated during this study. The Gen Elute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit showed the same results concerning sensitivity and efficiency of DNA extraction as the automatical extraction with the MagNA Pure LCTM System. 1176 blood samples of slaughtered post-weaning pigs from 196 different pig herds were collected. In addition to PCR analysis a haemogram was made from any sample and clinicochemical parameter were determined. Moreover an acridine orange-stained blood smear was analysed from each sample. Real-time PCR showed a positive result for 164 out of 1176 samples (13, 9 %). With the acridine stain only 35 pigs were identified as infected with M. suis. 31 of these samples were also positive in the real-time PCR. In the present study microscopic examination on stained blood smears only detected M. suis infections with a bacterial load of at least 105 per ml blood. 80 (40, 8 %) out of 196 pig herds were detected positive for M. suis by real-time PCR. The number of M. suis infected herds in the different districts of Germany varied from 33, 3 % to 48 %. The prevalence within one herd varried from 25 % to 46, 2 % and showed an average value of 34, 2 %. A significant correlation between the bacterial load per ml blood and the degree of severity of anemia was shown. A decrease of the number of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit was observed when the bacterial load increased. By comparing real-time PCR and microscopic examination of acridine orange-stained blood smears it was shown that the real-time PCR system is able to detect even latent M. suis infections that are missed out in the microscopic examination. Furthermore immature erythrocytes and Howell-Jolly-bodies may lead to false positive results. With the use of the M. suis specific <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe</b> system in the real-time PCR false positive results can be avoided. The LightCycler® MSG 1 protocol {{has proven to be a}} high sensitive and easy-doing system that allows the integration in routine laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Relative DNA homologies were {{determined}} among 24 strains of fast-growing rhizobia and 26 strains of slow-growing rhizobia with particular reference to those which nodulate Lotus species. Two major DNA homology groups were identified which shared less than 10 % relative DNA homology. Fast-growing Lotus rhizobia were grouped with related fast-growing strains in DNA homology group I, and these strains are designated as Rhizobium loti. Slow-growing strains from Lotus, (Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus)), Glycine max (Bradyrhizobium japonicum), Ornithopus and Lupinus formed DNA homology group II which was further divided into 4 DNA homology subgroups. Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus) {{were shown to}} be genetically distinct from B. japonicum. Plasmid profiles {{were determined}} for strains of R. loti and Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus). All R. loti strains contained a single large indigenous plasmid, whereas strains from Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus) carried multiple plasmids of molecular weights ranging from 130 - 280 MDal. A plasmid-cured derivative of R. loti NZP 2213 was isolated and found to still form effective nodules on Lotus tenuis, suggesting that nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes are not plasmid-borne in this strain. The functions of the indigenous plasmids carried in Lotus rhizobia are unknown. Symbiotic mutants of R. loti strain NZP 2037 were isolated by random Tn 5 -mutagenesis. Mutants included strains blocked in root hair curling (Hac), nodule initiation (Noi), bacterial release (Bar) and nitrogen fixation (Cof) on Lotus pedunculatus. The nodulation (nod) gene region from R. loti strain NZP 2037 was isolated from a pLAFR 1 -NZP 2037 gene library using the cloned Tn 5 containing EcoRI fragment from the Nod¯ mutant as a probe. Two cosmids were isolated and were found to complement the NZP 2037 Nod¯ mutant. Hybridisation and complementation experiments confirmed that a 7. 1 kb EcoRI fragment present in both nod cosmids carried gene sequences involved in nodulation. An EcoRI and Hind III restriction enzyme map of the nod gene region in R. loti NZP 2037 was constructed using nod cosmids pPN 305 and pPN 306. Using the cloned R. loti NZP 2037 nod gene region (7. 1 kb EcoRI fragment from pPN 305) as a <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probe,</b> highly conserved DNA sequences from other strains of R. loti and Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus) were identified. The nod gene region from Bradyrhizobium spp. (Lotus) strain NZP 2309 was isolated by direct 'in planta' complementation of the R. loti Nod¯ mutant using a NZP 2309 pLAFR 1 gene library. Comparative physical and genetical studies showed that the R. loti NZP 2037 nod gene region isolated shared functional similarities with previously isolated nod gene regions from R. trifolii and R. meliloti {{despite the fact that}} only weak DNA homology was observed between the corresponding regions. This suggested {{that at least some of}} the nod gene sequences carried on the cloned R. loti nod gene region belong to the highly conserved 'common' nod gene sequence category...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} for biogas {{production is}} reliant on the tightly coupled synergistic activities of complex microbial consortia. Members of the uncultured A 6 phylotype, within the phylum Chloroflexi, {{are among the}} most abundant genus-level-taxa of mesophilic anaerobic digester systems treating primary and surplus sludge from wastewater treatment plants, yet are known only by their 16 S rRNA gene sequence. This study applied metagenomics to obtain a complete circular genome (2. 57 Mbp) from a representative of the A 6 taxon. Preliminary annotation of the genome indicates these organisms to be anaerobic chemoorganoheterotrophs with a fermentative metabolism. Given their observed abundance, they are likely important primary fermenters in digester systems. Application of fluorescence in situ <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probes</b> designed in this study revealed their morphology to be short filaments present within the flocs. The A 6 were sometimes co-located with the filamentous Archaea Methanosaeta spp. suggesting potential undetermined synergistic relationships.

40|$|The {{gene pool}} of insectivorous sundew, Drosera rotundifolia L., was studied to {{identify}} and analyse sequences encoding for pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. The digested genomic DNA was in ¿inverted¿ Southern <b>hybridisation</b> <b>probed</b> to 19 clones for PR genes from different plant sources. From representatives of PR subgroups 1 ¿ 5, 8 and 9, genes for glucanases (PR- 2), chitinases (PR- 3) and thaumatin-like proteins (PR- 5) were hybridising. A PCR approach using degenerated primers was chosen to isolate sequences of sundew glucanase gene. Translation of a 500 bp long putative glucanase revealed similarity to catalytic domain of other glucanase amino acid sequences. Despite the peculiarity of this sequence, it contains all conserved amino acid residues important for catalysis. The sequence obtained in this study {{represents one of the}} first sequences encoding for nuclear genes in sundews reported, and brings the first evidence for presence of glucanases in sundew. The potential use of this sequence in biotechnology is considered as well...|$|R
