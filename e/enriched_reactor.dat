This shutdown was initiated by TVA supplying economical power to the diffusion plant complex. As a result of world wide over production of <b>enriched,</b> <b>reactor</b> grade U{sup 235 }, the K- 27 switch yard and switch house area was placed in standby in 1985. Subsequently, as the future production requirements decreased, the cost of production increased and the separation technologies for other processes improved, the facility was permanently shutdown in December, 1987. This Site Characterization Report {{is a part of}} the FY- 88 engineering Feasibility Study for placing ORGDP Gaseous Diffusion Process facilities in 'Permanent Shutdown'. It is sponsored by the Department of Energy through Virgil Lowery of Headquarters [...] Enrichment and through Don Cox of ORO [...] Enrichment Operations. The primary purpose of these building or site characterization reports is to document, quantify, and map the following potential problems: Asbestos; PCB containing fluids; Oils, coolants, and chemicals; and External contamination. With the documented quantification of the concerns (problems) the Engineering Feasibility Study will then proceed with examining the potential solutions. For this study, permanent shutdown is defined as the securing and/or conditioning of each facility to provide 20 years of safe service with minimal expenditures and, where feasible, also serving DOE's needs for long-term warehousing or other such low-risk use. The K- 700 power house series of buildings were either masonry construction or a mix of masonry and wood. The power generating equipment was removed and sold as salvage in the mid 1960 s but the buildings and auxiliary equipment were left intact. The nine ancillary buildings in the power house area use early in the Manhattan Project for special research projects, were left intact minus the original special equipment. During the late 1960 s and 1970 s, some of the abandoned buildings were used for offices, special projects, and storage. Some of the remaining electrical transformers contain PCBs in concentrations less than 500 ppm. Many of the steam and hot water pipes in the buildings are insulated with asbestos insulation, but none of the equipment or buildings have high counts of surface radioactive contamination. The general conditions of the buildings are from fair to poor. Many should be boarded-up to prevent personnel entry and in some cases demolitions would be the safer alternative...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{fuel cell}} (MFC) systems capable of both {{treating}} wastewaters and recovering energy {{have the potential}} for successful scale-up as a low carbon technology. These systems utilize microorganisms residing in biofilms as biocatalytic agents in the conversion of reduced substrates to electrical energy. As such, {{it is important to understand}} how MFC anodic biofilms develop over time and also how environmental parameters such as substrate type, temperature, carbon support material, anode architecture and optimized applied potentials also affect electrogenic performance. The type of substrate was found to have a large impact on the acclimation and performance of electrogenic biofilms. Acetate produced the highest power density of 7. 2 W m• 3 and butyrate the lowest at 0. 29 W m• 3, but it was also found that biofilm acclimation to these different trophic Conditions also determined the MFC response to different substrate types i. e. both acetate and butyrate substrates produced power densities of 1. 07 and 1. 0 W m• 3 respectively in a sucrose <b>enriched</b> <b>reactor.</b> The use of MFCs for wastewater treatment in temperate regions requires the development of reactor systems that are robust to seasonal fluctuations and are energy efficient. As such, system performance was examined at three different operating temperatures (10 °C, 20 °C and 35 °C). At each temperature a maximum steady-state voltage of 0. 49 V ± 0. 02 V was achieved after an operational period of 47 weeks, with the time to reach steady-state voltage being dependent on acclimation temperature. The highest COD removal rates of 2. 98 g COD L- 1 d• 1 were produced in the 35 °C reactor but coulombic efficiencies (CE) were found to be significantly higher at pyschrophilic temperatures. Acclimation at different operating temperatures was found to a have a significant effect on the dynamic selection of psychrophilic, psychrotolerant and mesophilic anode respiring bacteria (ARB) and also influence the development of biofilm biomass, methanogenesis and electrogenic activity. Although start-up times were inversely influenced by temperature the amount of biomass accumulation increased with higher operational temperatures and this had a direct impact on biocatalytic performance. The three dimensional structure and porosity of different carbon anode materials affected anodic performance by determining the levels of surface area available for biofilm growth and the capacity for mass transfer to occur. Novel helical electrode configurations were used to look at the effect of altering turbulent flows to increase mass transfer rates and carbon surface areas available for electrogenic growth. The spiral with the highest amount of carbon veil and the smallest gap produced the highest power production of 11. 63 Wm- 3, Comparative studies of a logic controlled and un-controlled external load impedance showed that control affected the biocatalyst development and hence MFC performance. The controlled MFC better optimized the electrogenic anodic biofilm for power production, indicating that improved power and substrate conversion can be achieved by ensuring sustainable current demand, applied microbial selection pressures and near-optimal impedance for power transference.

40|$|Anaerobic sludge bed {{reactor systems}} like the upflow {{anaerobic}} sludge blanket (UASB) and expended granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactors are currently the mostly applied high-rate reactor systems for anaerobic wastewater treatment. The success of both systems {{has changed the}} world conception of wastewater treatment with energy recovery being an intrinsic part of the treatment process, avoidance of excess sludge problems and extremely low space requirement. Nevertheless, while broadening the UASB reactor application to a diverse type of wastewaters, high salinity wastewaters were found to give an adverse effect to the granulation processes. Accumulation of Na + at high concentrations produced weaker and fluffy granules endangering {{the applicability of the}} mentioned sludge bed systems. In this thesis, research was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of destabilization of the granules at high Na + concentrations, while trying to improve the granules’ properties. Chapter 1 gives an overview of high salinity wastewaters, the application and the bottlenecks of anaerobic wastewater treatment (AnWT) technology under extreme conditions. Focus is given to the granulation process as a key factor in the operation of high rate anaerobic reactors. Indeed, it is a complex process that involves physicochemical as well as biological mechanisms. A short overview of the previous research on anaerobic wastewater treatment processes for high salinity wastewaters is discussed, followed by granulation theories and processes. Referring to the imbalance in the monovalent to divalent cation ratio, the Ca 2 + augmentation approach is discussed in this chapter as a tool to establish a favourable ratio for the required granulation process. The chapter also discusses the need for extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, depending on the types of substrates, as a major factor for a successful granulation process. Specifically for high Na + concentrations, also the importance of K + and more specifically the K + /Na + ratio is discussed as a control regulator to alleviate the negative effects of Na +. Finally, the review discusses microbiological aspects related to the anaerobic treatment of high salinity wastewaters such as the adaptation of sludge to high Na + concentrations and the presence of halophilic/halotolerent microorganisms and their application in anaerobic wastewater treatment. In Chapter 2, the effects of high Na + concentrations on methanogenic sludge bed reactor systems were investigated. In three different UASB reactors a rapid acclimation to 5 or 15 g Na + /L was observed, showing satisfactory results for a period of 100 days, when the reactors were fed with a mixture of acetate, gelatine and ethanol. Loading rates up to at least 18 kg COD/m 3. d gave a good COD removal performance and the cultivated sludge showed high specific methanogenic activities (SMA) on acetate, propionate, butyrate and H 2 compared to the inoculated granules. Remarkably, only the reactor which was operated at a lower COD (5 instead of 50 g/L) exhibited severe washout, probably due to the much shorter HRT that was applied, i. e. 12 hours compared to 120 hours. Interestingly, the SMA of the biomass that washed out from this reactor showed considerably higher SMAs than the washed-out biomass from the other reactors. The performance of the granular sludge systems in this study shows the appropriateness of anaerobic inocula, pre-grown under saline conditions for the anaerobic treatment of high salinity wastewater.   In Chapter 3 the production of EPS in UASB reactor systems that were operated under high salinity conditions was investigated. Four different UASB reactors were operated at loading rates up to 22 kg COD/m 3. d with different acetate:gelatine:starch ratios as the substrate. Reactors were fed with partially acidified and fully acidified substrates, i. e. PAS and FAS respectively, and Na + concentrations of either 10 or 20 g Na + /L. One of the reactors additionally received 1 g of Ca 2 + /L. All four reactors showed a good performance with COD removal efficiencies exceeding 90 %. Proteins were the dominant EPS and the PAS-fed granules gave much higher EPS concentrations than FAS-fed granules. However, the proteins concentration was found not dependent on the Na + concentration in the feed. Interestingly, the granules from the reactors which were operated at a Na + /Ca 2 + ratio of 770 contained more polysaccharides than granules from reactors operated at a high Na + /Ca 2 + ratio of 1540. SEM images showed that that PAS-fed granule had a smoother granule surfaces than FAS-fed granule. PAS-fed granules also were considerably larger than FAS-fed granules. When the influent contained additional Ca 2 +, clear cracks or fissures could be observed {{on the surface of the}} granules. Na + concentrations of 10 g/L seemed to increase the granule size, which may have been caused by swelling of the EPS matrix. Shear tests indicated that PAS-fed granules were stronger than the FAS fed granules and that Ca 2 + addition had a positive effect on granule strength. The calcium content of these granules also was higher with 150 mg/g TSS compared to 60 mg/g TSS in the other reactors. Batch tests at high Na + concentrations confirmed calcium leaching from the granules. When granular sludge was exposed to 20 g Na + /L in batches, leaching of Ca 2 + from granules took place with a maximum obtained after 10 days. The calcium content of the granules decreased from approximately 85 to 52 mg/g TSS. Therefore, the highest Na + concentrations resulted in the weakest granules. Chapter 4 describes the results of batch incubation studies in which anaerobic granular sludge was augmented with 0. 3 g Ca 2 + /L at Na + concentrations of 20 g/L. Experiments followed the previously described results of Chapter 3 showing that high Na + concentrations caused Ca 2 + leaching from anaerobic granules. Extensive SEM-EDX and SEM-BSE measurements confirm leaching of calcium from the granules when these are exposed to higher Na + concentrations. Moreover Ca 2 + additions seemed to indeed maintain the Ca 2 + content of granular sludge. Initial attachment of microorganism is very important for the development of granules and biofilms. Therefore, biofilm studies were conducted and explained in Chapter 5. Four different biofilm reactors with a non-woven carrier material were exposed to different Na + concentrations (10 or 20 g/L) and inoculated with crushed granules. Acetate was used as the substrate. One of the reactors received 0. 3 g Ca 2 + /L and another one 0. 7 g K + /L. The reactors were operated as sequencing batches. The reactor fed with K + gave the best performance. Lower salinity (10 compared to 20 g Na + /L) improved the performance and the reactor which received calcium gave the worst results. This finding contradicts with previous experiments in Chapter 3. However, the situation in the biofilm reactors is completely different because the biofilms had to form from scratch. FISH-CLSM images revealed no significant visible differences in microbial coverage (i. e. bacteria and archea) of the non-woven fabric, except for the calcium <b>enriched</b> <b>reactor.</b> After 40 days of operation, it was clearly observed that 20 g Na + /L does not prevent the initial microbial attachment under anaerobic conditions. From 16 sRNA DGGE measurements it was shown that the biofilms had a similar population and that this population did not change very much in time. The Archea were related to Methanosaeta harundinacae (acetoclastic), Methanolinea tarda and Methanobacterium subteraaneum (both hydrogenotrophic). Apparently these species can easily adapt to high salinity. However, the biofilms in the reactors did not show any of the known acetate-oxidizing bacteria that are expectedly needed for the production of H 2 from acetate as source for the growth of the found hydrogenotrophic Archea. Therefore, it is assumed that H 2 leakage by acetoclastic methanogen explain their presence in the reactor. Four identical UASB reactors treating concentrated wastewaters (10 – 30 g COD/L) were operated at 20 g Na + /L and in detail described in Chapter 6. PAS and FAS substrates were fed to different reactors to compare the effect of different organic substrates on granule activity, stability and growth. The effect of calcium augmentation on anaerobic granules’ properties was studied by feeding two of the reactors with additional calcium at a concentration of 0. 3 g Ca 2 + /L. A beneficial effect of potassium was demonstrated in Chapter 5 and it therefore was added to all the reactors, at a concentration of 0. 7 g K + /L. The treatment performance of the reactors was compared during a period of 120 days at increasing volumetric organic loading rates (OLRs). Physicochemical and microbiological properties of the anaerobic granules were determined and discussed. The results showed that high COD removal efficiencies are possible at 20 g Na + /L, up to an organic loading rate of at least 14 g COD/L. d. At a loading rate of 25 g COD/L. d the performance and stability of all reactors deteriorated. There were indications that calcium augmentation had a positive effect on biomass retention, but this could not be further quantified. The microbial assays gave similar results as in Chapter 5. Compared to the inoculum, bacterial diversity in FAS-fed granules did not change significantly but was changed considerably in PAS-fed granules. Complex organic PAS feed resulted in more complex bacterial populations that were not related to archea. The bacterial presence of a dominant phylotype, belonging to the family of Marinilabiliaceaeand specifically Alkaliflexus imshenetskiiwas evidenced. Members of Marinilabiliaceae are capable of degrading polymeric substances such as starch and gelatine. The dominant archeal species in the reactors was related to Methanosaeta harundinacea. Methanosaetahave been found to play a major role in granulation      In Chapter 7 the results of this research are discussed in a general context. Directions for further research are presented focussing on the increase in biomass activity and biomass retention in high salinity wastewaters by improving the adaptability of microbes and the anaerobic sludge granulation process...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} a study of {{various aspects of the}} relationship between heavy water and the development of the civilian and military uses of atomic energy. It begins with a historical sketch which traces the heavy water storyfrom its discovery by Harold Urey in 1932 through its coming of age from scientific curiosity to strategic nuclear material at the eve of World War II and finally into the post-war period, where the military and civilian strands have some- times seemed inextricably entangled. The report next assesses the nonproliferation implications of the use of heavy water- moderated power reactors; several different reactor types are discussed, but the focus in on the natural uranium, on- power fueled, pressure tube reactor developed in Canada, the CANDU. The need for and development of on-power fueling safe- guards is discussed in some detail. Also considered is the use of heavy water in plutonium production reactors as well as the broader issue of the relative nuclear leverage that suppliers can bring to bear on countries with natural ura- nium-fueled reactors as compared to those using enriched designs. The final chapter reviews heavy water production methods and analyzes the difficulties involved in implemen- ting these on both a large and a small scale. It concludes with an overview of proprietary and nonproliferation constraints on heavy water technology transfer. Our major conclusions are as follows: 1. On-power fueling of CANDU reactors leads to special, well recognized safeguarding problems. These have been addres- sed by a safeguards development program, encompassing both systems analysis and hardware development, jointly sponsored by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. (AECL), the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The approach involves surveillance, containment, and item-counting of irradiated fuel bundles. Although the complete system has not as yet been tested on an operating reactor, {{it appears to be a}} good example of "proliferation resistance engineering. " The major problem may be the political one of obtaining agreement to incorporate the system in operating reactors and those under construction. 2. The question of relative leverage on natural uranium vs. enriched uranium fuel cycles does not have a neat answer. At the moment, most of the countries of proliferation concern have neither large amounts of uranium ore nor the ability to enrich it. (There are, of course, some significant excep- tions, the most obvious being South Africa which has both.) In the near term, the chances of achieving a consensus among current suppliers of separative work, all of whom belong to the London Club, not to supply it in the event of violations of nonproliferation agreements, also seems greater than the prospects of reaching a similar agreement among all countries who might be able to supply uranium ore. If we assume in ad- dition that the malefactor also can produce heavy water [...] no small matter [...] the potential leverage advantage would seem to lie with <b>enriched</b> <b>reactors.</b> On the other hand, the spread of enrichment technology [...] which is easier to rationalize on civil- ian grounds if <b>enriched</b> <b>reactors</b> are in place [...] could tip the scales the other way. In general, however, this weighing of enriched vs. natural uranium fuel cycles is unnecessarily restrictive. Experience has shown that there are many poten- tial levers [...] nuclear and non-nuclear [...] which can be used to persuade countries to adhere to nonproliferation norms. The heart of the matter is the political will to use these in the face of conflicting policy objectives. 3. Unlike uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion and the gas centrifuge, key aspects of which are closely held on nonproliferation grounds, techniques for heavy water produc- tion, particularly by hydrogen sulfide-water exchange (the GS process), have been extensively documented in the open liter- ature. Nevertheless, construction and operation of large plants are difficult, and thus there is good reason to believe that the technology will not spread rapidly through the indig- enous efforts of developing countries. Unlike uranium enrich- ment and fuel reprocessing, heavy water production does not provide a direct route from civilian fuel cycle to weapons- usable materials; on these grounds a logical quid pro quo forits transfer would be adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or acceptance of the principle of full-scope safeguards by the recipient...|$|R

5000|$|CAP {{has yet to}} be cultured, but {{the ability}} to enrich lab-scale EBPR {{communities}} with up to 80% CAP [...] has enabled research into its metabolism using meta-omic approaches. [...] EBPR is generally associated with three stages: anaerobic, aerobic, and settling. For CAP to dominate in EBPR reactors, they must be able to thrive under these conditions. During the anaerobic phase, CAP can take up volatile fatty acids and store these simple carbon sources intracellularly as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). At the same time, intracellular polyphosphate is degraded to form ATP, releasing phosphate into the medium. During the subsequent aerobic phase, PHAs are used for energy production and phosphate is taken up from the medium to form polyphosphate. [...] Genomic reconstruction from an EBPR <b>reactor</b> <b>enriched</b> with CAP IIA revealed it to contain two different types of phosphate transporters, the high-affinity Pst and low-affinity Pit transporters, as well as using the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) glycogen degradation pathway. [...] Furthermore, the CAP IIA genome contains nitrogen and CO2 fixation genes, which indicate CAP has adapted to environments limited in carbon and nitrogen. One interesting discrepancy between the genomic data and reactor performance data was the lack of a functional respiratory nitrate reductase gene. Previous work had shown CAP could use nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor, but the genomic data indicate the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene could not function in the electron transport chain, as it lacked the necessary quinol reductase subunit. To resolve these issues, lab-scale EBPR <b>reactors</b> <b>enriched</b> with CAP IA and CAP IIA were tested for their nitrate-reduction capabilities.

25|$|To address {{concerns}} that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran {{has offered to}} place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all <b>enriched</b> uranium into <b>reactor</b> fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States has insisted that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{construction}} of a cosmid library from the biomass produced in an <b>enriched</b> Sequencing Fed-Batch <b>Reactor</b> allowed the isolation of a new lipase by functional screening. The open reading frame of 928 bp encoded a polypeptide of 308 amino acids with a molecular mass of 32. 6 kDa. The amino acid sequence analysis revealed {{the presence of the}} conserved pentapeptide GXSXG essential for lipase activity. Alignment with known sequences of proteins showed no more than 52 % identity with different lipases, confirming the discovery of a novel gene sequence. The lipase was cloned and expressed in Streptomyces lividans and further purified by a combination of hydrophobic interaction and size-exclusion chromatography. Spectrophotometric assays with different p-nitrophenyl esters demonstrated a preference for long-length acyl chains, especially p-nitrophenylmyristate (C 14). Moreover, the enzyme presented an optimal activity at 60 degrees C and at alkaline pH of 10. 5...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} and metabolic activity of 2 ̆ 7 Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis 2 ̆ 7 {{was investigated in}} granular sludge from an anaerobic-aerobic sequencing batch <b>reactor</b> <b>enriched</b> for glycogen-accumulating organisms. In this process, the electron donor (acetate) and the electron acceptor (oxygen) were supplied sequentially in each phase. The organism, identified by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, was present throughout the granules; however, metabolic activity was limited to a 100 -mum-thick layer immediately {{below the surface of}} the granules. To investigate the cause of this, oxygen microsensors and a novel microscale biosensor for volatile fatty acids were used in conjunction with chemical staining for intracellular storage polymers. It was found that the limited distribution of activity was caused by mass transport limitation of oxygen into the granules during the aerobic phase.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the Laser Isotope Separation (LIS) methodology is given together with illustrations showing a simplified version of the LIS technique, {{an example of the}} two-photon photoionization category, and a diagram depicting how the energy levels of various isotope influence the LIS process. Applications were proposed for the LIS system which, in addition to enriching uranium, could in themselves develop into programs of tremendous scope and breadth. These include the treatment of radioactive wastes from light-water nuclear <b>reactors,</b> <b>enriching</b> the deuterium isotope to make heavy-water, and enriching the light isotopes of such elements as titanium for aerospace weight-reducing programs. Economic comparisons of the LIS methodology with the current method of gaseous diffusion indicate an overwhelming advantage; the laser process promises to be 1000 times more efficient. The technique could also be utilized in chemical reactions with the tuned laser serving as a universal catalyst to determine the speed and direction of a chemical reaction...|$|R
40|$|Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 {{was very}} {{successful}} in terms of Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) project completions. This photobriefing book highlights these projects and activities in one ongoing project. Brief descriptions of projects planned for the future are also provided. Two D&D projects funded by the US DOE Office of Environmental Management (EM- 40) were completed safely and on schedule in FY 1998 : (1) Argonne Thermal Source Reactor (ATSR) was a low-power research reactor that operated from 1950 to 1989; and (2) The Building 594 (a. k. a. 579) Waste Ion-Exchange Facility was an obsolete facility constructed in the 1950 s to process waste fluids from a collecting lagoon. Field work at one project was ongoing during FY 1998 : (1) Chicago Pile 5 (CP- 5) was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, <b>enriched</b> uranium-fueled <b>reactor</b> used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 - 79. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979. D&D {{is scheduled to be}} completed in FY 2000. Project experience has lent itself to developing unique staff capabilities. The D&D group was chosen as lead organization for a project supported with operating funds provided by Argonne's Plant Facilities and Services (PFS) Division. This project was also completed safely and on schedule in FY 1998 : (1) The Building 200 / 205 Pneumatic Transfer Tube was constructed in the late 1960 s between Hot Cell M- 4 in Building 200 and a glove box in Room F- 131, Building 205, and used to transfer irradiated fuel specimens and other samples between the two buildings...|$|R

CP- 5 was a 5 -megawatt, heavy water-moderated, <b>enriched</b> uranium-fueled <b>reactor</b> used to produce neutrons for scientific research from 1954 [...] 79. The reactor was shut down and defueled in 1979, and placed into a lay-up condition pending funding for decontamination and decommissioning (D and D). In 1990, work was initiated on the D and D of the facility in order to alleviate safety and environmental concerns associated with the site due to {{the deterioration of the}} building and its associated support systems. A decision was made in early Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 to direct focus and resources to the completion of the CP- 5 Reactor D and D Project. An award of contract was made in December 1998 to Duke Engineering and Services (Marlborough, MA), and a D and D crew was on site in March 1999 to begin work, The project is scheduled to be completed in July 2000. The Laboratory has determined that the building housing the CP- 5 facility is surplus to the Laboratory's needs and will be a candidate for demolition.

40|$|Thiopaq {{biotechnology}} for partial sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur is {{an efficient}} way to remove H 2 S from biogases. However, its application for high-pressure natural gas desulfurization needs upgrading. Particularly, an increase in alkalinity of the scrubbing liquid is required. Therefore, the feasibility of sulfide oxidation into elemental sulfur under oxygen limitation was tested at extremely haloalkaline conditions in lab-scale bioreactors using mix sediments from hypersaline soda lakes as inoculum. The microbiological analysis, both culture dependent and independent, of the successfully operating bioreactors revealed a domination of obligately chemolithoautotrophic and extremely haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Two subgroups were recognized among the isolates. The subgroup <b>enriched</b> from the <b>reactors</b> operating at pH 10 clustered with Thioalkalivibrio jannaschii¿Thioalkalivibrio versutus core group of the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Another subgroup, obtained mostly with sulfide as substrate and at lower pH, belonged to the cluster of facultatively alkaliphilic Thioalkalivibrio halophilus. Overall, the results clearly indicate a large potential of the genus Thiolalkalivibrio to efficiently oxidize sulfide at extremely haloalkaline conditions, which makes it suitable for application in the natural gas desulfurization...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} resolution of the long-term waste disposition issue based on complete destruction of fissile material and all higher actinides. It begins with {{a brief history of}} geologic storage leading to the present impasse in the US. The proliferation aspects of commercial plutonium are presented in a new light as a further driver for complete destruction. The special problems in Russia and the US of the disposition of the highly <b>enriched</b> spent naval <b>reactor</b> fuel and spent research reactor fuel are also presented. The scale of the system required for complete destruction is also examined and it is shown that a practical system for complete destruction of commercial and defense fissile material must be widely dispersed rather than concentrated at a single site. Central tenants of the US National Academy of Sciences recommendations on waste disposition are examined critically and several technologies considered for waste destruction are described briefly and compared Recommendations for waste disposition based on Accelerator-Driven Transmutation Technology suitable for both the US and Russia are presented...|$|R
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or <b>enrich</b> uranium for <b>reactor</b> fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|R
40|$|A {{granular}} airlift <b>reactor</b> <b>enriched</b> in ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was operated at 10 °C performing stable partial nitritation in the long-term. The reactor treated {{a synthetic}} low-strength influent during 250 days {{with an average}} nitrogen loading rate of 0. 63 ± 0. 06 g N L⁻¹ d⁻¹. Nitrate production was barely detected, being the average concentration in the effluent of 0. 6 ± 0. 3 mg N-NO 3 L⁻¹. Furthermore, a suitable effluent for a subsequent reactor performing the anammox process was achieved. A maximum specific growth rate as high as 0. 63 ± 0. 05 d⁻¹ was determined by performing kinetic experiments with the granular sludge in a chemostat and fitting the results to the Monod model. Pyrosequencing analysis showed a high enrichment in AOB (41 and 65 % of the population were identified as Nitrosomonas genus on day 98 and 233, respectively) and an effective repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the long-term. Pyrosequencing analysis also identified the coexistence of nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic psychrotolerant microorganisms in the granular sludge. Some psychrotolerant microorganisms are producers of cryoprotective extracellular polymeric substances that could explain the better survival of the whole consortia at cold temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Biofilms are {{ubiquitous}} in nature, forming diverse adherent microbial communities that perform {{a plethora of}} functions. Here we operated two laboratory-scale sequencing batch <b>reactors</b> <b>enriched</b> with Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis (Accumulibacter) performing {{enhanced biological phosphorus removal}} (EBPR). Reactors formed two distinct biofilms, one floccular biofilm, consisting of small, loose, microbial aggregates, and one granular biofilm, forming larger, dense, spherical aggregates. Using metagenomic and metaproteomic methods we investigated the proteomic differences between these two biofilm communities, identifying a total of 2, 022 unique proteins. To understand biofilm differences, we compared protein abundances that were statistically enriched in both biofilm states. Floccular biofilms were enriched with pathogenic secretion systems suggesting a highly competitive microbial community. Comparatively, granular biofilms revealed a high stress environment with evidence of nutrient starvation, phage predation pressure, and increased extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and cell lysis. Granular biofilms were enriched in outer membrane transport proteins to scavenge the extracellular milieu for amino acids and other metabolites, likely released through cell lysis, to supplement metabolic pathways. This study provides the first detailed proteomic comparison between Accumulibacter-enriched floccular and granular biofilm communities, proposes a conceptual model for the granule biofilm, and offers novel insights into granule biofilm formation and stability...|$|R
