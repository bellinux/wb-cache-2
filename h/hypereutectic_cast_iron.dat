40|$|Purpose: Thixoability of the ASTM A 536 {{nodular cast}} iron is analyzed, it meaning its ability to hold a {{thixotropic}} semi-solid state and to be formed as such. Thixoability can be characterized by the solidification range, fraction of primary phase and sensitiveness of liquid fraction with temperature (dfl/dT) within the solidification range. It is also investigated the effect of thixocasting in the microstructure of the considered alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and thermodynamic calculation package THERMOCALC were used to predict transformations temperatures involving liquid formation and dfl/dT within the solidification range. Microstructures of thixotropic slurries produced by partial melting were observed. Findings: Thixoforming of ASTM A 536 nodular iron can be considered in a narrow window of about 28 °C, were some dissolution of graphite nodules can still be afforded; this window meaning the range of temperatures of co-existence of austenite + graphite + liquid were the eutectic transformation is taking place. At higher temperatures the dissolution of graphite nodules in liquid can be significant. Research limitations/implications: Thixoability prediction models rely on sensitive experiments as thermoanalysis, with results strongly dependent on experimental conditions; and on thermodynamic data, sometimes not available or reliable for a specific alloy composition. Practical implications: The prediction of the thixoability of a certain alloy can make it more effective its thixoprocessing, allows better control of processing parameters and quality of final product; can also subsidize modifications in the alloy {{to make it more}} suitable to semi-solid processing.

40|$|The carbon {{equivalent}} of this alloy (4. 37 wt%) {{is greater than}} the eutectic composition (4. 3 wt% C) so this alloy is known as a <b>hypereutectic</b> grey <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Si has a very low solubility in cementite and therefore its presence favours the formation of graphite in preference to cementite. Therefore, upon cooling from the liquid, the primary phase to solidify is free graphite. Graphite forms directly from the melt as flakes (black) rather than dendrites. These flakes are interconnected and align themselves in the heat flow direction. Upon further cooling the remaining liquid forms initially as a eutectic mixture of austenite and cementite, known as ledeburite. The austenite within the eutectic further transforms to a mixture of pearlite and cementite. The graphite is eventually embedded in a complex mixture known as 'transformed ledeburite'. The graphite flakes are very soft and have low density so compensate for freezing contraction upon solidification, however they also act effectively as cracks making the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is brittle. ...|$|R

Since in this process non-uniform cooling rates are produced, the mechanical properties are expected to spatially vary due {{to the development of}} different microstructures along the thimble. The twin aims of this work were to (1) experimentally validate the GWT prediction capabilities of the microstructural model proposed earlier by the authors in the rodding process of a hypereutectic GCI-STC, and (2) estimate, from the numerically obtained microstructure and ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the local hardness of the alloy after the numerical predictions of the microstructure were experimentally validated. To this end, the final microstructure at different points of the thimble and the hardness profile along its radial direction were measured for validation purposes. Moreover, this rodding process was simulated using an extension of a thermal microstructural model previously developed by the authors and the GWT was superimposed on that simulation. The computed results encompass cooling curves, the evolution of gray and white fractions, eutectic radii and densities and, in addition, the hardness profile.
