5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by <b>John</b> <b>Roberts,</b> now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|Like Sherman Minton, Clarence Thomas {{was not a}} Catholic at {{the time}} he was {{appointed}} to the Court. Thomas was raised Catholic and briefly attended Conception Seminary College, a Roman Catholic seminary, but had joined the Protestant denomination of his wife after their marriage. At some point in the late 1990s, Thomas returned to Catholicism. In 2005, <b>John</b> <b>Roberts</b> became the third Catholic Chief Justice and the fourth Catholic on the Court. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Alito became the fifth on the Court, and the eleventh in the history of the Court. Alito's appointment gave the Court a Catholic majority for the first time in its history. Besides Thomas, at least one other Justice, James F. Byrnes, was raised as a Roman Catholic, but converted to a different branch of Christianity prior to serving on the Court.|$|E

5|$|The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was {{a former}} captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was {{appointed}} by the African Committee of the Royal African Company, as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with <b>John</b> <b>Roberts,</b> governor of the Castle, Stubbs was {{forced out of the}} governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC, accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.|$|E

Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert, but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina's disappointment. They hitch a ride with Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) and his older cousin Leslie (Jack McBrayer), who are going to the concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs. Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony, which drives them to push Gene to win.|$|E
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar <b>John</b> <b>Roberts</b> in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E
