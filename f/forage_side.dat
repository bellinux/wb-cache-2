40|$|The film, 2001, {{provides}} {{a useful tool for}} thinking about the relationship between intelligence and technology. The opening scenes depict a pre-historic time when a troop of ape-like creatures inhabit an environment that is similar to contemporary images of the African savanna. The ape-like creatures <b>forage</b> <b>side</b> by side with pig-like animals in peaceful harmony, and both the apes and the pigs are prey to large members of the feline persuasion. The apes quarrel {{with each other and with}} other bands about access to a watering hole during which they jump up and down, making threatening sounds and gestures, but never directly kill their competitors. At night they huddle together beneath rock ledges, listening fearfully to the noises of dangerous predators. One morning they awake to find a giant, black, steel rectangle lodged before them. It is clearly not a part of the natural world they have inhabited to that time. As the sun rises over this gigantic object (not unlike a huge domino made entirely of black Teflon of the kind you see at the bottom of a modern frying pan) one of the apes picks up the leg bone of an animal that has been killed in som...|$|E
5000|$|Emerald shiners {{are used}} for fishing bait, {{especially}} for winter fishing because of the shiner's hardiness in cold weather. They are also an important resource for other animals to <b>forage.</b> The glistening <b>sides</b> of the shiner, along with graceful movements make it good for an aquarium fish.|$|R
50|$|Back Badge - {{the badge}} worn {{on the back}} of headdress reads Egypt. This was awarded as an honour to the 28th Foot and {{subsequently}} worn by the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry. It is worn on the <b>forage</b> cap and <b>side</b> hat; and on the shako of the regimental band and bugles.|$|R
50|$|The bulk-supply {{problems}} were alleviated somewhat by {{the practice of}} foraging, which, in the proper season, supplied much of the food for animals and men on both <b>sides.</b> <b>Foraging</b> was practiced with and without command sanction, wherever an army went, and it became command policy during Ulysses S. Grant’s Vicksburg campaign and William T. Sherman’s Atlanta campaign. Foraging was less prevalent in the east, especially by 1864, {{for the simple reason}} that northeastern Virginia had already been picked clean by three years of war.|$|R
50|$|These birds mainly eat insects, {{especially}} carpenter ants and wood-boring beetle larvae. They also eat fruits, nuts, and berries, including {{poison ivy}} berries. Pileated woodpeckers often chip out large and roughly rectangular holes in trees while searching out insects, especially ant galleries. They also lap up ants by reaching with their long tongues into crevices. They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees, but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage {{on or near}} the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a variety of insect life. They may <b>forage</b> around the <b>sides</b> of human homes or even cars, and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.|$|R
40|$|Multi-robot {{foraging}} {{has been}} widely studied in the literature, and the general assumption is that the robots are simple, i. e., with limited processing and carrying capacity. We previously studied continuous foraging with slightly more capable robots, and in this article, {{we are interested in}} using similar robots for item delivery. Interestingly, item delivery and <b>foraging</b> are two <b>sides</b> of the same coin: foraging an item from a location is similar to satisfying a demand. We formally define the multi-robot item delivery problem and show that the continuous foraging problem is a special case of it. We contribute distributed multi-robot algorithms that solve the item delivery and foraging problems and describe how our shared world model is synchronized across the multi-robot team. We performed extensive experiments on simulated robots using a Java simulator, and we present our results to demonstrate that we outperform benchmark algorithms from multi-robot foraging...|$|R
50|$|Initially dressed {{mainly in}} dark blue/crimson full-dress uniforms and heavy leather shakos covered in black cloth with large brass badge, the French soon found such a uniform {{impractical}} in the testing climate of Algeria. Soon, {{they were wearing}} their simpler, secondary uniforms with Napoleonic-style soft cap known as bonnet de police. This {{was a form of}} <b>forage</b> or large <b>side</b> cap comprising a long, tapered cloth bag with tassel at the point, having a large turn-up {{at the base of the}} cap. The turn-up was called a turban, whilst the tapered bag was called a flamme. The long flamme could be worn hanging down the side of the wearer's head and over the shoulder, or else it could be doubled up and tucked into the turban, with just the tassel hanging down through a notch in the front of the turban. For infantry, the flamme was garance (crimson) colour, whilst the turban was dark blue. Narrow lines of dark blue piping (passepoil) ran up four sides of the flamme to the point. A cloth badge, such as a bursting grenade, was often worn on the front of the turban.|$|R
40|$|The legumes are {{favorite}} {{species in}} green manure and, {{depending on the}} management, they can promote good soil coverage between the rows on the coffee plantation and reduce the weed infestation. This study evaluated soil coverage and weed infestation on the producing coffee management with forage peanut and perennial soybean. The experiment was done in Patrocínio, MG, in a 11 years old producing coffee orchard, cultivar Catuaí Vermelho IAC- 99, spaced by 3. 80 x 0. 70 m. Nine treatments were evaluated as a 23 + 1 factorial, in randomized blocks, with 4 repetitions, with two perennial legumes: forage peanut (Arachis pintoi) and perennial soybean (Glycine wightii); two types of side management: without side management, or with side management with glyphosate at 50 cm from canopy projection; two types of vertical management: without vertical management, or with legume vertical management at 5 cm above soil level. The additional treatment {{was done with the}} herbicide glyphosate (1. 0 kg ha- 1 of acid equivalent) between the rows. Intercropping forage peanut and perennial soybean in all management provided good soil cover, reducing the weed infestation. The <b>forage</b> peanut with <b>side</b> and vertical management and perennial soybean presented smaller weed infestation. There was a negative and significant correlation among legume soil cover and weed infestation. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the nematode C. elegans has proven increasingly useful for the genetic dissection of neurobiological signaling pathways and for investigating the neural and molecular basis of nervous system function. Locomotion {{is among the most}} complex aspects of C. elegans behavior, and involves a number of discrete motor activities such as omega bends (deep bends typically on the ventral side of the body which reorient the direction of forward locomotion), reversals (changes {{in the direction of the}} locomotion wave that cause a switch from forward to backward crawling), and <b>foraging</b> (a rapid, <b>side</b> -to-side movement of the nose). Here we use automated methods to automatically detect these activities, which rely in part on a new method for obtaining a morphological skeleton describing the body posture of coiled worms. These new methods have made it possible to reliably detect events that are time-consuming and laborious to detect by real-time observation or human video analysis. We also present an algorithm for tracking and distinguishing multiple C. elegans in a video sequence, including when they are in physical contact with one another. Our method makes it possible to identify two worms correctly before and after they touch each other, and to find the body poses for further feature extraction. The algorithm has many applications in the study of physical interactions between C. elegan...|$|R
60|$|No {{sooner had}} the sheik decided {{to carry out}} Edgar's plan than he rapidly issued his orders. In five minutes {{the whole of the}} {{inhabitants}} of the douar were at work, the boys going out to fetch the camels, the men cutting down the long grass near the well and laying it in great bundles very tightly pressed together, the women cooking a large supply of flat cakes for the party. In two hours the preparations were completed and the twenty men moved off from the oasis. They travelled until ten o'clock in the evening. By the light of the moon, which was four days short of full, the sheik and Edgar selected a point for the erection of the zareba. It was a patch of rock cropping up from the summit of a sand-hill that fell away from it on all sides, and was just about the size required for the zareba. The camels were unloaded and the bundles of <b>forage</b> laid down <b>side</b> by side and formed into a square, the wall being some four feet thick and two feet high. The whole party, including the boys who were to take back the camels, then set to work to cut thorny bushes. These were piled thickly {{at the foot of the}} rock all round, being kept in their places by stakes driven into the sand and by ropes interlacing them. The work was only completed just as daylight broke.|$|R
60|$|Daws {{are more}} {{abundant}} {{in the west and}} south-west of England generally than in any other part of the kingdom; and they abound most in Somerset, or so it has seemed to me. It is true that the largest congregations of daws in the entire country are to be seen at Savernake in Wiltshire, where the ancient hollow beeches and oaks in the central parts of the forest supply them with all the nesting holes they require. There is no such wood of old decaying trees in Somerset to attract them to one spot in such numbers, but the country generally is singularly favourable to them. It is mainly a pastoral country with large areas of rich, low grass land, and ranges of high hills, where there are many rocky precipices such as the daw loves. For very good reasons he prefers the inland to the sea-cliff as a breeding site. It is, to begin with, {{in the midst of his}} feeding ground, whereas the sea-wall is a boundary to a feeding ground beyond which the bird cannot go. Better still, the inland bird has an immense advantage over the other in travelling to and from his nest in bad weather. When the wind blows strong from the sea the seaside bird must perpetually fight against it and win his home by sheer muscular exertion. The other bird, able to go <b>foraging</b> to this <b>side</b> or that, according to the way the wind blows, can always have the wind as a help instead of a hindrance.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{examination}} of osteoarthritis (OA) focuses on better understanding behavioral variability among themiddle Holocene foragers of the Cis-Baikal, Siberia, particularly {{as it pertains}} to a unique period ofdiachronic cultural change in the region. The three cemetery populations considered lie on either side ofan 800 e 1000 year biocultural ‘hiatus’dcharacterized by a cessation in the use of formal cemeteriesdandare located in two of the Cis-Baikal's four main micro-regions. Two of the cemetery samples, Lokomotivand Shamanka II, represent the pre-hiatus early Neolithic (EN) Kitoi culture (8000 e 7000 / 6800 cal. BP),while the third, Ust'-Ida I, represents the post-hiatus late Neolithiceearly Bronze Age (LNeEBA) IsakovoeSerovoeGlazkovo (or ISG) cultural complex (6000 / 5800 e 4000 cal. BP). Results reveal a dynamicpattern of variability across both time and space. Of particular interest is an apparent dichotomy betweenthe two pre-hiatus EN sites, namely considerably higher OA severity at Lokomotiv compared to ShamankaII. This disparity suggests fundamental behavioral differences between the populations despitetheir contemporaneity and cultural continuity, possibly reflecting distinct residential mobility patternsand population densities in their respective micro-regions. In addition, intra-site analyses reveal thatactivity may have differed considerably between the sexes, whether in type, intensity, and/or duration. Male-dominated logistical <b>foraging</b> on both <b>sides</b> of the hiatus may explain, at least in part, these discrepancies. Finally, results of intra-joint component analyses of the elbow and knee were similar acrossage, sex, and cemetery groups, and largely consistent with those of epidemiological studies. Takentogether, these results add to our growing understanding of pre- and post-hiatus adaptive strategies inthe Cis-Baikal by providing a more detailed picture of the complex and highly variable behavioral andactivity patterns employed by the region's middle Holocene foragers...|$|R
