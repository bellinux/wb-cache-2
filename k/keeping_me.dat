500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. Go and see him ... and tell {{everybody}} that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, {{but one of the}} most beautiful things in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky." [...] To other friends he wrote [...] "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A theatrical masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, {{shooting}} {{was to take}} place at a bridge overlooking the Detroit River, which was frozen at the time. The script, however, called for clear and running water, meaning that the crew had to brave dangerously low temperatures and conditions to clear the ice; finally they blew up the ice with dynamite. At another time, the crew spent a week filming on a Detroit street after dark, directly under a nursing home, with huge wind machines blowing for long hours. One evening a glass bottle with a note in it crashed to the ground from an upper floor. The note inside read, [...] "The noise is <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> awake all night long and I am getting sick. I am dying because of you." [...] John Cameron, second assistant director on the film, would later remark, [...] "I see Crimewave as a real turning point in a certain way, because if you survived that experience, nothing in the business could ever be as hard again." [...] Raimi cited the experience {{as one of the}} least favorite moments of his career.|$|E

500|$|The song {{opens with}} Fantasia's testimony: [...] "Listen, I done {{made it through}} the storm and the rain / So much heartache, pressure, so much pain / I been broken in two pieces, maybe more / And some nights I made my bed right on the floor." [...] The lyrics contain direct {{references}} to Christianity, with Fantasia singing: [...] "Thank you for never leaving me Lord Jesus!". She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. I made it. I {{made it through the}} storm." [...] She describes having a close relationship and faith in religion by singing: [...] "I got to say thank you Lord for <b>keeping</b> <b>me,</b> for grace and mercy. I thank you, because I made it!" [...] According to Devin Lazerine of Rap-Up, Fantasia [...] "triumphantly" [...] expresses the song's message through her vocals on lyrics such as [...] "I made it I made it, y’all! Still standing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin interviewed Schmidt. Impressed by him,s [...] from September 29, 2003: [...] "One of {{the first}} orders of {{business}} was joining his new 20-something colleagues at Burning Man, a free-form festival of artistic self-expression held in a Nevada desert lake bed. Sitting in his office shortly after his return, tanned and slightly weary, Eric Schmidt couldn't have been happier. [...] "They're <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> young," [...] he declared." [...] they recruited Schmidt to run their company in 2001 {{under the guidance of}} venture capitalists John Doerr and Michael Moritz.|$|E

His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> awake all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number.

Keep me on track. A lifetime later, he's still spying on me. Forget <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> on track. He's now trying to derail me. The man has just gleefully sent me a tub of e-mails, each of which deposits bodily fluid upon my person. I mean, thank God he's my friend. Imagine if he didn't like me." ...|$|E

In his letter, asking for forgiveness, he {{described himself as}} a [...] "prodigal son" [...] longing to return to the [...] "parental doors of the government". He wrote that his release from the jail will recast the faith of many Indians in the British rule. Also he said [...] "Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my future conduct would be. By <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos was incarcerated at the Florida Department of Corrections Broward Correctional Institution (BCI) {{death row}} for women, then {{transferred}} to the Florida State Prison for execution. Her appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied in 1996. In a 2001 petition to the Florida Supreme Court, she stated her intention to dismiss her legal counsel and terminate all pending appeals. [...] "I killed those men," [...] she wrote, [...] "robbed them as cold as ice. And I'd do it again, too. There's no chance in <b>keeping</b> <b>me</b> alive or anything, because I'd kill again. I have hate crawling through my system...I am so sick of hearing this 'she's crazy' stuff. I've been evaluated so many times. I'm competent, sane, and I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again." [...] While her attorneys argued {{that she was not}} mentally competent to make such a request, Wuornos insisted that she knew what she was doing, and a court-appointed panel of psychiatrists agreed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she resumed, [...] "I {{have read}} {{the report of the}} inquest.
