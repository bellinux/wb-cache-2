The pair worked on Manos Arriba for roughly two years and recorded it in Chan's recording studio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> of his home in Echo Park, Los Angeles.

Chana later said that the decision allowed her to have more creative input on her music and image. They completed eighteen tracks and chose five for the EP.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{particulate}} matter (PM) inside urban areas. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential to reduce outdoor PM concentrations by local removal inside semi-enclosed parking <b>garages.</b> <b>The</b> assessment is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the 3 D steady RANS equations and an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. First, an extensive CFD validation study is performed with gas dispersion wind-tunnel measurements. Next, the case study for Eindhoven city center is conducted on a high-resolution grid including 16 semi-enclosed garages. Traffic intensities on <b>the</b> streets and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> are converted to PM 10 source terms. <b>The</b> <b>garages</b> are ventilated with outdoor air. Simulations are performed with and without removal units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garages.</b> <b>The</b> case study is not intended to reproduce a particular pollution episode but to provide a preliminary indication of <b>the</b> potential reduction <b>in</b> PM 10 for representative meteorological and traffic conditions. The results show that 594 removal units allow reductions in local outdoor PM 10 by up to 50 % close to <b>the</b> <b>garages</b> while reductions up to 10 % are achieved further downstream. It is concluded that local removal in semi-enclosed parking garages can be an effective strategy towards improved outdoor air quality...|$|R

5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton once more {{finished}} fastest, {{but this time}} it was Sebastian Vettel in second, 0.264s behind Hamilton's time of 1m24.544s. The session started on a slightly wet track caused by rain over the night, but it soon dried up. Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit. His teammate Daniil Kvyat did not have a productive session either as he spent most of the time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage,</b> setting only seventeenth best time.|$|E

Donnie threatens to shoot Vic, who confesses that Angie is parked nearby, before walking into Angie's van and threatening to destroy her career if she continues to stalk his family, taking a picture of her with Vic as blackmail.

Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
