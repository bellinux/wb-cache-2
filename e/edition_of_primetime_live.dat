2500|$|In October 1984 {{television}} critic Rick Sherwood {{wrote that}} although the sexual tension between Sam and Diane provided a focus for Cheers other characters, their later romance and [...] "the removal of the love-hate subplot [...] much of {{the edge of the}} series [...] lost". In October 1985, Sherwood's interest in the show lessened because of the romance; Diane's affair with Frasier Crane [...] "made things worse". According to Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times in 1986, Glenn Caron (executive producer of Moonlighting) said: [...] "... I think it's masochistic to take two people who seem destined for each other and ask an audience not to see them get together". In 1989, Michael Hill of The Baltimore Evening Sun found the similarity between the Cheers characters and real-life news anchors Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer <b>of</b> <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> [...] "remarkable".|$|R

5000|$|Steve Lumbley, {{who worked}} for Tilton's {{ministry}} in 1991 when the original <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> investigation took place, told {{a reporter for the}} Dallas Observer in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece <b>of</b> the 1991 <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the dallasobserver.com blog [...] "Unfair Park", Lumbley asserted that [...] "the mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren't godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice." [...] However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton's unethical fundraising tactics, noting that [...] "God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down." ...|$|R

50|$|The initial ABC News <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> {{broadcast}} revealed Porter had abused over 100 {{children in}} Massachusetts. Sawyer interviewed 30 adults {{who had been}} raped as elementary school children by Porter. The investigation revealed that instead of removing Porter after parents reported the abuse, the Catholic Church had moved him to a treatment center and then to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he continued to rape dozens <b>of</b> children. <b>Primetime</b> <b>Live</b> interviewed 30 <b>of</b> Porter's victims and their parents, and confronted the priest who had knowingly transferred Porter from Massachusetts to Minnesota. They also contacted Porter himself, who still had contact with children as a Sunday school teacher at his church. The ABC News investigation discovered and interviewed a local babysitter who said she had also been sexually abused by Porter in 1984. After the report aired, {{it was discovered that}} Porter had also molested the babysitter's younger sister, a crime that was within the statute of limitations. This development allowed local Minnesota authorities to finally arrest Porter. Before Porter's arrest, Sawyer and her producer confronted the former priest at a local carnival. Porter initially tried to flee the cameras, and then turned and physically attacked the camera crew. After tackling the camera man, Porter fled on foot.|$|R

50|$|In late 2005, WBKI-TV {{entered into}} a news share {{agreement}} with ABC affiliate WHAS-TV (channel 11) to produce a nightly prime time newscast for the station; the program, known as WHAS 11 News at 10:00 on WBKI, premiered on January 2, 2006. After Block Communications began operating WBKI-TV under the LMA with WDRB and WMYO, the station chose not to renew the news share agreement with WDRB opting to launch its own newscast on channel 34 (as a result, WDRB {{became one of the}} few Fox stations to produce a newscast for another station in the same market). On September 17, 2012, WDRB began producing a half-hour weeknight 7:00 p.m. newscast, the WDRB Local Evening News at 7:00 on WBKI, which utilizes the same anchor team as that seen on WDRB's 6:30 p.m. newscast. This resulted in a rare situation in which two competing stations produced newscast for another station in the same market; WHAS-TV continued to produce the 10:00 p.m. newscast in the interim. The weekend <b>editions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>primetime</b> newscast were dropped after the September 30, 2012 broadcast; the weeknight editions followed suit one month later on October 26, leaving only the WDRB-produced early newscast.|$|R
