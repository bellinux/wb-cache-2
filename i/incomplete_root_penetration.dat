40|$|The role of {{the root}} system in {{mediating}} crop yields has recently been emphasised, resulting in several laboratory approaches for phenotyping root traits. We aimed to determine the existence of, and reasons for, genotypic variation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> of strong wax layers. Three contrasting groups (UK elite lines, CIMMYT lines and near-isogenic lines of cv Mercia containing dwarfing and semi-dwarfing Rht alleles) comprising 18 different genotypes with contrasting phenologies were studied. We determined the ability of roots of these genotypes to penetrate strong wax layers and the angular spread of the root systems. There were no intrinsic differences in root system ability to penetrate strong wax layers (consistent with the similar root diameter of all lines) since greater <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> was simply related to more root axes. Recording <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> of concentric zones of the wax layer demonstrated that cv. Battalion had a root system with a smaller angular spread than cv.

It is necessary to induce the formation of apical barrier (apical plug), enabling the complete root canal filling. Objective: This retrospective clinical study compared the protocols for {{treatment of}} teeth with <b>incomplete</b> <b>root</b> formation, using calcium hydroxide (CH) or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Material and methods: 28 patients with <b>incomplete</b> <b>root</b> formation have undergone root canal treatments in the period from 2000 to 2009 were selected. The procedures for cleaning, shaping and intracanal medication (CH paste) were performed in a standardized manner. In 13 patients, after using the CH paste (14 days), apical plugs with MTA were made.

40|$|The {{root cap}} assists {{the passage of}} the root through soil by means of its slimy {{mucilage}} secretion and by the sloughing of its outer cells. The <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> resistance of decapped primary roots of maize (Zea mays L. cv.

Root elongation rate and diameter were the same for decapped and intact roots when the plants were grown in loose soil. In compacted soil, however, the elongation rate of dec-apped roots was only about half that of intact roots, whilst the diameter was 30 % larger. <b>Root</b> <b>penetration</b> resistances of intact and decapped seminal axis were 0. 31 and 0. 52 MPa, respectively, when the roots were grown in compacted soil.

40|$|Biological soil crusts (BSCs) {{dominated}} by lichens are commonly found throughout arid and semiarid steppe {{communities of the}} Great Basin of North America. I conducted growth chamber experiments to investigate {{the effects of these}} crusts on seed germination and initial seedling establishment of two grasses: Bromus tectorum and Vulpia microstachys. These species share similarities in that they are both annual grasses with similar seed type. They differ, however, in that B. tectorum is non-native and highly invasive while V. microstachys is native to North America. For each ofthese species, I recorded germination time courses on bare soil and two types of biological soil crusts; one composed predominantly of the lichen Diploschistes muscorum (lichen crust) and the other comprised of an assortment of lichens and mosses (mixed crust). On the lichen crust, the final germination percentage (GP) for both grass species was about a third of that on the soil surface. In addition to differences in GP, the mean germination time (MGT) was three to four days longer on the lichen crust than on bare soil. In contrast to the lichen crust, the mixed crust did not reduce the GP or increase the MGT compared to the soil treatment. Similar results were observed in the two species studied.

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of arable land in south-western Australia is highly susceptible to subsoil compaction, which limits access of roots of wheat to water and nutrients at depth. Genotypic variation {{in the ability of}} roots to penetrate a hardpan has been reported for other cereals, using a pot technique, where a thin wax-layer of paraffin wax and petroleum jelly is placed in a soil column to simulate a hardpan. Previously we have modified and validated this technique for measuring <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability of wheat seedlings under contrasting water regimes. Here we report on a series of five experiments (runs), two in well-watered and three in drought stress conditions, which evaluated seminal and nodal <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability through thin wax layers among 24 Australian wheat cultivars and breeding lines (entries). These results were compared with observations on their rooting depths in two contrasting soil types in field trials, including a sandy duplex that contained a hardpan and a red clay that increased in soil strength with depth. Nodal roots ceased growth early under soil water deficit, and water uptake was instead dependant on seminal roots under conditions imposed in the pots. Plants were then reliant on the ability of seminal roots to penetrate the wax layer. Eight entries had superior <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> ability in both well-watered and drought stressed conditions. Roots of three other entries, which failed to penetrate the wax layers, died under drought stress conditions. In field trials, there was a significant interaction between site and entry for maximum root depth.

40|$|In this review, {{we examine}} how roots {{penetrate}} a structured soil. We first {{examine the relationship}} between soil water status and its mechanical strength, as well as the ability of the soil to supply water to the root. We identify these as critical soil factors, because it is primarily in drying soil that mechanical constraints limit root elongation. Water supply to the root is important because root water status affects growth pressures and root stiffness. To simplify the bewildering complexity of soil–root interactions, the discussion is focused around the special cases of root elongation in soil with pores much smaller than the root diameter and the <b>penetration</b> of <b>roots</b> at interfaces within the soil. While it is often assumed that the former case is well understood, many unan-swered questions remain. While low soil–root friction is often viewed as a trait conferring better penetration of strong soils, it may also increase the axial pressure on the root tip and in so doing reduce the rate of cell division and/or expansion. The precise trade-off between various root traits involved in root elongation in homogeneous soil remains to be determined. There is consensus that the most important factors determining <b>root</b> <b>penetration</b> at an interface are the angle at which the root attempts to penetrate the soil, root stiffness, and the strength of the soil to be penetrated.
