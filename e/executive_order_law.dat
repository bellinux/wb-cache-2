5000|$|The {{customary}} {{method by}} which agencies of the United States government are created, abolished, consolidated, or divided is through an act of Congress. The presidential reorganization authority essentially delegates these powers to the president for a defined period of time, permitting him to take those actions by decree.

How external (environmental and health) costs are factored into program evaluation is partly dependent on the enabling legislation (or <b>executive</b> <b>order).</b> If the <b>law</b> establishes Renewable Portfolio Standards, the energy regulator will need to oversee the system and evaluate its effectiveness in meeting RE objectives. Generally, some other agency is responsible for certifying the generators and handling the certification system.|$|R
50|$|With the {{discovery}} of gold near Canyon City in June 1862, and near Granite in July 1862, gold miners streamed into the area. The eminent geologist, Waldemar Lindgren, who visited the area in 1900, estimated that approximately $16 million in gold had been mined from the Canyon City area alone by that time. (In 1900, the value of gold was fixed at $20.67 per ounce, so that $16 million in gold would have been roughly 800,000 ounces—worth today $1,600 an ounce about $1.28 Billion) Mining remained the dominant sector of the area’s economy, with increasing lode-ore production annually, until October 1942 when the U. S. War Labor Board made gold mining illegal by <b>Executive</b> <b>Order,</b> Public <b>Law</b> L-208. This effectively led to several mining towns being abandoned and {{the demise of the}} mining industry in eastern Oregon and elsewhere; idle equipment was removed as scrap drives during World War II literally dismantled {{a great deal of the}} county’s mining infrastructure.

40|$|This article {{offers an}} approach, not an answer. It concludes {{that any of}} the three {{branches}} of government could permit women to serve in combat units. Women have been formally barred from serving in combat ships or aircraft by a 1948 law-the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Armed Services Integration Act. Because the sponsors of that legislation concluded {{that it was impossible to}} distinguish combat and noncombat roles in the Army, the Secretary of that service was given discretion to designate combat units which would be filled only by men. Congress could change the law. The judiciary could decide that the law, or the Army 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of discretion, was unconstitutionally discriminatory. The President could issue an <b>executive</b> <b>order</b> ameliorating the <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 7 s application. The nature of the inquiry into whether there should be a change, and the criteria applied, will differ depending on the branch of government involved. While that proposition is unremarkable, the distinction seems to have escaped the attention of most proponents and opponents of the combat exclusion laws.

40|$|Isolation and {{quarantine}} {{are public}} health practices used to stop or limit {{the spread of}} disease. Isolation is used to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease {{from those who are}} healthy. Isolation restricts the movement of ill persons to help stop the spread of certain diseases. For example, hospitals use isolation for patients with infectious tuberculosis. Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. These people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.
