Bodine is known for <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head, which has given him the nickname The Onion. He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 07 Chevrolet Camaro for SS-Green Light Racing.|$|E
25|$|White's form {{continued}} to decline the following season and {{he failed to}} reach a ranking final. However his results on the table were greatly overshadowed, when {{he was diagnosed with}} testicular cancer during the season. He was able to make a successful recovery after having his left testicle removed. Shortly after, White underwent further surgery to correct <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> spot.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. <b>His</b> <b>bald</b> head and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E

5000|$|Pete Marino - Detective Sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department. Described as [...] "pushing fifty, {{with a face}} {{life had}} chewed on, and long wisps of greying hair parted low {{on one side and}} combed over <b>his</b> <b>balding</b> pate. At least six feet tall, he was bay-windowed from decades of bourbon or beer." ...|$|R
25|$|In 458 BC, he {{returned}} to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455BC. Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny, in his Naturalis Historiæ, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy {{that he would be}} killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.|$|E
25|$|Kenzo Suzuki only {{wrestled}} {{one more}} match for CMLL after losing his hair, showing off <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head {{two weeks later}} on the December 29, 2006 Super Viernes where he teamed with El Terrible and Pierroth Jr. as the team lost to Dos Caras Jr., Lizmark Jr. and Rey Bucanero. While Suzuki left the promotion Corleone would continue to work for CMLL for a while, turning tecnico later on, partially due to the positive response of the Arena Mexico crowd. Shocker and Universo 2000 did not team up after the Sin Piedad victory. Los Guerreros del Infierno would hold the CMLL World Trios Championship to the Los Perros del Mal team of Perro Aguayo Jr., Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza. The Hiroka/Dark Angel storyline was ended without a proper resolution as Hiroka lost the CMLL World Women's Championship to Lady Apache only 10 days after the event.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the comic}} themes during the Chicago years {{was that of}} {{courtship}} and marriage, with much humor made from the supposed aversion of many Irish males to the altar. The local plumber, Dacey, does not fall to matrimony until he enters the wrong city building and comes out with a marriage license rather than one for a dog. The fireman Hannigan's courting of Dolan's daughter is broken off after fifteen years when he is embarrassed by her giving him a wig as a Christmas present to cover <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head; but for {{that she would be}} courted still. With Danny Duggan too shy to propose, Father Kelly acts on his behalf, resulting in [...] "the dear little colleen trembling and crying, but holding on to him like a pair of ice tongs".|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of William H. Henderson, a pioneer teacher, [s. d. ]. He is shown from his upper torso {{to his head}} and is looking straight ahead with his shoulders slightly turned to the left. He can be seen wearing a dark jacket, white shirt, and white bowtie.

2500|$|Caterpillars {{have been}} used symbolically in media to symbolize characters' {{positioning}} at or reluctance to progress past {{an early stage of}} development (e.g., in the Mad Men season 3 episode, [...] "The Fog", in which Betty Draper has a drug-induced dream, while in labor, that she captures a caterpillar and holds it firmly in her hand) or in combination with butterflies to show their maturation (e.g., in The Sopranos season 5 episode, [...] "The Test Dream", in which Tony Soprano dreams that Ralph Cifaretto has a caterpillar on <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head that changes into a butterfly).|$|E
2500|$|He {{is known}} to {{international}} audiences for his roles as khan in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi (1982) and as the main antagonist Mola Ram in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). He shaved his head for the role, and it created such an impression that he kept his head shaved. <b>His</b> <b>bald</b> look gave him the flexibility to experiment with different looks as a villain in subsequent movies. Puri and Spielberg shared a great rapport and Spielberg often said in interviews: [...] "Amrish is my favorite villain. The best {{the world has ever}} produced and ever will!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Messier was {{featured}} in a Lay's chips campaign that aired in Canada in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The commercials originally featured Messier being challenged to a bet by a local hockey fan, who bets that Messier cannot eat just one potato chip, {{in reference to the}} Lay's slogan [...] "bet you can't eat just one." [...] Messier loses the bet, and ends up playing in a local [...] "beer league" [...] hockey game (for a team called [...] "The Pylons"), which he easily dominates. Later variations would have Messier himself making the same bet. He was also featured in Lay's ads in the U.S. where he asked neighbors to borrow ice, sugar or a hairdryer (playing on <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head) to get chips.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of James W. Hellman, [s. d. ]. Mr. Hellman is shown {{from the upper}} torso to the head and {{is looking at the}} camera even though his body is turned to the left. He is wearing a dark suit and matching tie, as well as a white shirt. He has a pair of dark framed round glasses balanced on his large ears and nose. His thin dark hair is combed backwards over <b>his</b> <b>balding</b> head...|$|R

2500|$|Simplitas/Smith's Arcadian {{restaurant}} {{has become the}} rage of London, as the menu {{is that of the}} simple life. Simplitas, however, is not living and spreading the simple life as his Arcadian friends had hoped, but rather is having [...] "the time of his life." [...] Mrs. Smith becomes suspicious of Simplicitas, and in endeavouring to explain the reason for an all-night absence, he tells another lie. He falls into the ornamental well in the restaurant and emerges as his former self, with <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head and shaggy whiskers, to the astonishment and somewhat to the confusion of his wife. Sombra and Chrysea, realising that their mission to make all London tell the truth has failed, return to Arcadia – but they leave two happy couples behind.|$|E
2500|$|Hayes {{was back}} in 1973 with an {{acclaimed}} live double album, Live at the Sahara Tahoe, and followed {{it up with the}} album Joy, with the eerie beat of the 15-minute title track. He moved away from cover songs with this album. An edited [...] "Joy" [...] would be a hit single. In 1974, Hayes was featured in the blaxploitation films Three Tough Guys and Truck Turner, and he recorded soundtracks for both. Tough Guys was almost devoid of vocals and Truck Turner yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score of Truck Turner was eventually used by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in the Kill Bill film series, and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show Jornal de Esportes on the Jovem Pan station. Unlike most African-American musicians of the period, Hayes did not sport an Afro; <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head became one of his defining characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the title}} loss, he {{attacked}} The Miz with a knockout punch and hugged Teddy Long, turning {{face for the}} first time since 2008. Later on in the night as part of the 2010 WWE draft, Big Show was drafted back to the SmackDown brand. He returned to the brand on the April 30 episode of SmackDown and was subsequently named the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, later on in the night he interrupted World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger as he was giving his [...] "State of Championship Address" [...] and knocked him out with a WMD. On the May 7 episode of SmackDown, Big Show sat ringside during the Swagger/Kane main event. After Swagger was disqualified, Show chokeslammed him through the announce table. He also crashed Swagger's achievement celebration and cost him his match with Kofi Kingston in the next week. Big Show defeated Jack Swagger via disqualification at Over The Limit. On the May 27 episode of Smackdown, General Manager Thedore Long scheduled qualifying matches for the World Heavyweight Championship match at Fatal 4-Way and that Big Show had already qualified by defeating Jack Swagger via disqualification at Over the Limit. At Fatal 4-Way, Show faced Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship, but Mysterio won the title. The following night, Swagger debuted his new finishing move, The Ankle Lock, and applied it on Big Show, thus injuring his ankle and continuing their feud. Two weeks later on Smackdown, Big Show saved Rey Mysterio, whose ankle was injured by the same move, from Swagger. Later that night, Big Show fought Swagger to a double count-out. Soon he began a feud with CM Punk and his Straight Edge Society, confronting him the Friday night before the Money in the Bank event, and unmasking him to reveal <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> head. After failing to win the ladder match for the Money in the Bank contract, he fought the mysterious masked member of the SES, also unmasking him as Joey Mercury. Show's feud with the Straight Edge Society continued after he defeated them in a 3 on 1 Handicap match at SummerSlam and CM Punk at Night of Champions. Big Show was made Team SmackDown's captain for Bragging Rights on the October 8 episode of SmackDown. At the event, Big Show was counted out with Sheamus during the match but his team ultimately won with Edge and Rey Mysterio left on the team. He was on Rey Mysterio's team for Survivor Series where he was a survivor along with Mysterio. The following episode of SmackDown, he was unsuccessful in qualifying for King of the Ring as he was defeated by Alberto Del Rio by count-out thanks to interference by his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez.|$|E
60|$|He {{was not an}} {{especially}} popular man in his district, and he knew it. Physically he was big and stout, with a florid face and small eyes that blinked continually. <b>His</b> head was <b>bald,</b> <b>his</b> hands fat and red and his feet enormous.|$|R

50|$|As an on-camera performer, Baer was {{recognizable}} by his distinctive voice, his paunchy appearance, and <b>his</b> <b>balding</b> head. Often he portrayed fussy, bossy, and/or obstinate {{officials or}} neighbors. Extended television roles included blustering, by-the-book Mayor Stoner on The Andy Griffith Show, the neighbor Darby on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, frequent guest appearances on The Addams Family as insurance man and city commissioner Arthur J. Henson, {{and in the}} late 1990s, Miles Dugan on The Young and the Restless. He also appeared as a telephone executive on Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.|$|R

Holford refused to accept exile, stating instead his expectation {{that he would be}} executed at Tyburn or Boughton.
