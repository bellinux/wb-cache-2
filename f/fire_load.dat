50|$|The {{warehouse}} premises at 70/72 Kilbirnie Street {{was used}} as a cash and carry warehouse by the Sher Brothers company, selling textiles, clothing and household goods. It was built as a stables in 1899, but in common with much of Glasgow's industrial premises at that time, had seen numerous uses over the years. It was a brick built construction of ground, first and attic floors, connected by internal stairs and a goods lift. The first floor was of concrete construction, and the attic floor of composite steel and timber, supported on cast iron columns.

The testing technique involved the use of radiation-based heating units and digital imaging systems to measure deformations at elevated temperatures. Thirteen CFT beam-columns specimens were tested and the experimental results included the M- 2 ̆ 6 phis;-T responses of the plastic hinges. ^ 3 D finite element models and fiber-based section models were developed and calibrated for predicting the M- 2 ̆ 6 phis;-T behavior of the tested CFT beam-column specimens. These models provide significant insight and predict {{the behavior of the}} specimens with reasonable accuracy. ^ The stability behavior of CFT columns under <b>fire</b> <b>loading</b> was investigated using a simple analytical approach, which was developed by modifying Newmark’s method for inelastic buckling analysis to include: (a) the effects of elevated temperatures and (b) section fiber models (of M- 2 ̆ 6 phis;-T responses) at the station points. The analytical approach was used to predict the standard fire behavior and stability of several CFT columns tested by researchers around the world. The analytical predictions were verified by comparing them with: (a) experimental results and (b) analytical results predicted using 3 D finite element models. The comparisons indicated that the simple analytical approach could predict the standard fire behavior of CFT columns with reasonable accuracy. ^ The experimental approach for determining the fundamental behavior of structural members under <b>fire</b> <b>loading</b> is recommended for future research. The fiber-based section model for predicting the fundamental behavior of members under <b>fire</b> <b>loading</b> is also recommended for future development of modeling techniques.

Mirza Rafi Khan went to Harat. Zahiroddoleh interceded for him, his crime was pardoned." [...] In Qajar era, a hard conflict occurred between the chief town of Ghaenat and the chief town of [...] "Forg" [...] and [...] "Darmian" [...] which finally resulted in killing Mirza Rafi Khan and occupying the castle. Among the influential lieutenant governors within this time period, we can point out to Mirza Mohammad Baghakhan, son of the first Mirza Rafi Khan, the second Mirza Rafi Khan, the third Mirza Rafi Khan, Mohammad Ebrahim Khan, Abdolali Khan and Aligholi Khan. After the third Mirza Rafikhan having been killed, those of the same dynasty took the responsibility of lieutenant governor in Darmian and Forg. Among the considerable points about Darmian's lieutenant governors, is the struggles occurred between this lieutenant governor with Khozeimeh family who were ruling Birjand. These conflicts have also been mentioned in Divan-e-Lame, including partiality of Lame's family from Nader Shah and Khozeimeh from Safavids which caused dispute, conflict and competition. These competitions sometimes associated with marriage between the family of Rafiei and Khozeimeh, in this way not only it was trying to make inconspicuous the local conflicts and differences, but also to strengthen relationship and unity between them with other lieutenant governors and elders of the area. In the same way, six daughters of the second Mriza Rafi Khan married with the great persons and lieutenant governors of Birjand, Nehbandan, Fanoud and Noghab. The non-written documents and instruments in respect of the events related to the date of construction or historical and natural disasters that have taken place in this complex are limited and it needs more digging and studies. The only inscription carved on the mortar surface of the water storage of the castle indicates the lunar date of 1217 and suggests that the building was repaired by an artisan named [...] "Abosaeid Jaiki" [...] in the early Qajar era. The studies made on the local history of the region is also greatly in consistency with the dates and the sovereignty of Mirza Bakhakhan and after him, his children and his offspring especially the second Mirza Rafi Khan and the third Mirza Rafi Khan certifies the foregoing matters. However, there is little documented information on the matter that whether the castle had been existed before sovereignty of Rafiei family as the local governors or not. Description of this castle and its situation have been recorded in come historic books and itineraries, for example, Riazi Heravi writes in Einolvaghayeh Book as follows: [...] "Forg Castle is 12 miles away from Birjand and locates around plain and entrance of [...] "Darmian" [...] valley and has a lot of gardens and trees and enjoys a good climate, the castle is {{on the top of a}} mountain of which walls and towers have been firmly constructed by mud bricks and its foundation was made by Ajin stone and has two Haji Shir around itself and two embankments each of which diameter is five cubits. The European tourists such as [...] "Doctor Forbes" [...] in 1814 AD, [...] "Colonel Mac GERGER" [...] in 1875, and [...] "Khanykf" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] have visited the castle and have stated descriptions in their itineraries. Colonel Mac GARGAR also brought about the words of Doctor Forbes in his itinerary titled [...] "A Journey to the Province of Khorasan" [...] as follows: [...] "The castle has been built on the top of a hill at an altitude of 2000 to 2500 feet which could be threatened by the <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> from the highlands of the north and west. A mountain is located in the south and on the other two sides which is away 1200 yards from the peak to the walls of the castle. An interesting point that Mac GERGER said as quoted by Doctor Forbes is: [...] "Three water storages were provided inside the castle which is said that the storage of their water will supply the utility of a great garrison for the period of one year and six months.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} a <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> density survey carried out in Ouro Preto {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil are presented. The {{inventory}} method is used and details of the survey methodology and processing are given. Forty-three buildings are surveyed and the determination of <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> density is made for 39 occupancies, each occupancy comprising one or more rooms, or even an entire building. The average <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> density is 2989 MJ/m 2 and the standard deviation is 2833 MJ/m 2. Commercial stores are found to be the most heavily loaded but a single maximum <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> density of 14, 560 MJ/m 2 is found in a drugstore. Because of new extensions of old buildings, some rooms have relatively low fire loads. It is observed that wood contributes a substantial portion of <b>fire</b> <b>load,</b> being 35 % of movable <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> and 37 % of fixed <b>fire</b> <b>load.</b> Comparison of the results, with those established by Brazilian standard NBR 14432, indicate that measured values could exceed standard values by up to a factor of 10.

40|$|The report {{reviews the}} effect of surface area and {{thickness}} of fire loads in predicting {{the value of the}} heat release rate. The investigation arises from current Ph. D research at the University of Canterbury identifying the need for <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> data, which also includes the exposed surface area of the fuel items, so that the rate and duration of burning can be better assessed, especially during post-flashover fires. This is because at some stage of the fire, the fuel is no longer dependent on the ventilation characteristics but the surface area exposed to the fire. The investigation of {{the effect of}} surface and thickness on <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> is first carried out with the burning of single items, such as furniture normally found in each building occupancy. Later, <b>fire</b> <b>load</b> surveys on a range of typical building occupancies, such as university offices, motels and residential are conducted. Simple models for calculating the surface area of the <b>fire</b> <b>load,</b> especially for wood and plastic materials have been determined. Based on the methodology developed for the investigation, it is found that the larger the exposure of the fuel surface area to the fire, the higher the heat release rate, and the thicker the fuel, the longer the duration of burning. In other words, the value of the heat release rate {{is a function of the}} surface area, while the duration of burning is a function of the thickness of the fuel.
