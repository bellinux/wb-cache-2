500|$|Gabler {{credits the}} studio's {{marketing}} team for being [...] "really creative". Fox saw {{the film as}} [...] "counterprogramming" [...] on the weekend Superman Returns was released. While {{they knew that the}} material and Hathaway would help draw a younger female audience that would not be as interested in seeing that film, [...] "e didn’t want it to <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> like a chick flick coming out." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Lee was {{inducted}} into the Alabama Academy of Honor. In the same year, Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley initiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book, To Kill a Mockingbird, as the first title of the One City, One Book program. Lee declared that [...] "there is no greater honor the novel could receive". By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel. David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervised The Big Read, states [...] "people <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the album's {{tracks are}} about {{rock and roll}} itself–Angus stated, [...] "Certain songs <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to come to life when you add that phrase". However, other themes served as inspiration. [...] "Money Made" [...] is a {{criticism}} on how, according to Angus, in the US [...] "everything is money these days". [...] "War Machine" [...] {{was based on a}} documentary on Hannibal, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} military has not changed since Ancient Rome. [...] "Wheels" [...] tells about Johnson's passion for motorcars. He described the album's release as the [...] "best one we've done", he felt that while Back in Black was great for its time, Black Ice shows the band's versatility. Angus also said he admired the album's diversity, saying [...] "It is sufficiently varied to please people in varied moods".|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century WNO gave more than 120 {{performances}} a year, with a repertoire, generally, of eight full-scale operas. Its regular audience figures totalled over 150,000 annually, in ten principal venues, three of them in Wales and seven in England. During this period the company was criticised for being insufficiently Welsh. A local politician, Adam Price, said that WNO ought to have a Welsh musical director; Alun Hoddinott said in 2004, [...] "WNO has put on perhaps four or five Welsh operas over 20 years. ... They <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to have an anti-Welsh music bias. I am sad that they do not do something for Welsh composers, especially young ones." [...] A more positive view of WNO came from Scotland, where the two main newspapers, The Scotsman and The Herald, greeted a visit from the company in 2005 with enthusiastic praise, contrasting the flourishing of opera in Wales with its neglect by politicians in Scotland and the consequent decline of Scottish Opera. In 2010 WNO commissioned Gair ar Gnawd ("Word on Flesh"), by Pwyll ap Siôn and Menna Elfyn, with words in Welsh, described as [...] "a contemporary story about Wales today ... inspired by the translation of the Bible".|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ebony writer Phyl Garland {{described}} the album as [...] "Jesus Christ Superstar {{on a bad}} trip", also stating [...] "The whole thing <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> so unnecessary." ...|$|R

2500|$|Much {{like other}} Barcelona youth {{products}} such as Pep Guardiola, Xavi and Iván de la Peña, Iniesta is a playmaker who relies on exceptional creative passing, intuition and inventiveness to control the midfield and dictate {{the ebb and flow}} of play. Iniesta has been praised for his understanding and interplay with Xavi; former Barcelona teammate Giovanni van Bronckhorst said of the pair, [...] "They have a special relationship, they always have, they <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to know where the other one is." [...] During his maturation as a player, he has gained a reputation for playing a part in important goals for club and country, specifically playing a leading role in the 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015 UEFA Champions League finals, as well as the 2010 World Cup Final, Euro 2012 final and Euro 2008 semi-final.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 January 2009, Moyles made {{comments}} {{on his radio}} show regarding the family history programme Who Do You Think You Are? and the Holocaust. Referring to his trips while filming the programme, Moyles said [...] "I went off to Ireland and other places to film and {{unlike a lot of}} the Who Do You Think You Are? shows I didn't go to Auschwitz. Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to pass through there on their way to Florida". Celebrities featured on Who Do You Think You Are? including Stephen Fry, Jerry Springer and Natasha Kaplinsky, have traced their family histories back to Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Second World War. The BBC released a statement: “Anyone who listens to the Chris Moyles Show will know he has an irreverent style. However, we regret that on this occasion his comments were misjudged and we are speaking to Chris and his team about them.” ...|$|E

The poor fields <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> pitiful {{to me and}} the trees seem to be {{stretching}} out their hands pleading for rain. As for my garden, it hurts me every time I go into it. I suppose I shouldn't complain about a garden when the farmers' crops are suffering so. Mr. Harrison says his pastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get {{a bite to eat}} and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|The second Good Samaritan {{knew that}} one of the wires in the {{distributor}} must be detached and, though she assured him that she had inspected them, he looked pityingly at her smart sports-suit, said, [...] "Well, I'll just take a look," [...] and removed the distributor cover. He also scratched his head, felt of the fuses under the cowl, scratched his cheek, poked a finger at the carburetor, rubbed his ear, said, [...] "Well, uh----" [...] looked {{to see if there was}} water and gas, sighed, [...] "Can't <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to find out what's the trouble," [...] shot at his own car, and escaped.|$|E

60|$|As if in {{this second}} Figure you suppose A to {{represent}} a small sight or hole, through which the eye looks upon an object, as C, through the Glass-bubble B, and the second sight L; all which remain exactly fixt in their several places, the object C being so cized and placed, that it may <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to touch the upper and under edge of the hole L: and so all of it be seen through the small Glass-ball of rarified Air; then by breaking off the small seal'd neck of the Bubble (without at all stirring the sights, object, or glass) and admitting the external Air, you will find your self unable to see the utmost ends of the object; but the terminating rayes AE and AD (which were before refracted to G and F by the rarified Air) will proceed almost directly to I and H; which alteration of the rayes (seeing {{there is no other}} alteration made in the Organ by which the Experiment is tryed, save only the admission, or exclusion of the condens'd Air) must necessarily be caused by the variation of the medium contain'd in the Glass B; the greatest difficulty in the making of which Experiment, is from the uneven surfaces of the bubble, which will represent an uneven image of the object.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't bear to have Walter go," [...] she wrote. [...] "I love Jem ever so {{much but}} Walter means {{more to me}} than anyone in the world and I would die if he had to go. He seems so changed these days. He hardly ever talks to me. I suppose he wants to go, too, and feels badly because he can't. He doesn't go about with Jem and Jerry at all. I shall never forget Susan's face when Jem came home in his khaki. It worked and twisted as if she were going to cry, but all she said was, 'You look almost like a man in that, Jem.' Jem laughed. He never minds because Susan thinks him just a child still. Everybody seems busy but me. I wish there was {{something}} I could do but there doesn't seem to be anything. Mother and Nan and Di are busy all the time and I just wander about like a lonely ghost. What hurts me terribly, though, is that mother's smiles, and Nan's, <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> put on from the outside. Mother's eyes never laugh now. It makes me feel that I shouldn't laugh either--that it's wicked to feel laughy. And it's so hard for me to keep from laughing, even if Jem {{is going to be a}} soldier. But when I laugh I don't enjoy it either, as I used to do. There's something behind it all that keeps hurting me--especially when I wake up in the night. Then I cry because I am afraid that Kitchener of Khartoum is right and the war will last for years and Jem may be--but no, I won't write it. It would make me feel as if it were really going to happen. The other day Nan said, 'Nothing can ever be quite the same for any of us again.' It made me feel rebellious. Why shouldn't things be the same again--when everything is over and Jem and Jerry are back? We'll all be happy and jolly again and these days will seem just like a bad dream.|$|E
