40|$|Abstract—Currently, {{hygienic}} {{conditions of}} public tableware and kitchenware {{have become a}} hot social concern. This work aimed at solving existing problems in detecting the presence of bacteria, a constant-temperature incubator for the paper strip method was designed and a related temperature-control system was developed. Firstly, the detection method and working principle of the incubator were elaborated upon. Using a paper strip, Escherichia coli (E. coli) was collected from the tableware to be examined. The paper strip was then placed in the incubator for a constant-temperature culture. Through chromogenic reaction, the hygienic condition of the tableware could be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by analyzing the image information on the paper strip. Subsequently, {{with regard to the}} <b>heater</b> <b>band,</b> a wrapping pattern was designed and a suitable material was chosen. Three types of temperature sensors were compared, and a platinum resistor was finally selected and installed at the proper position. Additionally, an electronic thermostat was chosen. Conclusively, the designed incubator, which integrated the constant-temperature culture and image acquisition system, could detect the temperature accurately, reliably, and conveniently in real time, and could also detect the hygienic condition of public tableware rapidly and effectively.

40|$|The heat pipe, {{a sealed}} chamber whose walls {{are lined with}} a "wick," a thin {{capillary}} network containing a working fluid in liquid form was developed for a heat distribution system for non-rotating satellites. Use of the heat pipe provides a continuous heat transfer mechanism. "Heat tubes" that improve temperature control in plastics manufacturing equipment incorporated the heat pipe technology. James M. Stewart, an independent consultant, patented the heat tubes he developed and granted a license to Kona Corporation. The Kona Nozzle for heaterless injection molding gets heat for its operation from an external source and has no internal heating bands, reducing machine maintenance and also eliminating electrical hazards associated with <b>heater</b> <b>bands.</b> The nozzles are used by Eastman Kodak, Bic Pen Corporation, Polaroid, Tupperware, Ford Motor Company, RCA, and Western Electric in the molding of their products...|$|R

Silicone coated drum heaters are suitable for steel drums, whereas polyester coatings at lower temperatures {{can be used for}} plastic containers. As these heaters are flexible and wrap around the container they also called <b>band</b> <b>heaters.</b> Up to three <b>band</b> <b>heaters</b> can be applied to a standard 200 litre barrel. There is no additional insulation so heat is lost by radiation into the surrounding air and the surface temperatures can be hot enough to burn unprotected hands.|$|R
50|$|CD {{moulding}} {{machines are}} specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per moulding line. Clear polycarbonate pellets are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into {{one end of the}} injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the injection chamber via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with <b>heater</b> <b>bands</b> ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is closed the screw moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds.|$|R
50|$|These {{electrical}} drum heaters have {{an outer}} layer of insulation {{to protect the}} user and to increase energy efficiency as significantly less heat is lost to the atmosphere, and thus their power consumption is considerably less than <b>band</b> <b>heaters.</b> Typically {{they are designed to}} cover the entire surface of the drum or container.|$|R

40|$|Gastric angiodysplasia is a {{very rare}} cause of upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding {{in children and adolescents}} and {{is considered to be a}} vascular abnormality with a developmental cause. Gastric angiodysplasia can be managed with various endoscopic methods, including argon plasma coagulation, electrocoagulation, <b>heater</b> probe, sclerotherapy, <b>band</b> ligation, and hemoclipping therapy. We describe a case of gastric angiodysplasia in a 12 -year-old boy with hematemesis and melena. Gastroduodenoscopy showed a typical lesion of angiodysplasia with oozing on the posterior wall of the gastric body. We successfully performed endoscopic hemoclipping therapy to heal the bleeding lesion, and no recurrence of bleeding was observed on follow-up.

40|$|A {{feeding method}} {{for use with}} {{bituminous}} coals that exhibit plasticity at elevated temperatures is described and demonstrated on a small screw extruder previously used to extrude polyethylene. A metered feed of coal heated to a temperature just below that of incipient caking (approximately 450 C) is used. Modifications to the extruder consisting of ceramic <b>band</b> <b>heaters,</b> auxiliary cooling coils on the thrust bearing and special quick opening dies are detailed. Coals successfully extruded include high volatile A bituminous coals, high volatile B bituminous coals, a high volatile C bituminous coal and a coal with high ash content. The computer program, EXTRUD, used to simulate the extruder is described. Predicted power consumption exhibits 30 % scatter, which is explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} coal friction coefficient to temperature profiles. Detailed analysis reveals some discrepancies in the program that need to be resolved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{closed loop}} {{controller}} {{is designed for}} regulation of the volumetric output flow in a polymer extruder. To this aim, temperature and pressure at the machine output must be controlled {{on the basis of}} real time measurements. It has been verified that temperature and pressure regulations can be achieved by solving two disjoint control problems. The temperature controller acts on the heat delivered to the plastic material by the <b>heater</b> electric resistance <b>bands</b> on the barrel; the pressure controller uses as a control action the voltage applied to the screw electrical engine in order to obtain real time modulation of the screw revolution speed. The designed control system shows very good performances in regulation of the flow output and good robustness properties to variations in the operating conditions and the material properties.

40|$|The {{temperature}} of the polymer melt {{plays an important role}} in injection molding, directly affecting the quality of the molded part. A new barrel, nozzle, and crew tip were constructed for an injection molding machine to allow the installation a Vanzetti infrared optical fiber temperature sensor and several exposed junction thermocouples. These sensors were compared for the measurement of polymer melt temperature. Open loop pseudo-random binary sequence experiments were performed to obtain dynamic temperature models for nozzle melt temperature when the <b>band</b> <b>heater</b> power was varied. The open loop response of the nozzle melt temperature was found to be second order overdamped with a dead time. Process control simulations were done with the PID, Dahlin, a second order modified Dahlin, and Smith predictor control algorithms in order to determine the optimum parameters for the controllers and to compare their responses. Experiments using the PID and the Dahlin controller were performed, with step changes in set points and disturbances introduced into the system...|$|R
40|$|In this project, a {{flash drum}} {{is going to}} be studied as a method to {{concentrate}} a stream with nanoparticles continuously at bench scale. Several aspects are going to be analysed, such as the removal of water produced in the flash, the dragging of product that is carried by the vapour and the hydrodynamic size of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method at high pressure in a counter-current nozzle reactor, patented by the University of Nottingham [1]. Afterward, the pressure was released and the stream was concentrated using a flash drum and separating the vapour from the liquid. Several designs of the flash drum have been tested, for example providing the rig with more insulation or adding a <b>band</b> <b>heater,</b> obtaining better results in the separation of the liquid and vapour. In some cases, the amount of solids carried by the vapour was measured as well in order to know the amount of product that is not possible to recover. OtroGrado en Ingeniería Químic...|$|R
30|$|Impedance (dielectric) {{spectroscopy}} (IS) {{measurements were}} performed on samples using a specially designed airtight sample holder [3, 9]. Temperature controllers connected to <b>band</b> <b>heaters</b> placed externally around the cylindrical chambers are monitored by thermocouples (type K) inserted inside its metallic walls. The constructed sample holder allows controlling both the temperature (from room temperature up to T ~  200  °C) and relative humidity. Nafion samples were sandwiched with carbon cloths, to facilitate water equilibration, between stainless steel spring-load contact terminals, insulated from the chamber walls. Before studying the electric properties of the ionomer, several experiments were performed to ensure the correct assessment of the bulk properties of the sample under investigation. Some of the parameters checked were different electrode materials (platinum, gold, carbon cloth), different membrane thicknesses, and the short-circuited sample holder. Such series of experiments are important to separate contributions arising from the sample holder (and connection cables) and electrodes from the sample itself. In a recent report, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed {{as a function of}} time under an applied dc potential in order to verify whether electrode polarization is observed in IS data of Nafion. Such experiments revealed morphology changes under the applied potential in the same timeframe of the impedance spectroscopy measurements, further indicating that electrical data correspond to the bulk properties of Nafion samples [12].|$|R
40|$|The thermoacoustic {{flashover}} detector is {{a device}} {{designed to be}} mounted on the helmet of a firefighter which creates a loud whistle when exposed to conditions {{that are consistent with}} flashover in order to provide firefighters with a warning and time to escape. The detector is based off a previous device designed at the University of Maryland which was operated using an electric <b>band</b> <b>heater.</b> This device was optimized by slightly altering the stack design and by the addition of approximately 0. 3 mL of water to the stack, yielding an activation temperature of 125 °C. Once the activation temperature was sufficiently lowered, the device was outfitted with copper fins which were designed to collect radiant heat from a propane-burning radiant panel and transfer it to the detector. When using four of these copper fins and exposed to a radiant heat flux of approximately 25 kW/m 2, the detector activated around 125 °C after 7 minutes. This was the first known activation of a thermoacoustic device to unconcentrated thermal radiation. The response time of the device was lowered after two more fins were added to the design. Once the detector was shown to work using radiant heat, it was tested at the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute (MFRI) at the University of Maryland using full scale fires in order to replicate the conditions in which it would be expected to operate. While the detector did not activate during the full scale tests, the radiant panel tests proved that the design is feasible and that some slight design changes are needed in order for the detector to operate in a real fire environment...|$|R
40|$|The thermoacoustic {{flashover}} detector integrates {{the phenomenon}} of thermoacoustics into a fire fighting application. This report presents the prototype design for the thermoacoustic flashover detector to ultimately be implemented in a firefighter's gear. Upon increases in compartment fire heat flux and temperature corresponding to the onset of flashover, the device will produce a loud warning tone to alert the firefighter that flashover is impending. This is critical because post-flashover, the fire transitions to an untenable environment for a firefighter, as well as compromised structural integrity of the building. The current design produces a tone at 115 dB at about 500 Hz upon heating from an external <b>band</b> <b>heater</b> and cooling via an ice/water bath. At 38 mm from the device, this sound level is louder than the 85 dB from fire alarms and distinct from the 3000 Hz tone of smoke detectors. The minimum power input to the device for sound onset is 44 Watts, corresponding to a temperature difference of 150 degrees Celsius at a mean temperature of 225 degrees Celsius across a 2 cm long porous steel wool stack. The temperatures at the hot and cold ends of the stack are 300 and 150 degrees Celsius respectively, which is achieved with a response time of ~ 100 seconds. The sound is sustained {{as long as there}} is a minimum power input of 31 Watts. Although the measurement uncertainties are estimated at 10 degrees Celsius for the temperatures and 5 Watts for the power input, this design provides a foundation for future improvement and quantification of the device. The mechanisms of the thermoacoustics at work and the materials selected for the prototype are presented. Different power level inputs to the device are analyzed and temperatures for operation are determined. Suggestions for future optimization and integration of the device into firefighters' gear are presented...|$|R
40|$|The Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch at the NASA Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a three-axis high-temperature magnetic bearing suspension rig to enhance {{the safety of the}} bearing system up to 1000 F. This test rig can accommodate thrust and radial bearings up to a 22. 84 cm (9 in.) diameter with a maximum axial loading of 22. 25 kN (5000 lb) and a maximum radial loading up to 4. 45 kN (1000 lb). The test facility was set up to test magnetic bearings under high-temperature (1100 F) and high-speed (20, 000 rpm) conditions. The magnetic bearing is located at the center of gravity of the rotor between two high-temperature grease-packed mechanical ball bearings. The drive-end duplex angular contact ball bearing, which is in full contact, acts as a moment release and provides axial stability. The outboard end ball bearing has a 0. 015 -in. radial clearance between the rotor to act as a backup bearing and to compensate for axial thermal expansion. There is a 0. 020 -in. radial air gap between the stator pole and the rotor. The stator was wrapped with three 1 -kW <b>band</b> <b>heaters</b> to create a localized hot section; the mechanical ball bearings were outside this section. Eight threaded rods supported the stator. These incorporated a plunger and Bellville washers to compensate for radial thermal expansion and provide rotor-to-stator alignment. The stator was instrumented with thermocouples and a current sensor for each coil. Eight air-cooled position sensors were mounted outside the hot section to monitor the rotor. Another sensor monitored this rotation of the outboard backup bearing. Ground fault circuit interrupts were incorporated into all power amplifier loops for personnel safety. All instrumentation was monitored and recorded on a LabView-based data acquisition system. Currently, this 12 -pole heteropolar magnetic bearing has 13 thermal cycles and over 26 hr of operation at 1000 F...|$|R
