25|$|The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus planiceps) {{is a small}} {{wild cat}} native to the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. Since 2008, it has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to {{destruction}} of wetlands in its habitat. It is suspected that the effective population size could be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals, with no subpopulation having an effective population size with more than 250 adult individuals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> is {{primarily}} threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves {{over the past}} decade has been rapid in tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and {{is likely to be a}} significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> was {{initially}} {{placed in the}} genus Felis by Vigors and Horsfield, who first described the cat in 1827 from Sumatra. In 1951, Ellerman and Morrison-Scott grouped Felis planiceps with Felis viverrina, the fishing cat, as being distributed in Lower Siam, the Malay States, Sumatra and Borneo, and recorded from Patani. In 1961, it was subordinated to the genus Prionailurus by the German biologist Weigel who compared fur pattern of wild and domestic felids. In 1997, researchers from the National Cancer Institute confirmed this taxonomic ranking following their phylogenetic studies.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{threatened}} by trapping, snaring and poisoning. <b>Flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> have been captured in traps {{set out to}} protect domestic fowl.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> {{are very}} rare in captivity, {{with fewer than}} ten individuals, all kept in Malaysian and Thai zoos as {{recorded}} by ISIS.|$|R
25|$|Although <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> are {{not known}} to be a {{specific}} target for poachers in Southeast Asia, side-catch poaching in small snares might pose an additional threat for the species. In fragmented landscapes motor vehicle collisions and direct competition with domestic cats could pose more serious threats.|$|R
25|$|The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> is {{distinguished}} at once by the extreme {{depression of the}} skull, which extends along the nose to the extremity of the muzzle, the sides of which are laterally distended. The general habit of body is slender, and the extremities are delicate and lengthened. The head itself is more lengthened and cylindrical than in the domestic cat. The distance between the eyes and the ears is comparatively great. The cylindrical form and lateral contraction of the head is contrasted by an unusual length of the teeth. The canine teeth are nearly as long as in an individual of double its size.|$|E
25|$|The thick fur is reddish-{{brown on}} top of the head, dark roan brown on the body, and mottled white on the underbelly. The face is lighter in color than the body, and the muzzle and chin are white. Two {{prominent}} buff whitish streaks run {{on either side of the}} nose between the eyes. The ears are rounded. The eyes are unusually far forward and close together, compared with other cats, giving the felid improved stereoscopic vision. The teeth are adapted for gripping onto slippery prey, and the jaws are relatively powerful. These features help the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> to catch and retain aquatic prey, to which it is at least as well adapted as the fishing cat. Legs are fairly short. Claws are retractable, but the covering sheaths are so reduced in size that about two-thirds of the claws are left protruding.|$|E
2500|$|Flat-headed cats were {{recorded}} in the Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia in 2013. As the Pasoh Forest Reserve contains no major rivers or lakes and is generally covered by hill dipterocarp forest, this detection provides new evidence of the species’s potential habitat range. The reserve ranks as low probability of occurrence in a previously published species distribution model. Pasoh's surrounding landscape is dominated by plantations that have been established since the 1970s. The detection, occurring < [...] from oil palm plantations, suggests that the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> is more tolerant of changes in its surrounding environment than previously assumed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> {{is restricted to}} lowland tropical rainforests in extreme southern Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei Darussalam, Kalimantan and [...] Sumatra. They primarily occur in freshwater habitats near coastal and lowland areas. More than 70% of records were collected less than [...] away from water.|$|R

In captivity, both {{females and males}} spray urine by walking forward in a crouching position, leaving a trail on the ground. Anecdotal historical accounts report that <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> are nocturnal, but an adult captive female was crepuscular and most active between 8:00 and 11:30 and between 18:00 and 22:00 hours. The stomach contents of an adult shot on a Malaysian riverbank consisted only of fish. They have been observed to wash objects, raccoon-style. Live fish are readily taken, with full submergence of the head, and the fish were usually carried at least two meters away, suggesting a feeding strategy to avoid letting aquatic prey escape back into water. Captive specimens show much greater interest in potential prey in the water than on dry land, suggesting a strong preference for riverine hunting in their natural habitat. Their morphological specialization suggest that their diet is mostly composed of fish, but they are reported to hunt for frogs, and are thought to catch crustaceans. They also catch rats and chicken.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Toxoplasma gondii can infect {{all species}} of warm-blooded animals, {{including}} humans, and causes serious diseases in immunocompromized hosts. Live tachyzoites derived from serial passage in HeLa culture {{were used in}} the Sabin-Feldman dye test for detection of Toxoplasma gondii antibody in serum samples of 21 captive wild felids including one fishing cat (Prion nailurus viverrina), one leopard (Panthera pardus), two <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cats</b> (Prion nailurus planiceps), 6 tigers (Panthera tigris), two leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), two clouded leopards (Felis nebulosa), 3 pumas (Puma concolor), and 4 jungle cats (Felis chaus). Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were founded in 9 of 21 felids (42. 8 %). This study revealed that cell culture-derived tachyzoites can be used successfully as a source of live organisms in a gold standard Sabin-Feldman dye test, which is simpler, cheaper and less ethically sensitive than in vivo inoculation.

40|$|The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus planiceps) is a wetland specialist, {{currently}} facing {{habitat loss}} on a serious scale due to massive destruction of lowland forests and wetlands in Southeast Asia. Despite its ‘endangered’ {{status in the}} IUCN Red List, there has virtually been no investigation on the population structure nor on the evolutionary history of the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat.</b> To fill this gap, we used full mitochondrial genome sequences, obtained from archival samples, covering the historical distribution of the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat.</b> Our data revealed a high genetic differentiation (Fst = 0. 81, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) between mitochondrial lineages from Borneo and those from Thai-Malay Peninsula/Sumatra, a split that was dated to ~ 575 Kya. Such a significant differentiation clearly distinguishes the Bornean <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> population from all other populations and suggests {{that there should be}} a reassessment of the flat-headed cat’s intraspecific taxonomy. However, morphological and nuclear data are required to corroborate our mtDNA results. Until such data become available, we recommend that for future conservation efforts and captive breeding programmes the two genetically distinct <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> populations are managed separately as two lineages to maintain the original genetic diversity of this endangered species...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus planiceps) {{is one of}} the world's least known, highly {{threatened}} felids with {{a distribution}} restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of camera-trapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat.</b> Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World). Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats (> 50 % explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC 2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54 % and 68 % of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e. g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10 % and 20 % of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The <b>flat-headed</b> <b>cat</b> can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region...|$|E
