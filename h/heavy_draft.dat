5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft.</b> The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E
5|$|Selection {{for what}} {{eventually}} became the Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> was begun in 1860 at the Deposito Cavalli Stalloni (military stud) of Ferrara, Italy. The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses. While the resulting horses were strong, {{they were not}} light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians. To make the breed lighter and faster, Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added. However, the resulting horse was still not exactly what its creators were looking for, and in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix, bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits. In 1926, a stud book was begun, and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities. The breeding programs suffered during World War II, but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes, Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> to its current state.|$|E
50|$|The breed {{became popular}} {{throughout}} the Baltic countries for its strength and suitability for farm work. Horses of the breed {{were sold to}} Russia as early as in the 14th and 15th centuries. they were also imported to Sweden {{for the needs of}} the military. Development of agriculture resulted in good working horses becoming even more desirable, and many Estonian Horses were crossbred with <b>heavier</b> <b>draft</b> horses to create stronger animals.|$|R
60|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were large, commodious, and gorgeously decorated. In each was seated a female Martian loaded with ornaments of metal, with jewels and silks and furs, and upon {{the back of}} each of the beasts which drew the chariots was perched a young Martian driver. Like the animals upon which the warriors were mounted, the <b>heavier</b> <b>draft</b> animals wore neither bit nor bridle, but were guided entirely by telepathic means.|$|R
60|$|Pippo was staggered, for, just drunk {{enough to}} be audacious, he had not all his faculties at his perfect command, and his usual acumen was a little at fault. Still, {{accustomed}} to brave public opinion, and to carry himself through the failures of his exhibitions by <b>heavier</b> <b>drafts</b> on the patience and credulity of his audience, he determined to persevere as the most likely way of extricating himself from the menaced consequences of his indiscretion.|$|R
5|$|The head is well-proportioned {{and similar}} to that of the Selle Francais, with wide nostrils, small ears and a {{straight}} or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes roached. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in <b>heavy</b> <b>draft</b> breeds, and the croup muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draft breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.|$|E
5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> or St. Lawrence, which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular export to New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the St. Lawrence, was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US trotting horses.|$|E
5|$|The Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> was {{originally}} bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture, urban settings, and military capacities, {{as well as}} for the production of large mules for the military. The breed's docility, size, strength, and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization. It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical. The mares are also still used for the production of mules, although most horses today are bred for meat. Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006. Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the Westphalian horse is linked with the State Stud of Warendorf, {{which was founded in}} 1826 to serve both the Prussian provinces of Westphalia and Rheinland. The stud was built under the Prussian Stud Administration, which was put {{together}} by King Frederick William I in 1713 to improve horse breeding efforts in the German-speaking region. Government-owned studs, identified as [...] "State" [...] or [...] "Principal" [...] studs depending on whether the facility keeps its own herd of mares, purchase stallions that fit the needs of the surrounding region.

5|$|The Trait du Nord, {{previously}} {{also known}} as Ardennais du Nord or Ardennais de type Nord, is a breed of <b>heavy</b> <b>draft</b> horse developed and bred {{in the area of}} Hainaut in western Belgium and in northeastern France. Originally considered a subtype of the Ardennes, it was recognized as an individual breed with the opening of a studbook in 1903. Developed in the fertile Flemish grasslands, it was bred for size and pulling power for agricultural work. By 1855, the horses bred near Hainaut were considered by some veterinarians to be superior to other Flemish draft breeds. The Trait du Nord was used extensively in mining from the late 19th century through 1920, with lesser use continuing through the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s, the Boulonnais were {{imported}} {{in large numbers}} to the United States and were quite popular in France; however, the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th-century wars. The breed nearly became extinct following World War II, but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for horse meat. Breed numbers remain low; {{it is estimated that}} fewer than 1,000 horses remain in Europe, mostly in France, with a few in other nations. Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population, and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should be a priority for conservation within France. The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, while the larger varieties performed <b>heavy</b> <b>draft</b> work, both on farms and in the cities. The Boulonnais was also crossbred to create and refine several other draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|The Ardennes or Ardennais {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breeds of draft horse, and {{originates}} from the Ardennes area in Belgium, Luxembourg and France. They are heavy-boned with thick legs and are used for draft work. The Ardennes is found in many colors, although black horses are very rare and are not allowed to be registered with the breed registry. Their history reaches back to Ancient Rome, and throughout the years blood from several other breeds has been added to the Ardennes, although only the Belgian breed had any significant impact. The first Ardennes were imported to the United States in the early 20th century, and the first breed registry was established in Europe in 1929. The horses have been used throughout history as war horses, both as cavalry mounts and to draw artillery, and are used today mainly for <b>heavy</b> <b>draft</b> and farm work, meat production and competitive driving events. They have also been used to influence or create several other horse breeds throughout Europe and Asia.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1857, Floyd became Secretary of War in {{the cabinet}} of President James Buchanan, where his lack of {{administrative}} ability was soon apparent, including the poor execution of the Utah Expedition. Floyd is implicated in the scandal of the [...] "Abstracted Indian Bonds" [...] which broke {{at the end of}} 1860 as the Buchanan Administration was reaching its end. His wife's nephew Godard Bailey, who worked in the Interior Department and who removed bonds from the Indian Agency safe during 1860, was also implicated. Among the recipients of the money was Russell, Majors, and Waddell, a government contractor that held, among its contracts, the Pony Express. In December 1860, on ascertaining that Floyd had honored <b>heavy</b> <b>drafts</b> made by government contractors in anticipation of their earnings, the president requested his resignation. Several days later Floyd was indicted for malversation in office, although the indictment was overruled in 1861 on technical grounds. There is no proof that he profited by these irregular transactions; in fact, he went out of the office financially embarrassed.|$|R

5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft,</b> the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.|$|E
5|$|The Percheron is {{the most}} famous and populous of all French draft breeds in the world today. They were used to improve both the Ardennes and Vladimir <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft</b> horses, and to create the Spanish-Norman breed, a cross between the Andalusian and the Percheron. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, Percherons made up the {{majority}} of driving horses in Paris. The Percheron is still used extensively for draft work and, like other draft breeds, it is also used in France for meat production. Around the world, Percherons are used for parades, sleigh rides and hayrides, as well as being used to pull carriages in large cities. The largest team of working Percherons in Europe is found at Disneyland Paris, where the breed makes up 30 percent of the horses in the park and the horses work to pull trams on the main park street. One of the most famous horse teams in the United States is the Heinz hitch of Percherons, having appeared multiple times at the Tournament of Roses Parade.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the breed lived in the northern river valleys of the Sambre and the Scheldt, near Valenciennes. Although it is a popular myth that many French draft breeds, including the Trait du Nord, are descendants of the prehistoric horses found at Solutré, this is not true. Two or possibly three subspecies of now-extinct equines have been found at Solutré, {{but there is no}} evidence that they migrated to the area that later produced the Trait du Nord. Like Dutch and Belgian draft breeds such as the Brabant, the origin of the Trait du Nord is found in the large, fertile Flemish grasslands that cover the southern portion of the Netherlands, northern France and all of Belgium. The Hainaut region is the true birthplace of the breed in France. The Belgian draft breeds, the Ardennes and the Trait du Nord share the same ancestry, and the Trait du Nord has a history that is very similar to the Ardennes, due to the influence of the latter breed on the former. The Ardennes, Belgian, Dutch <b>Heavy</b> <b>Draft,</b> Trait du Nord and Auxois are all considered to come from the same group of breeds, due to their heritage, physical characteristics and selection for draft work. Until relatively recently, the breeds were not differentiated, and were frequently crossbred.|$|E
5000|$|Cow Island {{was used}} as a {{steamboat}} landing from about the early 1860s to late 1880s. During this approximately 20-year period, freight was transported to the Montana gold fields by Missouri River steamboat. [...] The destination of the steamboats was Fort Benton at the upper limit of steamboat navigation on the Missouri. In mid to late summer river volumes went into seasonal decline. The river became shallower, and <b>heavier</b> <b>draft</b> steamboats could not pass a series of rapids above Cow Island, specifically the Dauphine Rapids, and thus steamboats could not reach the upriver port of Fort Benton. Steamboats had to offload their freight at a downstream landing in the Missouri Breaks. A common landing site in the breaks was at Cow Island, because the offloaded freight could then be taken overland to Fort Benton using a travel route up Cow Creek. Cow Creek {{was one of the few}} routes by which freight wagons could get from the river, up through the breaks, to the plains. Using Cow Creek as a travel route, freight could be moved overland from Cow Island landing on the river through the Missouri breaks onto the Montana prairie and on to Fort Benton.|$|R
