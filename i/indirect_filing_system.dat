40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and files. In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of files in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> 14. 1 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> <b>system</b> type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> typically, the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework was developed to allow Sun’s distributed computing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> are examples. Network <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that present various abstractions as files in a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> <b>system</b> represents the address space of a process as a series of files. 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> <b>system</b> independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual file, or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> <b>system</b> management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> <b>system</b> by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of Storage Networking, distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that allow data sharing through shared disks will become vital. We refer to Cluster <b>File</b> <b>Systems</b> as a distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> optimized for environments of clustered servers. The requirements such <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> is that they guarantee <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> consistency while allowing shared access from multiple nodes in a shared-disk environment.

40|$|We propose and {{evaluate}} an approach for decoupling persistent-cache management from general <b>file</b> <b>system</b> design. Several distributed <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> maintain a persistent cache {{of data to}} speed up accesses. Most of these <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> retain complete control over various aspects of cache management, such as granularity of caching, and policies for cache placement and eviction. Hardcoding cache management into the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> often results in sub-optimal performance as the clients of the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are prevented from exploiting information about their workload in order to tune cache management. We introduce xCachefs, a framework that allows clients to transparently augment the cache management of the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> and customize the caching policy based on their resources and workload. xCachefs {{can be used to}} cache data persistently from any slow <b>file</b> <b>system</b> to a faster <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> It mounts over two underlying <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> which can be local disk <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> like Ext 2 or remote <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> like NFS. xCachefs maintains the same directory structure as in the source <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> so that disconnected reads are possible when the source <b>file</b> <b>system</b> is down. ...|$|R
