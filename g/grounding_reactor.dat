The work is part of NASA's Advanced Space Exploration Systems Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (NCPS) Project. The goal of the FY 12 - 14 project is to address critical NTP technology challenges and programmatic issues to establish confidence in the affordability and viability of an NTP system. A key enabling technology for an NCPS system is the fabrication of a stable high temperature nuclear fuel form. Although much of the technology was demonstrated during previous programs, there are currently no qualified fuel materials or processes. The work at MSFC is focused on developing critical materials and process technologies for manufacturing robust, full-scale CERMET fuels. Prototypical samples are being fabricated and tested in flowing hot hydrogen to understand processing and performance relationships. As part of this initial demonstration task, a final full scale element test will be performed to validate robust designs. The next phase of the project will focus on continued development and optimization of the fuel materials to enable future ground testing. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a detailed overview of the CERMET fuel materials development plan. The overall CERMET fuel development path is shown in Figure 2.

40|$|Background: Microalgal triacylglycerides (TAGs) are a {{promising}} sustainable feedstock for the biofuel, chemical and food industry. However, industrial production of microalgal products for commodity markets {{is not yet}} economically viable, largely because of low microalgal productivity. The latter is strictly dependent on initial-biomass-specific (IBS) light availability (i. e. ratio of light impinging on <b>reactor</b> <b>ground</b> area divided by initial biomass concentration per ground area). This study investigates the effect of IBS-light availability on batch TAG production for Nannochloropsis sp. cultivated in two outdoor tubular reactors (i. e. vertical and horizontal) at different initial biomass concentrations for the TAG accumulation phase, during two distinct seasons (i. e. high and low light conditions). Results: Increasing IBS-light availability led to both a higher IBS-TAG production rate and TAG content {{at the end of}} the batch, whereas biomass yield on light decreased. As a result, an optimum IBS-light availability was determined for the TAG productivity obtained {{at the end of the}} batch and several guidelines could be established. The vertical reactor (VR) should be operated at an initial biomass concentration of 1. 5 g L - 1 to achieve high TAG productivities (1. 9 and 3. 2 g m - 2 day - 1 under low and high light, respectively). Instead, the horizontal reactor (HR) should be operated at 2. 5 g L - 1 under high light (2. 6 g m - 2 day - 1), and at 1. 5 g L - 1 under low light (1. 4 g m - 2 day - 1). Conclusions: From this study, the great importance of IBS-light availability on TAG production can be deduced. Although maintaining high light availabilities in the reactor is key to reach high TAG contents at the end of the batch, considerable losses in TAG productivity were observed for the two reactors regardless of light condition, when not operated at optimal initial biomass concentrations (15 - 40 % for VR and 30 - 60 % for HR). </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{medium voltage}} network of Finland is {{experiencing}} {{major changes in}} the near future as the overhead lines are replaced with cables. The reason for the extensive cabling is the new suggestions for distribution network operators' quality of supply, which were set by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Cabling sets a number of practical and technical challenges to distribution network operators. From the technical point of view, cables generate a significant amount of reactive power and earth fault current, which were the main research interests of this thesis. The purpose of the thesis was to find an optimal way to compensate both reactive power and earth fault currents in extensively cabled networks. The thesis studied, what is the actual need for compensation and how should it be implemented optimally in a techno-economic way. The study was carried out by using PSCAD-simulation software and making calculations based on the results. The study revealed that there is a certain need for reactive power compensation. The main reason is Fingrid's fee for inputting reactive power in the main grid, which can cause major costs as the amount of cabling increases. Another reason is the power losses due to reactive power flow, which can be effectively limited with the correct selection and placement of shunt reactors. The reactive power compensation should be implemented by using centralized shunt reactors. Distributed shunt reactors {{did not appear to be}} profitable in the normal branched feeders. Instead, they should be used with over 50 ~km straight feeders. The distributed earth fault current compensation should be implemented with distributed Petersén coils. The centralized earth fault compensation should be carried out with a combination of adjustable Petersén coils and centralized shunt reactors. It is possible to use a shunt reactor for earth fault compensation if its neutral point is grounded. However, substations should always first have an adjustable Petersén coil before <b>grounding</b> the shunt <b>reactors</b> in order to keep the correct compensation degree...|$|R
40|$|Fusion {{energy is}} {{attractive}} {{for use in}} future spacecraft because of improved fuel energy density and reduced radioactivity compared with fission power. Unfortunately, the most promising means of generating fusion power on the <b>ground</b> (Tokamak based <b>reactors</b> like ITER and inertial confinement reactors like NIF) require very large and heavy structures for power supplies and magnets, {{in the case of}} magnetic confinement, or capacitors and lasers in the case of inertial confinement. The mass of these reactors and support equipment is sufficiently large that no existing or planned heavy-lift vehicle could launch such a reactor, thereby necessitating in-space construction which would substantially increase the cost of the endeavor. The scaling of Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) is such that high power densities might be achievable in small, light-weight reactors, potentially enabling more rapid, lower cost development of fusion power and propulsion systems for space applications. The primary focus of the research into improving particle and energy confinement in IEC systems is based on the idea of electrostatic ion focusing in a spherically symmetric gridded IEC system. (cont.) Improved ion confinement in this system is achieved by the insertion of multiple concentric grids with appropriately tailored potentials to focus ion beams away from the grid wires. In order to reduce the occurrence of charge exchange and streaming electron power losses, the system is run at high vacuum. This modification to the usual approach was conceived of by Dr. Ray Sedwick and computational modeling has been conducted by Tom McGuire using a variety of custom and commercial codes. In this thesis, a semi-analytic model of the potential structure around a multi-grid IEC device is developed. A 1 -D paraxial ray ion beam envelope approximation is then used along an equatorial beamline and the assumed beam density is gradually increased until an effective beam space charge limit is reached at which point the potential fusion output is calculated. Significant use of the commercial particle-in-cell code OOPIC was made, and its ability to predict multi-grid IEC confinement properties is evaluated. An experiment was built to confirm the effectiveness of the multiple-grid structure to improve ion confinement times. It is shown that the multi-grid IEC can improve ion confinement time over the conventional, 2 -grid IEC device. The PIC predicted ion bunching mode is also seen in experiment. by Carl C. Dietrich.

40|$|Microalgal {{triglycerides}} (TAGs) {{are promising}} feedstocks for the commodity markets (i. e. food, chemical and biofuel). Nevertheless, microalgal TAGs {{are not yet}} economically feasible due to the high production costs. To reduce these costs, TAG productivity needs to be maximized. The aim of this thesis was to increase microalgal TAG productivity by investigating the effects of biological and engineering parameters (i. e. production strain and operational strategy).   We first screened seven marine species on their TAG productivity under nitrogen (N) starvation. Nannochloropsis sp. was identified as the most suitable species as it retained its photosynthetic activity while accumulating large amounts of TAGs ensuring the highest TAG productivity. Therefore, Nannochloropsis sp. was used in all following studies. Next, we aimed at optimizing TAG productivity by investigating the effect of initial-biomass-specific (IBS) light availability (i. e. ratio of light impinging on <b>reactor</b> <b>ground</b> area divided by initial biomass concentration per ground area) in batch outdoor cultivations carried out in horizontal and vertically stacked tubular reactors at different initial biomass concentrations {{at the start of}} the TAG accumulation phase, over different seasons. Based on the observed trends of TAG productivity for the Dutch climate, optimal initial biomass concentrations were suggested to achieve high areal TAG productivities for each reactor configuration and season. Subsequently, repeated-batch processes were investigated to further increase TAG productivity compared to batch processes. For this, repeated-batch cultivations were tested and compared to batch cultivations both at lab-scale under day/night cycles and in two identical, simultaneously operated, outdoor vertically stacked tubular reactors over different seasons. Although at lab-scale, batch and repeated-batch cultivations led to similar TAG productivities, outdoor repeated-batch processes were always outcompeted by the batch. It was concluded that repeated-batch processes require further optimization. For this, the physiological responses of Nannochloropsis sp. to N-starvation and N-replenishment were determined under continuous light in lab-scale batch and repeated-batch cultivations and condensed into a mechanistic model describing both cultivation strategies. Scenarios for improved TAG yields on light were simulated and, based on the optimized yields, a comparison of the two processes was performed. It was concluded that under continuous light, an optimized batch process will always result in higher TAG productivities than an optimized repeated-batch process. Finally, a techno-economic analysis for a two-step-continuous TAG production process (i. e. growth reactors are operated in continuous mode such that multiple batch-operated stress reactors are inoculated and sequentially harvested) is performed for a hypothetical 100 ha-scale plant in southern Spain using vertically stacked tubular reactors. Photosynthetic efficiencies based on outdoor pilot data were used as model input. By optimizing both photosynthetic efficiency and process technology, the production cost could be decreased from 7. 4 to 3. 0 €·kg- 1 of TAG-enriched biomass. We believe to be on the right track to achieve an economically feasible TAG production platform provided that photosynthetic efficiency is further improved, the whole biomass is valorized and cheaper reactors are designed.                                ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{report is}} a study of {{various aspects of the}} relationship between heavy water and the development of the civilian and military uses of atomic energy. It begins with a historical sketch which traces the heavy water storyfrom its discovery by Harold Urey in 1932 through its coming of age from scientific curiosity to strategic nuclear material at the eve of World War II and finally into the post-war period, where the military and civilian strands have some- times seemed inextricably entangled. The report next assesses the nonproliferation implications of the use of heavy water- moderated power reactors; several different reactor types are discussed, but the focus in on the natural uranium, on- power fueled, pressure tube reactor developed in Canada, the CANDU. The need for and development of on-power fueling safe- guards is discussed in some detail. Also considered is the use of heavy water in plutonium production reactors as well as the broader issue of the relative nuclear leverage that suppliers can bring to bear on countries with natural ura- nium-fueled reactors as compared to those using enriched designs. The final chapter reviews heavy water production methods and analyzes the difficulties involved in implemen- ting these on both a large and a small scale. It concludes with an overview of proprietary and nonproliferation constraints on heavy water technology transfer. Our major conclusions are as follows: 1. On-power fueling of CANDU reactors leads to special, well recognized safeguarding problems. These have been addres- sed by a safeguards development program, encompassing both systems analysis and hardware development, jointly sponsored by Atomic Energy of Canada, Ltd. (AECL), the Canadian Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB), and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The approach involves surveillance, containment, and item-counting of irradiated fuel bundles. Although the complete system has not as yet been tested on an operating reactor, {{it appears to be a}} good example of "proliferation resistance engineering. " The major problem may be the political one of obtaining agreement to incorporate the system in operating reactors and those under construction. 2. The question of relative leverage on natural uranium vs. enriched uranium fuel cycles does not have a neat answer. At the moment, most of the countries of proliferation concern have neither large amounts of uranium ore nor the ability to enrich it. (There are, of course, some significant excep- tions, the most obvious being South Africa which has both.) In the near term, the chances of achieving a consensus among current suppliers of separative work, all of whom belong to the London Club, not to supply it in the event of violations of nonproliferation agreements, also seems greater than the prospects of reaching a similar agreement among all countries who might be able to supply uranium ore. If we assume in ad- dition that the malefactor also can produce heavy water [...] no small matter [...] the potential leverage advantage would seem to lie with enriched reactors. On the other hand, the spread of enrichment technology [...] which is easier to rationalize on civil- ian <b>grounds</b> if enriched <b>reactors</b> are in place [...] could tip the scales the other way. In general, however, this weighing of enriched vs. natural uranium fuel cycles is unnecessarily restrictive. Experience has shown that there are many poten- tial levers [...] nuclear and non-nuclear [...] which can be used to persuade countries to adhere to nonproliferation norms. The heart of the matter is the political will to use these in the face of conflicting policy objectives. 3. Unlike uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion and the gas centrifuge, key aspects of which are closely held on nonproliferation grounds, techniques for heavy water produc- tion, particularly by hydrogen sulfide-water exchange (the GS process), have been extensively documented in the open liter- ature. Nevertheless, construction and operation of large plants are difficult, and thus there is good reason to believe that the technology will not spread rapidly through the indig- enous efforts of developing countries. Unlike uranium enrich- ment and fuel reprocessing, heavy water production does not provide a direct route from civilian fuel cycle to weapons- usable materials; on these grounds a logical quid pro quo forits transfer would be adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or acceptance of the principle of full-scope safeguards by the recipient...|$|R
