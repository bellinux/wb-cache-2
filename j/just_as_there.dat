5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; {{there is no such thing}} as a collective clan crest, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is no such thing as a clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle further {{noted that}} there are many bird forms within the bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are many forms of fishes within the fish kind. He {{sometimes}} called these atomon eidos, indivisible forms. Human is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E

5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is a {{need for}} tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

The lunar year with eleven months is very rare. It occurs once in 140 years or once in 190 years.|$|E
25|$|There is {{disagreement}} over {{the degree of}} influence that Husserl had on Heidegger's philosophical development, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is disagreement about {{the degree to which}} Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in phenomenology. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> {{are various}} types of manifolds, there are {{various types of}} maps of manifolds. In {{addition}} to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings, of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions, submersions, covering spaces, and ramified covering spaces.|$|E

But some implausibility comes with the horror/suspense genre, and there's no question Kevin Williamson has mastered it — <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there's</b> {{no question that the}} match of wills between the wounded Kevin Bacon and malevolent James Purefoy is exceedingly well played." ...|$|R

25|$|Historians in {{the early}} 20th century, such as J. Franklin Jameson, {{examined}} the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution. In the last 50years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead {{the high level of}} ideological unity. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army.|$|E
25|$|Mīmāṃsā {{philosophers}} {{argue that}} {{there was no need to}} postulate a maker for the world, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals. Mīmāṃsā argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{made with}} the {{secretion}} of the parotid gland of Rhabdophis and Zamenis have shown that even aglyphous snakes are not entirely devoid of venom, and point {{to the conclusion that}} the physiological difference between so-called harmless and venomous snakes is only one of degree, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are various steps in the transformation of an ordinary parotid gland into a venom gland or of a solid tooth into a tubular or grooved fang.|$|E

25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was {{difference}} in eating habits, {{a range of}} religious affiliations existed among the North American Phalanx's resident members. Included among the community's ranks were Unitarians, Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, Episcopalians, Jews, Shakers, as well as agnostics and atheists. While religious matters were frequently the object of discussion and debate, heated division over religious topics {{does not seem to}} have occurred in the community until 1853, with the climate sharpening as the end of the institution approached.|$|E
25|$|I do {{not think}} that this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{may also}} be {{purchased}} through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the first}} major defeats of the Ottoman Empire reduced the {{perceived}} threat in European minds, which led to an artistic craze for Turkish things. There was a fashion for Turkish things with Turquerie, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> was a fashion for Chinese things with Chinoiserie, both of which became constitutive components of the Rococo style. Orientalism started to become hugely popular, first with the works of Jean-Baptiste van Mour, who had accompanied the embassy of Charles de Ferriol to Constantinople 1699 and stayed there until {{the end of his life}} in 1737, and later with the works of Boucher or Fragonard.|$|E
25|$|It {{is quite}} common for {{saturation}} divers to need to work over a range of depths while the saturation system can only maintain one or two storage depths at any given time. A change of depth from storage depth is known as an excursion, and divers can make excursions within limits without incurring a decompression obligation, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are no-decompression limits for surface oriented diving. Excursions may be upward or downward from the storage depth, and the allowed depth change may be the same in both directions, or sometimes slightly less upward than downward. Excursion limits are generally based on a 6 to 8 hour time limit, as this is the standard time limit for a diving shift.|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> were Portuguese {{communities}} in the cities of northern Europe, there were colonies of merchants {{from the rest of}} Europe in Lisbon, then {{one of the most important}} cities in international trade. Not counting the Jewish population (already established as a Portuguese minority), the Genoese were the most numerous expatriate community, followed by those of the Venetians and other Italians, and the Dutch and English. These merchants brought new cartographic and navigational techniques to Portugal, as well as an understanding of financial and banking practices and of the mercantilism system, not to mention the knowledge gained through their contacts with Byzantine and Muslim middlemen of the origins of imported Asian luxury goods such as silks and spices.|$|E
