5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of <b>Indians</b> <b>as</b> symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans, the Japanese, and, later, the <b>Indians,</b> <b>as</b> these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in western Asia in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for <b>Indians.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after being threatened, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2017, Fister was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox.

On an August 22 start in Cleveland, Fister allowed a lead off home run to Francisco Lindor to briefly tie the score at 1-1, but this {{would turn out to}} be the only hit registered by the <b>Indians</b> <b>as</b> Fister would go on to pitch a complete game 1-hitter and not allow a hit to the final 28 batters faced in the game in an eventual 9-1 Red Sox win.|$|E
5|$|The {{death toll}} of the Bersiap period {{runs into the}} tens of thousands. The bodies of 3,600 Indo-Europeans have been {{identified}} as killed. However more than 20,000 registered Indo-European civilians were abducted and never returned. The Indonesian revolutionaries lost at least 20,000, often young, fighting men. Estimates of the number of Indonesian fighters killed in the lead up and during the Battle of Surabaya range from 6,300 to 15,000. The Japanese forces lost around 1,000 soldiers and the British forces registered 660 soldiers, mostly British <b>Indians,</b> <b>as</b> killed (with a similar number missing in action). The actual Dutch military were hardly involved, as they only started to return to Indonesia in March and April 1946.|$|E

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American <b>Indians</b> <b>as</b> they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and <b>Indians</b> <b>as</b> far north as present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area {{to assist in the}} construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of aggression is seen {{as one of the first}} military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E
