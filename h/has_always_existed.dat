25|$|The {{concept and}} {{punishment}} of Apostasy {{has been extensively}} covered in Islamic literature since the 7th century. A person is considered apostate {{if he or she}} converts from Islam to another religion. A person is an apostate even if he or she believes in most of Islam, but verbally or in writing denies of one or more principles or precepts of Islam. For example, if a Muslim declares that the universe <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed,</b> he or she is an apostate; similarly, a Muslim who doubts the existence of Allah, enters a church or temple, makes offerings to and worships an idol or stupa or any image of God, celebrates festivals of non-Muslim religion, helps build a church or temple, confesses a belief in rebirth or incarnation of God, disrespects Qur'an or Islam's Prophet are all individually sufficient evidence of apostasy.|$|E

500|$|The Utility of Force was broadly {{praised by}} reviewers {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. It was {{compared}} favourably with Carl von Clausewitz's treatise On War and American reviewers felt that it contained important lessons for the United States military. Smith was criticised for over-emphasising the paradigm shift, with several reviewers observing that conventional wars are still fought and that the threat of such wars still exists, and for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and conventional war, particularly with his opening sentence [...] "war no longer exists". Reviewers also felt that Smith under-emphasised the extent to which [...] "war amongst the people" [...] <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed.</b> Nonetheless, reviewers praised Smith's analysis of modern war and recommended that The Utility of Force ought to be read by politicians and military officers.|$|E

It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, Girls Will Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and learned a lesson in diversity.… They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed</b> but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
500|$|The title song, [...] "Tupelo Honey", is {{a classic}} love ballad in a vein {{established}} with [...] "Crazy Love" [...] from the album Moondance. The two songs both have the same melody, chord progression and are in 4/4 time. [...] Uncut reviewer David Cavanagh wrote that: [...] "On an album where the vocals are exultant to say the least, this song sees Morrison use larynx, diaphragm, teeth and tongue {{to find new ways}} of enunciating the lines 'she's as sweet as Tupelo honey' and 'she's all right with me', seemingly in ever-increasing adoration." [...] Bob Dylan (who performed the song with Morrison during a concert tour in the 1990s) once remarked that [...] "'Tupelo Honey' <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed</b> and that Morrison was merely the vessel and the earthly vehicle for it". Greil Marcus called the song [...] "a kind of odyssey" [...] evoking Elvis Presley (whose hometown was Tupelo, Mississippi), and [...] "the most gorgeous number on the album" [...] that [...] "was too good not to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fundamental}} idea of [...] "restoration" [...] or [...] "Christian Primitivism" [...] is that problems or {{deficiencies in the}} church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a [...] "normative model." [...] The call for restoration is often justified {{on the basis of}} a [...] "falling away" [...] that corrupted the original purity of the church. [...] This falling away is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism. [...] New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy (...) and heresy (e.g., , , [...] ) are understood to predict this falling away. [...] The logic of [...] "restoration" [...] could imply that the [...] "true" [...] church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism. [...] Another view of restoration is that the [...] "true Church ... <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed</b> by grace and not by human engineering" [...] (italics in the original). [...] In this view the goal is to [...] "help Christians realize the ideal of the church in the New Testament– to restore the church as conceived in the mind of Christ" [...] (italics in the original). [...] Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist, but instead sought to reform and reunite the church. [...] A number of congregations' web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared. [...] The belief in a general falling away is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared. Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Army of Me", a song [...] "so menacing and inorganic-sounding" [...] that, {{according}} to The New York Times, it verges on industrial rock. It is an aggressive technopop song with elements of trip hop. Dedicated to the singer's younger brother, the song's lyrics are, according to Björk herself, [...] "about telling {{someone who is}} full of self-pity and doesn't have anything together to get a life and stand up"; as she sings: [...] "And if you complain once more/You'll meet an army of me!" [...] "Hyperballad", which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, {{has been described as}} [...] "a love song penned by Aphex Twin". NME wrote that its music [...] "altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house"; an attempt to reflect the song's lyrics, which are about [...] "the art of not forgetting about yourself". In them, Björk describes living {{at the top of a}} mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. [...] "Hyperballad" [...] is followed by [...] "The Modern Things", a song that, in a magical realist tone, [...] "playfully posits the theory that technology <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed,</b> waiting in mountains for humans to catch up". Interview described it in 1995 as a [...] "spooky tune", noting [...] "the odd scratchings at the end" [...] of the track. In his 2000 book Jung and the Postmodern: The Interpretation of Realities, Christopher Hauke described this effect at the end as [...] "when a record player has reached the end of an analogue, vinyl record and the needle is stuck as the disc continues going round"; and considered this [...] "trick" [...] to be a case of postmodernism, serving as an example of [...] "the relationship between the present and past that pushes conceptualising even further by the inclusion of modern technology and its ambivalent relationship with previous forms." [...] In a startling shift in style, the big band track [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as [...] "a palate-cleanser during the course of the record". The last song recorded for Post, Björk has said she decided to include it, [...] "just to make it absolutely certain that the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock".|$|E

The United States Department of State states that the war [...] "resulted in the death of over 4,200 American and over 20,000 Filipino combatants", and that [...] "as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians died from violence, famine, and disease".. The history of the war continues to color US-Philippine relations to the present: [...] "Anti-Americanism <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>existed</b> among the Filipinos as many do know the history of the U.S. invasion and the genocide that followed during the Philippine–American War." ...|$|E

Smith, a University of Virginia and Harvard alumnus who began his career at ENC, is widely considered the first evangelical Christian to gain academic prominence, while ENC alumnus and physicist Karl Giberson has worked to address the Creation-Evolution controversy and was Executive Vice President of the BioLogos Foundation until May 2011. Though it makes no religious requirements of its students, Eastern Nazarene has required that its faculty members be Christian since 1993. The school currently has three college divisions: the Traditional Undergraduate Division, the Adult Studies Division (often called the Leadership Education for Adults Division, or LEAD), and the Graduate Division. There were 1,075 students enrolled at the college in 2007, 927 of whom were undergraduate and 148 of whom were graduate students.
