25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis is {{a common}} species of <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> that appear {{worldwide}} in distribution and is commonly found in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The species Phormia regina, more {{commonly}} known as the black blow fly, belongs to the blow fly family Calliphoridae. Although some authorities merge both the blow fly group (Calliphoridae) and the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> group (Sarcophagidae) together in the family Metopiidae, key distinguishable physical traits allow for this separation.|$|E
25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis, {{also known}} as the red-tailed <b>flesh</b> <b>fly,</b> is a fly in the Sarcophagidae family. This fly often breeds in carrion and feces, making it a {{possible}} vector for disease. The larvae of this species can cause myiasis, as well as accidental myiasis. It is potentially useful in forensic entomology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> {{can carry}} leprosy bacilli and can {{transmit}} intestinal pseudomyiasis {{to people who}} eat their larvae. <b>Flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> particularly Wohlfahrtia magnifica, can also cause myiasis in animals, mostly to sheep, and can give them blood poisoning, or asymptomatic leprosy infections.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> {{fall under}} the family Sacrophagidae and {{generally}} arrive to a corpse following Calliphoridae. However, as previously mentioned {{they are capable of}} flying in the rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae overall effecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. <b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|R
50|$|The flowers have {{a variety}} of insect pollinators, {{including}} honey bees, carpenter bees, halictid bees, plasterer bees, sphecid wasps, vespid wasps, butterflies, moths, beetles, hoverflies, tachinid <b>flies,</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> blow flies, and muscid flies.|$|R
25|$|Sarcophagidae larvae {{are white}} or pale yellow, cylindrical, and tapered anteriorly. All {{segments}} beyond the first have anterior and posterior bands of hairs. The mandibles are usually strong and curved, resembling a hook. Posterior spiracles are sunken in, {{which is a}} characteristic {{that can be used}} to distinguish between <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> and blow fly larvae. Larvae are most often found in decaying animal matter.|$|E
25|$|Present on the thorax {{are three}} {{contrasting}} black and grey longitudinal stripes; these stripes do not continue onto the abdomen. Sarcophaga have 4, {{rather than the}} normal 2 or 3, notopleural bristles, and 3 sternopleural bristles. A prominent row of black bristles (setae) {{can be found on}} each side of the thorax, just above the base of the hind leg and just under the base of the wing. These two sets of bristles are what differentiate Sarcophagidae from Muscidae. S. bullata lacks the postscutellum, the large swelling underneath the scutellum of the thorax, which distinguishes the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> from Tachinid. S. bullata have black legs, translucent wings, and do not have a costal spine.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study was}} {{conducted}} concerning an effect by the mothers of the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> population. [...] There is a maternal effect that operates in S. bullata that can prevent pupal diapause when reared under short day conditions. It was determined that certain environmental stressors or chemical treatments on the mother, such as extreme temperature shocks, food deprivation and reducing maternal size, were ineffective in altering the diapause-suppressant. However, there were several chemical agents that proved effective. Gamma-aminobutyric acid, octopamine and pilocarpine all countered the maternal affect and permitted the expression of diapause in the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> progeny. [...] The ability to express diapause is an important consideration for forensic entomologists as diapause allows the pupae to become metabollically [...] "dormant" [...] until environmental conditions improve; this would significantly affect pupal time estimations and subsequent post-mortem interval estimations.|$|E

2500|$|Following Fay's sentence, {{the case}} {{received}} wide coverage by the American and international media. The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times ran editorials and op-eds condemning the punishment. USA Today reported that caning involved [...] "bits of <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> with each stroke." [...] This latter detail was apparently taken from descriptions (originally {{derived from a}} 1974 press conference) {{of a much larger}} number of strokes, for more severe crimes such as rape and robbery.|$|E
2500|$|Sarcophaga bullata, or {{the grey}} <b>flesh</b> <b>fly,</b> is {{a species of}} fly {{belonging}} to the family Sarcophagidae. It varies in size from small to large, 8 to 17 millimeters in length and is very similar in appearance and behavior to a closely related species, Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis. S. bullata is a common scavenger species in the Eastern United States, but is found throughout the Nearctic region. Identification down to the species level in the Sarcophagidae family is notably difficult and relies primarily on the male genitalia. Though limited information is available regarding S. bullata, it has gained increasing recognition {{in the field of}} forensic entomology as a forensically-relevant fly species, as it may be among the first species to colonize human remains. [...] In these instances, recovered maggots may be analyzed for post-mortem interval (PMI) estimations, which may be used as evidence in courts of law. Current studies regarding S. bullata have revealed a maternal effect operating in these flies that prevents pupal diapause under certain environmental conditions, which is an important factor to be considered during forensic analyses.|$|E
2500|$|Synthesiomyia nudiseta is {{a species}} that {{is found to be}} quite necrophilous. Like other Muscidae species, it prefers to {{surround}} itself in a wide range from garbage to human and animal remains. S. nudiseta will pupate slowly and in a restricted environment, and prefer not to migrate far away from the resource. [...] Therefore, in stages of decomposition of forensic importance it is essential to verify all areas in close proximity to the corpse. Pupa have typically been found in victims’ clothing in places such as the elastic waistbands of pants, the inner surfaces of the victim’s clothing, and even in the space in between the body and the ground. In the life cycle during stages of decomposition, S. nudiseta will be inclined to pupate with other species of flies when they arrive later in different waves. Depending on where S. nudiseta happens to be located geographically can affect how delayed the fly will take to pupate. For instance, in Hawaii, S. nudiseta is apt to feed on carrion as a food source and pupation invades similar to the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> genus Sarcophaga, which is the second general decomposition wave.|$|E

25|$|<b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> – Family Sarcophagidae- Most <b>flesh</b> <b>flies</b> {{breed in}} carrion, dung, garbage, or {{decaying}} material, {{but a few}} species lay their eggs in the open wounds of mammals; hence their common name. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Most holarctic Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the thorax and checkering on the abdomen. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on corpses of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).|$|R
50|$|Flowers are pollinated by {{a variety}} of bees, {{including}} little carpenter bees, cuckoo bees, halictine bees, and masked bees, as well as flies, including syrphid flies, bee <b>flies,</b> tachinid <b>flies,</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> anthomyiid flies, and muscid flies. Wasps, small butterflies, and other insects also visit the flowers to a lesser degree, seeking nectar, as well as a few pollen-feeding beetles.|$|R
5|$|The {{eggs and}} nymphs are {{under attack by}} parasitoids {{including}} blow <b>flies,</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites.

25|$|Sarcophagidae is the {{dipteran}} family {{commonly known}} as <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> comprising approximately 2000 species. Many species of Sarcophagidae prefer to breed in carrion over other mediums, but there are several species that breed in dung. A large number of species are parasitoids or cleptoparasitoids and never breed in carrion. It is difficult to identify the S. haemorrhoidalis species unless genitalia can be observed. Only males can be identified and classified within the genus. Sarcophagids are rather large in size ranging from 4 to 23mm, (adults of S. haemorrhoidalis vary in size from 7 to 14mm). Distinguishing characteristics include a checkerboard like pattern on the abdomen, stripes on the thorax and red eyes. <b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> are attracted to anything rotting, including feces. Sarcophagidae are unimpeded by rain and fly in any weather. Because of this trait, Sarcophagidae will often be the first flies to colonize a corpse after {{an extended period of}} rain. <b>Flesh</b> <b>flies</b> appear to prefer sunlight over shaded conditions. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) is the {{one of the most common}} species of Sarcophagidae recovered from indoor crime scenes in the United States.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of female <b>flesh</b> <b>flies</b> was always considered {{a difficult task}} since morphological descriptions and keys for females are rare. Even in a forensic entomology framework, where females play a major role, female <b>flesh</b> <b>flies</b> are usually not identified. In order to fill this gap in Southern Brazil fauna we provide detailed descriptions and key for the female of nine species included in four genera: Microcerella halli (Engel), Oxysarcodexia paulistanensis (Mattos), Oxysarcodexia riograndensis (Lopes), Peckia (Euboettcheria) australis (Townsend), Peckia (Euboettcheria) florencioi (Prado and Fonseca), Peckia (Pattonella) intermutans (Walker), Peckia (Pattonella) resona (Lopes), Peckia (Sarcodexia) lambens (Wiedemann), and Sarcophaga (Bercaea) africa (Wiedemann). These species are distinguished mainly by genital characters as tergite 6 divided or undivided, presence of tergite 8, spermatheca morphology and vaginal plate shape...|$|R

The diet of the <b>flesh</b> <b>fly</b> is very high in water content. The fly regurgitates the liquid portion of the food, holds it while evaporation reduces the water content and the fly then swallows a much more concentrated meal without the water content.

5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as parrotfish and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by <b>flesh</b> <b>flies,</b> feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|R
