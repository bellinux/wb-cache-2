50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>sharks</b> are light-bodied {{with long}} {{pectoral}} fins. Like many other <b>sharks,</b> <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> are countershaded: {{the top of}} the body is deep blue, lighter on the sides, and the underside is white. The male <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> commonly grows to 1.82 to 2.82 m at maturity, whereas the larger females commonly grow to 2.2 to 3.3 m at maturity. Large specimens can grow to 3.8 m long. Occasionally, an outsized <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> is reported, with one widely printed claim of a length of 6.1 m, but no shark even approaching this size has been scientifically documented. The <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> is fairly elongated and slender in build and typically weighs from 27 to 55 kg in males and from 93 to 182 kg in large females. Occasionally, a female in excess of 3 m will weigh over 204 kg. The heaviest reported weight for the species was 391 kg. The <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> is also ectothermic and it has a unique sense of smell.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{like most}} pelagic sharks, tend to fare poorly in captivity. Attempts at keeping them using {{circular}} tanks with long glide paths, and pools with 3 m central depth gently ascending to zero depth {{have met with}} mixed results at best; most specimens last fewer than 30 days. As with other pelagic sharks, {{they seem to have}} trouble avoiding walls or other obstacles. In 1969, at Sea World San Diego, several <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> were put in circular tanks (15 m diameter, 2.1 m deep) for three months. The <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> did fairly well until bull sharks were added to the tank; the bull <b>sharks</b> ate the <b>blue</b> <b>sharks.</b> The captivity record for <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> as of 2008 was held by the New Jersey Aquarium for a specimen that lasted roughly seven months before expiring of an apparent bacterial infection.|$|R

40|$|This project {{provided}} an exceptional opportunity to describe diving behaviour, movements and to characterise critical habitats of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> in the North-eastern Atlantic using satellite and archival telemetry.   Tracked <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> displayed southward movements {{away from the}} tagging areas, exhibiting pronounced site fidelity to localised high-productivity frontal regions.   <b>Blue</b> <b>sharks</b> also displayed {{a high degree of}} variability in vertical movements. Shifts in diving behaviour were detected both within and between individuals, whereas behavioural phases were linked to the thermal structure of the water column in coastal areas, and to changes in prey distribution or type in offshore regions.   High resolution data showed that <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> shift between Brownian (in productive habitats) and Lévy (less productive waters) behaviours.   Vertical movements ranged from the surface to 1160 m, and water temperatures varied between 7. 2 - 27. 2 °C.   Behavioural data was also crucial in determining the degree of spatial and temporal overlap, and thus vulnerability, between <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> and high-seas longliners.   Confirmed fishing mortality was ~ 11 % with four tagged sharks caught by surface longliners.   Simulations showed that boats/sharks overlap was higher in winter and early spring, with the majority of simulated sharks (~ 88 %) at risk at least one day year- 1.   Our results indicate that, depending on which geographical regions are occupied at specific times, different segments of the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> population face differential risk from longlines.   Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA suggested an absence of spatial genetic differentiation throughout the North Atlantic, providing strong evidence that <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> comprise a single population in this region.

40|$|The {{nominal catch}} of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> in the Canadian Atlantic grossly {{underestimates}} the actual catch mortality; {{the sum of}} landed catch and by-catch mortality in the Canadian Atlantic has averaged about 1000 t annually since 1986. Several indices of population health suggest that <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> abundance has declined, and mortality has increased, in the past decade. Median size in the catch has declined, as have standardized catch rates from both commercial longline fisheries and recreational shark tournaments. Catch curve analysis suggests a very high fishing mortality on the population. However, Petersen analysis of tag recaptures indicates that the exploitation rate in Canadian waters was < 1 %. Two independent approximations of total North Atlantic <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> catch mortality suggest North Atlantic catches of more than 100, 000 t and catch mortalities of 26, 000 - 37, 000 t. <b>Blue</b> <b>sharks</b> have low commercial value and are discarded in great numbers by commercial pelagic fisheries.

40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca) {{is among}} the most {{abundant}} and widely distributed of all oceanic elasmobranchs. Millions of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> are caught annually worldwide in pelagic long line fisheries, and it accounts for the largest component of auctioned fin weight in the international shark fin trade. There is growing concern about the depletion of its populations worldwide and impacts of such large scale removal of an apex predator on oceanic ecosystem stability. The fragmentary nature of life history information available for <b>blue</b> <b>sharks,</b> including on its detailed movement and migratory behavior, continues to limit management efforts that require such data for stock assessment and sustainable catch modeling. To assist in obtaining a better understanding of <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> movement behavior in the western north Atlantic, I used satellite telemetry to investigate the detailed habitat utilization and movements of sharks during the summer months when the sharks form aggregations on the continental shelf off the Northeast United States, and during their fall, pelagic migrations.

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to conduct a}} stock assessment for the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca) in the North Atlantic have been handicapped {{by the lack of}} reliable catch and effort data. The use of tag-recapture data is among ICCAT’s recommendations for future assessment work. This paper proposes a statistical framework for estimating <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> movement and fishing mortality rates from the tag-recapture data of the National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program (NMFS-CSTP). The model considers four geographical regions. <b>Blue</b> <b>sharks</b> can stay in the region in which they were tagged and they can move among regions. The parameters of the model are the intra- and inter-region movement probabilities and the catchability coefficients that relate the probabilities of capture and the ICCAT longline fishing effort data. Bayesian estimation methods are used to estimate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the values for these parameters. The dataset of the NMFS-CSTP shows potential for use in a <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> stock assessment and should be investigated further. Areas of interest for future research are identified.

40|$|Dramatic {{population}} declines among {{species of}} pelagic shark {{as a result}} of overfishing have been reported, with some species now at a fraction of their historical biomass. Advanced telemetry techniques enable tracking of spatial dynamics and behaviour, providing fundamental information on habitat preferences of threatened species to aid conservation. We tracked movements of the highest pelagic fisheries by-catch species, the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> Prionace glauca, in the North-east Atlantic using pop-off satellite-linked archival tags to determine the degree of space use linked to habitat and to examine vertical niche. Overall, <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> moved south-west of tagging sites (English Channel; southern Portugal), exhibiting pronounced site fidelity correlated with localized productive frontal areas, with estimated space-use patterns being significantly different from that of random walks. Tracked female sharks displayed behavioural variability in diel depth preferences, both within and between individuals. Diel depth use ranged from normal DVM (nDVM; dawn descent, dusk ascent), to reverse DVM (rDVM; dawn ascent, dusk descent), to behavioural patterns where no diel differences were apparent. Results showed that <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> occupy some of the most productive marine zones for extended periods and structure diel activity patterns across multiple spatio-temporal scales in response to particular habitat types. In so doing, sharks occupied an extraordinarily broad vertical depth range for their size (1. 0 - 2. 0 m fork length), from the surface into the bathypelagic realm (max. dive depth, 1160 m). The space-use patterns of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> indicated they spend much of the time in areas where pelagic longlining activities are often highest, and in depth zones where these fisheries particularly target other species, which could account for the rapid declines recently reported for <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> {{in many parts of the}} world's oceans.

40|$|At-haulback {{mortality}} of <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca) {{captured by the}} Portuguese pelagic longline fish- ery targeting swordfish in the Atlantic was modeled. Data was collected by onboard fishery observers that monitored 762 fishing sets (1 005 486 hooks) and recorded information on 26 383 <b>blue</b> <b>sharks.</b> The sample size distribution ranged from 40 to 305 cm fork length, with 13. 3 % of the specimens captured dead at-haulback. Data modeling was carried out with Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Gener- alized Estimation Equations (GEE), given the fishery-dependent source of the data. The explanatory variables influencing <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> mortality rates were year, specimen size, fishing location, sex, season and branch line material.

One important conclusion {{of this study was}} that <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> sizes are important predictors for estimating at-haulback mortality rates, with the probabilities of dying at-haulback decreasing with increasing specimen sizes.

40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} large, pelagic shark inhabiting upper oceanic waters. Because of its widespread distribution and relatively high fecundity, the <b>blue</b> <b>shark</b> has been depicted by some as being more resistant to the impacts of fishing pressure than other shark species. To test this hypothesis, we investigated historical trends in the abundance of <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> in the western North Atlantic during {{a period in which}} commercial and recreational catches of pelagic sharks were substantial. We used catch and effort data from the R. V. Geronimo, a fishery-independent longliner that operated consistently in the summer months from 1977 to 1994 in US continental shelf waters south of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York. The catches included juveniles and adults of both sexes, but very few adult females. When catch per unit of effort was analyzed using a generalized linear model, male <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> showed an approximately 80 % decline between the mid- 1980 s and the early 1990 s. A significant change in female catch rates could not be demonstrated primarily because of the lower numbers of females in the catch. These results suggest that a dramatic decline occurred in the abundance of male <b>blue</b> <b>sharks</b> inhabiting a portion of the western North Atlantic.
