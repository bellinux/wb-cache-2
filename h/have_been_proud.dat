25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud.</b> Haggard {{says he knows}} nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies {{and goes on to}} say that some evangelicals think of his services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of the fourth day's play, though India had no chance of winning anything, they dished up a {{performance}} they could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of. To summarize the events that happened on that day, India closed at 362/6 from 105 overs, with VVS Laxman and the Indian Captain Sourav Ganguly helping themselves to some runs. Laxman scored 75 runs from 113 balls with 11 boundaries, while Sourav Ganguly played the innings that defined the test match and made the day memorable for one and all. He scored 144 runs from just 196 balls laced with 18 shots to the ropes.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{performed}} [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] {{live for}} the first time on June 24, 2011 at the NBC's Today Show as he danced along with his band. The choreography was inspired by James Brown, and Mars picked up a megaphone to sing some of the lyrics. On October 22, 2011, Mars and his band wore matching red velvet Dolce & Gabbana suits during the song's performance on the results show of The X Factor UK. Robbie Daw of Idolator called the live show [...] "rowdy", while a writer for Rap-Up praised the performance, writing that it [...] "rocked the house" [...] due to his [...] "James Brown funky moves" [...] and singing into a megaphone. Christopher Hooton for Metro opined that Mars [...] "stole the show" [...] with his suit and [...] "dance moves James Brown himself would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of." ...|$|E

500|$|While in camp in Falmouth in late November, the {{officers}} of the 29th learned that Meagher had arranged for a green Irish Brigade flag to {{be presented to the}} regiment, recognizing their role as [...] "honorary Irishmen" [...] and their bravery during the Battle of Antietam. [...] Barnes declined the gift, however. [...] According to the regimental historian, [...] "While the Colonel would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to receive the flag for the regiment as a token of the respect of their Irish comrades, yet he objected to the flag being carried by the regiment, on the ground that it was not an Irish regiment." [...] Irish Brigade historians, including Joseph Bilby, have observed {{that there may have been}} some controversy surrounding the issue. [...] According to Bilby, Barnes refused to accept the flag because they believed it [...] "would brand them as Fenians," [...] or Irish revolutionaries.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, Grainger's main {{legacy is}} {{the revival of}} {{interest}} in folk music. His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folk songs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect. After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten [...] declared that these [...] " [...] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked hat". In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music; Timothy Reynish, a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him as [...] "the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras." [...] Grainger's attempts to produce [...] "free music" [...] by mechanical and later electronic means, which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were quickly overtaken and nullified [...] by new technological advances. Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness and ingenious [...] use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer's character – one of which Grainger would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The year 1752 brought {{another major}} {{commission}} to Gluck, {{when he was}} asked to set Metastasio's La clemenza di Tito (the specific libretto was the composer's choice) for the nameday celebrations of King Charles VII of Naples (later Charles III of Spain). The opera was performed on 4 November at the Teatro di San Carlo, and the world-famous mezzo-soprano castrato Caffarelli (Gaetano Majorano) took the role of Sextus. For Caffarelli Gluck composed the famous, but notoriously difficult, aria [...] "Se mai senti spirarti sul volto," [...] which provoked admiration and vituperation in equally large measures. Gluck later reworked this aria for his Iphigénie en Tauride. According to one account, the Neapolitan composer Francesco Durante claimed that his fellow composers [...] "should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to have conceived and written [...]" [...] Durante simultaneously declined to comment {{whether or not it was}} within the boundaries of the accepted compositional rules of the time.|$|E
2500|$|One of Moulton's most appreciative, scholastic, and discriminating critics was Professor John Meiklejohn. He {{has said}} with {{authority}} that she {{deserved to be}} classed with the best Elizabethan lyricists in her lyrics,—with Robert Herrick and Thomas Campion and Shakespeare,—while in her sonnets she might rightly take a place with John Milton and William Wordsworth and Christina Rossetti. [...] "I cannot tell you how keen and great enjoyment (sometimes even rapture)," [...] he wrote her, [...] "I have got out of your exquisite lyrics." [...] In a series of [...] "Notes," [...] following the poems, line by line, he asserted that the poet won her success by the simplest means and plainest words, as true genius always does, and that her pages were full of emotional and imaginative meaning, Nature and Poetry uniting in an indissoluble whole; and Shelley himself, he said, would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to own certain of the lines. The poem [...] "Quest" [...] he found so beautiful that, in his own words, it was [...] "difficult to speak of it in perfectly measured and unexaggerated language." [...] Of the poem [...] "Wife to Husband" [...] he said that [...] "the tenderness, the sweet and compelling rhythm, are worthy of the best Elizabethan days." [...] The sonnet, [...] "A Summer's Growth," [...] "unites," [...] he says, the [...] "passion of such Italian poets as Dante with the imagination of modern English." [...] This was in relation to her first volume, [...] "Swallow Flights"; and in conclusion he said: [...] "This poet must look for her brothers in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries among the noble and intense lyrists. Her insight, her subtlety, her delicacy, her music, are hardly matched, and certainly not surpassed by Herrick or Campion or Crashaw or Carew or Herbert or Vaughan." ...|$|E
