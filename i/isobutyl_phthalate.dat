40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to carry out phytochemical investigation of the ethanolic extract of the stem bark of Terminalia tomentosa Roxb (ex DC) Wight & Arnbelonging to the family Combreteaceae. The plant is known in Sanskrit as Asana, in English as Black murdah, in Hindi as Asan, Saj, Sain and in Marathi as Ain. The plant {{has been known to}} possess various pharmacological activities like antifungal, antioxidant, antihyperglycaemic, antidiarrhoeal, antileucorrheal etc. The bark of the plant is astringent & useful in ulcers, vata, fractures, haemorrhages, bronchitis, diarrhoea etc. Preliminary phytochemical screening of the ethanolic extract of stem bark revealed the presence of carbohydrates, flavonoids, triterpenoids,steroids, tannins and saponins. The chemical entities isolated and characterised includes 4 – methy l- 4 -hydroxymethylene- 6 β- (10 - methyl octanyl) cyclohexane (Arjuna homoses quiterpenol), di-n-octyl phthalate, di <b>isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and dibutyl phthalate. All these phytoconstituents are reported for the first time from the ethanolic extract of stem bark of T. tomentosa...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{essential}} oil obtained by hydrodistillation of {{the seed of}} Trachyspermum ammi (Umbelliferae), growing wild in Sabzevar, Khorasan Razavi province (Iran), were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The yield of total volatiles was 2. 3 % (w/w). Forty four compounds representing 91. 6 % of the aerial parts oil were identified.   The main components of the oil were Hexadecanoic acid (27. 5 %), ethyl linoleate (8. 5 %), 6 -methyl-α-ionone (8. 0 %), <b>isobutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (5. 8 %), α-cadinol (4. 7 %), germacrene D (4. 3 %) and δ-cadinene (3. 5 %). The oil was rich in nonterpenoids (56. 0 %). The total flavonoid content of different extracts of the plant {{was found to be}} in the range 53. 2 - 164. 5 mg/g while the maximum amount concern to methanol extract. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was also measured by radical scavenging activity of antioxidants against free radical 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. Results showed that IC 50 of the extracts of Trachyspermum ammi seed are higher than the standard synthetic antioxidants, BHT, ascorbic acid and gallic acid...|$|E
