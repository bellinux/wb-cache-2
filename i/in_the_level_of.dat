40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} effects of 2 regimens of hormone {{replacement}} therapy during the postmenopausal period on {{the profile of the}} major lipoprotein subfractions (HDL, LDL, and VLDL). METHODS: We carried out a cohort study in 38 postmenopausal patients who were starting their hormone replacement therapy due to gynecological indications, for a period of 12 weeks. Analysis of lipoprotein subclasses was performed through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: Hormone replacement therapy cause an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger subfractions of VLDL and HDL (p= 0. 008 and 0. 03, respectively) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger particles of VLDL due to a 36 % increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> larger particles (p= 0. 004), concomitantly with a 15 % reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> smaller particles (p= 0. 04).

No significant change occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution pattern of LDL subfractions. CONCLUSION: The proportion of larger subfractions of VLDL and HDL increases after hormone replacement therapy. <b>The</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proportion of larger particles of VLDL occurs due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger subclasses concomitantly with a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smaller particles.

5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests.

5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} Karma which {{is affected by the}} decisions and actions the character performs during the game.

Karma can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or give off unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific Karma level.
