In general, different phases have different charge affinities, so that an electrical double layer forms at any interface. Small particle sizes lead to enormous surface areas, and this effect is greatly amplified in colloids.

The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase.</b> Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. flocculation, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the size}} of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> may be {{difficult}} to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

Peculiarities of {{separation}} processes in cyclone battery separators {{have been considered}} on liquid and solid <b>disperse</b> <b>phases.</b> The difference in efficiency between individual and battery liquid separators is slight. Concentration of <b>disperse</b> liquid <b>phase</b> in refined gases is 0. 1 – 0. 3 kg/kg. In operating on dry gases with abundance of dust the separation condition changes due to peculiarities of <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> behavior from solid particles. Flow parameter assessments in cyclones by different correlation of flow areas at the input and output have been conducted. Differences of flow parameters in conical and cylindrical cyclones have been explored. The analysis and causes of unsatisfied work of industrial battery separator with cyclone elements have been carried out. Battery devices with cyclone elements are extensively used in {{oil and gas industry}} for extraction of liquid and solid impurities from natural and petroleum gas [1].

40|$|The {{development}} of a rheological model for aggregated suspensions i necessarily based upon a suitable characterization f {{the structure of the}} <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> and of the structural modifications produced by a deformation or a velocity field. The <b>disperse</b> <b>phases</b> of real aggregate particle suspensions, both dilute and concentrated, may present awide variety of structures, which can be conveniently characterized byusing the concepts of fractal geometry. In the present paper we formulate arheological model able to correlate the structural processes induced by shear flow conditions and the consequent shear dependence of viscosity with the shear stress changes experienced by the suspension. The flow curves calculated from the model, both for dense and fractal aggregates, closely resemble those observed for real colloidal and non-colloidal suspensions. The model appears particularly advantageous in describing the transition from shear thinning to plastic behavior, which usually occurs with increasing volume fraction or aggregation of the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase.</b> The role played by the aggregation state of the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> becomes predominant in the low shear stress range, where aggregates may be composed of many particles, and, consequently, where the fractal dimensionality D becomes an important parameter in determining the compactness of the aggregate structure and the rheological behavior of concentrated suspensions. The validity of the proposed model is checked further through an analysis of experimental viscosity data relative to two series of epoxy-acrylic systems, containing titanium dioxide and aluminum silicate at different <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Cross-flow {{membrane}} emulsification {{has great}} potential to produce monodisperse emulsions and emulsions with shear sensitive components. However, until now, only low <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> fluxes were obtained. A low flux maybe a limiting factor for emulsion production {{on a commercial}} scale. Therefore, the effects of membrane parameters on the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> flux are estimated. Besides, {{the effects of these}} parameters on the droplet size and droplet size distribution are qualitatively described. Wetting properties, pore size and porosity mainly determine the droplet size (distribution). Membrane morphology largely determines the <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> flux. As an example, industrial-scale production of culinary cream was chosen to evaluate the required membrane area of different types of membranes: an SPG membrane, an alpha-Al 2 O 3 membrane and a microsieve. Due to the totally different morphologies of these membranes, the fraction of active pores is I for a microsieve and is very low for the other membranes. The choice of the optimal membrane did not depend on the production strategy: either to produce large quantities or to produce monodisperse emulsions, the best suitable was a microsieve with an area requirement of around I m(2). In general, the total membrane resistance should be low to obtain a large <b>disperse</b> <b>phase</b> flux. In contrast, the membrane resistance should be high to obtain monodisperse emulsions when using membranes with a high porosity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
