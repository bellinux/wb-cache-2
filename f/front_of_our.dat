500|$|Pujols began 2008 by {{reaching}} base in 42 straight games, the longest streak {{to open a}} season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999. On June 11, he {{was placed on the}} DL with a strained left calf muscle. Although he was expected to miss three weeks, he was activated from the DL on June 26. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2–1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game that to him it was [...] "just another homer that goes out of the park. I'm happy to do it in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans—they were waiting for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{land based}} {{artillery}} of Bulfin's XXI Corps' heavy artillery consisted of 68 medium and heavy guns and howitzers, which were directed {{on to the}} Ottoman batteries during the battle. In addition two 6-inch guns made a surprise attack on the Ottoman railhead at Beit Hanun at a range of , supported by balloon observation. Between 27 October and the attack on Gaza, 15,000 rounds were fired by the heavy artillery; three hundred rounds were allocated {{for the destruction of}} each Ottoman battery which had been located. The anti–battery bombardments between 29–31 October also fired gas shells, which apparently had little or no effect. Together with the corps' three divisional artilleries, the guns produced the heaviest bombardment of World War I outside European theatres. The sixth night's bombardment from onshore and offshore guns produced [...] "an even heavier concentration of fire on a small area than had been put in {{on the first day of}} the Battle of the Somme." [...] The six-day bombardment program was arranged [...] "so that the whole of the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> group is plastered all day and every day." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} English has words like {{before and after}} that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims {{regarding}} Aymara uniqueness. However, these words relate events to other events and {{are part of the}} moving-events metaphor. In fact, when before means in front of ego, it can mean only future. For instance, our future is laid out before us while our past is behind us. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as qhipa uru, literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua speakers, whose expression qhipa p'unchaw corresponds directly to Aymara qhipa uru. [...] Possibly, the metaphor is that the past is visible to us (in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eyes) while the future is not.|$|E
