5|$|Ants {{are active}} {{all year long}} in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter {{in a state of}} {{dormancy}} known as hibernation. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was {{launched}} by NASA. This spacecraft {{was designed to}} observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar flares {{during a time of}} high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this <b>inactive</b> <b>state.</b> In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotic {{genes are}} {{organized}} into operons, with multiple protein-coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit. The genes in an operon are transcribed {{as a continuous}} messenger RNA, {{referred to as a}} polycistronic mRNA. The term cistron in this context is equivalent to gene. The transcription of an operon’s mRNA is often controlled by a repressor that can occur in an active or <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> depending on the presence of certain specific metabolites. When active, the repressor binds to a DNA sequence {{at the beginning of the}} operon, called the operator region, and represses transcription of the operon; when the repressor is inactive transcription of the operon can occur (see e.g. Lac operon). The products of operon genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network.|$|E
25|$|In excitable cells such as neurons, myocytes, {{and certain}} types of glia, sodium {{channels}} {{are responsible for the}} rising phase of action potentials. These channels go through 3 different states called as resting, active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states.</b> Even though the resting and <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> wouldn't allow the ions to flow through the channels the difference exists with respect to their structural conformation.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the evolution of}} well-organized social behaviour, we must first {{understand the}} mechanism by which collective behaviour establishes. In this study, the mechanisms of collective behaviour in a colony of social insects were studied {{in terms of the}} transition probability between active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states,</b> which is linked to mutual interactions. The active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> of the social insects were statistically extracted from the velocity profiles. From the duration distributions of the two states, we found that 1) the durations of active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> follow an exponential law, and 2) pair interactions increase the transition probability from <b>inactive</b> to active <b>states.</b> The regulation of the transition probability by paired interactions suggests that such interactions control the populations of active and inactive workers in the colony...|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states.</b> The binding of FSH to the receptor shifts the equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. FSH and FSH-agonists shift the equilibrium in favor of active states; FSH antagonists shift the equilibrium in favor of <b>inactive</b> <b>states.</b> For a cell to respond to FSH, {{only a small percentage}} (~1%) of receptor sites need to be activated.|$|R
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively <b>inactive</b> <b>state.</b> The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} Gaussian {{network model}} based normal mode analysis of 3 -dimensional structures of multiple active and inactive forms of protein kinases. In 14 different kinases, a more number of residues (1095) show higher structural fluctuations in <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> {{than those in}} active states (525), suggesting that, in general, mobility of <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> is higher than active states. This statistically significant difference is consistent with higher crystallographic B-factors and conformational energies for <b>inactive</b> than active <b>states,</b> suggesting lower stability of inactive forms. Only {{a small number of}} inactive conformations with the DFG motif in the ``in'' state were found to have fluctuation magnitudes comparable to the active conformation. Therefore our study reports for the first time, intrinsic higher structural fluctuation for almost all inactive conformations compared to the active forms. Regions with higher fluctuations in the <b>inactive</b> <b>states</b> are often localized to the aC-helix, aG-helix and activation loop which are involved in the regulation and/or in structural transitions between active and <b>inactive</b> <b>states.</b> Further analysis of 476 kinase structures involved in interactions with another domain/protein showed that many of the regions with higher inactive-state fluctuation correspond to contact interfaces. We also performed extensive GNM analysis of (i) insulin receptor kinase bound to another protein and (ii) holo and apo forms of active and inactive conformations followed by multi-factor analysis of variance. We conclude that binding of small molecules or other domains/proteins reduce the extent of fluctuation irrespective of active or inactive forms. Finally, we show that the perceived fluctuations serve as a useful input to predict the functional state of a kinase...|$|R
25|$|It is {{believed}} that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and <b>inactive</b> biophysical <b>states.</b> The binding of ligands to the receptor may shift the equilibrium toward the active receptor states. Three types of ligands exist: Agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of active states; inverse agonists are ligands that shift the equilibrium in favour of inactive states; and neutral antagonists are ligands that do not affect the equilibrium.

5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their <b>inactive</b> <b>state,</b> but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|Aconitine binds to the {{receptor}} at the neurotoxin {{binding site}} 2 on the alpha-subunit {{of the channel}} protein. This binding results in a sodium-ion channel that stays open longer. Aconitine suppresses the conformational change in the sodium-ion channel from the active state to the <b>inactive</b> <b>state.</b> The membrane stays depolarized due to the constant sodium influx (which is 10-1000 fold greater than the potassium efflux). As a result, the membrane cannot be repolarized. The binding of aconitine to the channel also leads to the channel to change conformation from the <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> to the active state at a more negative voltage.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proteins}} exist {{which may}} augment {{the activity of}} Ras family proteins.

Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the molecular chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences (estrogen response element, ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days.|$|E
25|$|Important {{differences}} exist between integrin-signaling in circulating blood cells and non-circulating cells such as epithelial cells; integrins of circulating cells are normally inactive. For example, cell membrane integrins on circulating leukocytes are maintained in an <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> to avoid epithelial cell attachment; they are activated only {{in response to}} stimuli such as those received {{at the site of}} an inflammatory response. In a similar manner, integrins at the cell membrane of circulating platelets are normally kept inactive to avoid thrombosis. Epithelial cells (which are non-circulating) normally have active integrins at their cell membrane, helping maintain their stable adhesion to underlying stromal cells that provide signals to maintain normal functioning.|$|E

25|$|Binding of an agonist ligand to the CB1 {{receptor}} provokes a {{conformational change}} {{and leads to}} the active state of the receptor {{which is responsible for}} the signal transduction. However, there is an additional mechanism that can lead to the active state in the absence of ligand. As numerous other GPCRs, CB1 receptor displays a high level of constitutive activity and thus it can spontaneously adopt an active conformational state in the absence of agonist binding, keeping elevated basal levels of intracellular signaling. This {{can be explained by the}} two state-model of receptor activation in which receptors are in equilibrium between two states, active and inactive (R* and R). An agonist will stabilize the active state leading to activation, a neutral antagonist binds equally to active and inactive states, whereas an inverse agonist will preferentially stabilize the <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> (Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input {{several levels}} above the actual MAP kinase. In {{contrast to the}} relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tighly locked into an <b>inactive</b> <b>state</b> by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates.|$|E
