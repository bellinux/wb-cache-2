5000|$|HK91: The HK91 is a {{semi-automatic}} {{version of}} the G3 similar to the HK41, also marketed to civilians. However, in order to comply with US firearm regulations a number of modifications to the HK91 were made that do not appear on the first pattern HK41. Internal parts that could allow <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire were removed. A shelf was welded onto the receiver where the push-pin of the trigger pack would normally go, to prevent installation of a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> trigger <b>pack.</b> This did not allow {{the use of the}} paddle style magazine release and so the magazine release button {{on the right side of}} the magazine well must be used instead. It is otherwise identical to the G3A3/A4. Importation into the United States began in 1974 and ceased in 1989, with some 48,000 rifles being imported.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> markers fire {{continually}} {{when the}} trigger is pressed. The Tippmann SMG 60 {{was the first}} <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> paintball marker. Most electropneumatic paintball guns feature this mode. The <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode {{can be added to}} any electropneumatic marker by installing a customized logic board, or buying a completely new electronic trigger frame.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mechanims for {{rubber band}} guns are {{analogous}} to <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm mechanisms, {{in that the}} energy used to drive the gun's mechanism {{is derived from the}} same source as that which provides energy to propel the projectiles. In the case of <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> rubber band guns, the mechanism-driving energy is the elastic potential energy stored in the stretched rubber band ammunition loaded onto the gun. <b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> designs pose significant challenges to designers, such as how to control rate of fire.|$|R

50|$|The {{most widely}} known product in Haloilaâ€™s product range is the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> {{wrapping}} machine, Octopus, with over 5,500 <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> stretch wrapping machines manufactured so far.

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to legally acquire <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms at American gun shows (as opposed to the semiautomatic-only versions of these firearms that are legal on the U.S. civilian market), due to National Firearms Act (NFA). To legally purchase or transfer a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm, U.S. citizens must pay a $200 transfer tax, submit {{a full set of}} fingerprints on FBI Form FD-258, obtain certification provided by a chief law enforcement officer ("CLEO": the local chief of police, sheriff of the county, head of the State police, or State or local district attorney or prosecutor), and obtain final approval from the BATF on a Form 4 transfer of NFA registration to the new owner. All private citizens must wait, typically months, before receiving the tax stamp for the $200 tax paid, authorizing taking possession of the already paid-for <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm. Until in receipt of the tax stamp, the Class III dealer retains control of the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearm. In addition, only <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms manufactured before the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of 1986 are permitted to be transferred. No <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms recovered in Mexico have been traced to the United States.|$|R

50|$|A {{machine gun}} is a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mounted or {{portable}} firearm designed to fire bullets {{in quick succession}} from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically {{at a rate of}} 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Not all <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms are machine guns. Submachine guns, rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols or cannons may be capable of <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire, but are not designed for sustained fire. As a class of military rapid-fire guns, machine guns are <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> weapons designed to be used as support weapons and generally used when attached to a mount or fired from the ground on a bipod or tripod. Many (but not all) machine guns also use belt feeding and open bolt operation, features not normally found on rifles.|$|R

50|$|After 1920, the MP 18 was {{modified}} {{to use a}} straight magazine {{similar to those used}} in the later developed MP 40 submachine gun. The MP18 could only fire in the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode. Its successor, the MP 28/2, received a modified mechanism with a selector for single shot or <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Luger, the Mauser C96 pistol was {{modified}} to {{fire in a}} <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode. It was produced in 1896, {{and was one of}} the first commercially successful and practical semi-automatic pistols. In the late 1920s, Spanish gunmakers introduced [...] "selective fire" [...] copies of the C96 with detachable magazines, and in the early 1930s Mauser engineers introduced the model 711 and 712 Schnellfeuer variants, which included a fire selector mechanism allowing <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire at a rate of 1000 rounds/minute. Due to the weapon's light barrel, the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> rate of fire could only be used for short bursts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{burst mode}} is {{normally}} employed {{as an intermediate}} fire mode between semi-automatic and <b>fully</b> <b>automatic,</b> although some firearms lack a [...] "full auto" [...] capability and use a burst mode instead. For instance, the M16A4 (the standard-issue service rifle of the USMC) has, {{in addition to the}} semi-automatic mode, a three-round burst mode, which replaced the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode of the previous M16A1 and A3 models. The reason for this replacement was the massive waste of ammunition and very poor performance of soldiers who fired their rifles in <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode during the Vietnam War.|$|R
