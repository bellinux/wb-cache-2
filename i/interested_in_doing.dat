Upon his return to Australia, there were attempts to secure Fisher a seat in parliament and lead the Labor Party once more, {{but he was not}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> so. In 1922 he returned to London and lived in retirement at South Hill Park, Hampstead, for the remainder of his life. In his final years, Fisher gradually succumbed to the effects of dementia, such that he would ultimately lose the ability to even sign his own name. He caught a severe bout of influenza in September 1928 and died a month later. He is buried at Hampstead Cemetery in West Hampstead.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus was an Augustan elegiac {{poet who}} offered an {{alternative}} lifestyle to the Roman {{ideal of the}} military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his existing first two books of poetry he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus as a commander and soldier {{to that of a}} farmer. Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, adsiduus labor, and military service (militia). He shows in his poetry that originally otium was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons. Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> it sometimes (interdum) and therefore inserts otium (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life. He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of ignobile otium (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldy ambitions.|$|E

25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing,</b> but The Haunted had done it {{for almost a decade}} straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E
