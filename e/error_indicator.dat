50|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the bottlenecks of the Critical path approach implementation of AVS system, the Razor approach is used. Unlike the critical path approach where a single path is identified as critical path, Razor approach has a set of potential critical paths {{that are to be}} monitored. In this approach an on-chip timing checker is employed to check the timing margin of the set of critical path. A delayed version of the system clock is used by the timing circuit to capture the data in shadow latch which is same as the data captured by the master(main) flipflop. Wherever the sub paths become critical, additional shadow latches are introduced. When the supply voltage is scaled the value latched in the main flipflop might be different from that of those latched by the shadow latches, which results in an error signals. The error signals from all the shadow latches are gathered to generate a single <b>error</b> <b>indicator.</b> This error is corrected by flushing the pipeline and reloading the state that was existing before the error occurred. When the error rates decrease beyond certain limits the supply voltage is reduced till the point where the error tends to become unacceptable.|$|E

This study aims to 1) develop an efficient p-refinement procedure with a non-uniform p analysis capability for solving 2 -D and 3 -D elastostatic mechanics problems, and 2) introduce a stress error estimate. An element-by-element algorithm that decides the appropriate order for each element, where element orders can range from 1 to 8, is described.
