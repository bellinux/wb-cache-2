The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers (marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., hashish) are consumed by smoking, vaporising and oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures, teas and ointments have also been common preparations. In traditional medicine of India in particular C. sativa has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.|$|E

40|$|Hempseed with {{scientific}} name Cannabis sativa, spreads across the world. <b>Hempseed</b> <b>oil’s</b> fatty acids compounds {{were obtained from}} different parts of Iran with different weather and were tested. The herb contains canabidole, canabinol and canabidiolic acid. The herb is used for preparing some sedation drugs which are used in neural stresses, anxiety, migraine, asthmatic coughs as well as local anesthesia in dentistry. Stuart points out that all parts of hempseed are used in China traditional medicine. Its seed is used as tonic, strengthening, laxative, diuretic, calmative, gastric anti parasite and narcotic. Masson and Teobold say that hempseed has a great value for tetanus treatment. Hempseed is a real calmative for stomachache and digestive disorders as well as beneficial for cancers, ulcers and rheumatic pains. In the present study, 30 Wistar male rats of 200 - 230 g weight and about 3 months old were used for laboratory experiments. Animals were kept in standard condition, at 20 - 25 °C, 70 % humidity and light cycle of 12 h lighting and 12 h darkness.

40|$|We {{present a}} small and very simple {{reformer}} that converts widely available vegetable, animal, or even waste oils into the Synthesis Gas (and then to Hydrogen extracted from it, if necessary) for Fuel Cells or other uses. This plasma-assisted reformer does not require any cleaning or drying of bio-carbonaceous feedstock; all mineral and other impurities are accepted. The reforming is driven by high-voltage discharges (called GlidArc) that catalytically assist the exothermic partial oxidation process. Such electric assistance requires less than 2 % of the Lower Heating Value power of produced SynGas. Recycling such {{a small portion of}} power is therefore an acceptable compromise. The unique oxidant source is air. As an example we present the feasibility tests with commercial rapeseed oil in a 1 -L reformer working at atmospheric pressure. Nitrogen-diluted SynGas containing up to 40 % of H 2 +CO at total feedstock conversion is produced in absence of the soot or coke. The flow of produced syngas corresponds to 11 kW of electric power of an ideal Fuel Cell. These positive results open a way to other renewable feedstock reforming into the SynGas such as peanut, palm, soybean, sunflower, <b>hempseed,</b> and other <b>oils</b> as well as molasses and other secondary or waste products of a food processing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Hempseed</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{rich and}} {{balanced}} source of omega- 6 and omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Anecdotal evidence indicated that dietary <b>hempseed</b> <b>oil</b> might be useful in treating symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

Fatty acid profiles were measured in plasma triglyceride, cholesteryl and phospholipid fractions. A patient questionnaire provided additional information on skin dryness, itchiness and usage of dermal medications. Skin transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was also measured. Results: Levels of both essential fatty acids (EFAs), linoleic acid (18 : 2 n 6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n 3), and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; 18 : 3 n 6) increased in all lipid fractions after <b>hempseed</b> <b>oil,</b> with no significant increases of arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n 6) in any lipid fractions after either oil.

The aim of current research was to increase oxidative stability of vegetable oils with natural antioxidants. Herein, we demonstrate that the oxidative stability can be increased with natural antioxidants present in oat hulls and sea buckthorn pomace – by-products of food processing. Extracts from pomace and hulls were prepared by maceration of ground plant material in the <b>hempseed</b> <b>oil.</b> The extraction was accelerated by ultrasound. It was established that the highest amount of polyphenols in extracts of both plant materials can be achieved within 30 min; further increase of extraction time sometimes even reduced the total amount of polyphenols.

The <b>hempseed</b> <b>oil</b> was mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids and, as expected, the dominant fatty acids were linoleic and α-linolenic acid. A high variability among the cultivars and accessions was also detected for polyphenolic content which ranged from 5. 88 to 10. 63 g kg- 1 DM, cv. Felina was the richest, whereas cv.

Regarding antinutritional compounds in seed, a high variability was detected among all genotypes analyzed and phytic acid was particularly abundant (ranging between 43 and 75 g kg- 1 DM). In conclusion, our results reveal noticeable differences among hempseed genotypes for antinutritional components, oil and protein content. Collectively, this study suggests that the hempseed is an interesting product in terms of protein, oil and antioxidant molecules but a reduction of phytic acid would be desirable for both humans and monogastric animals.
