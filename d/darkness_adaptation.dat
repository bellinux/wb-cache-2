40|$|AbstractBoth {{short-term}} and long-term adaptations of cyanobacterial metabolism to {{light and dark}} were studied in Nostoc sp. Mac. Long-term adaptations were induced by growing cells {{in the presence of}} glucose under (a) 30 μE m− 2 s− 1 continuous white light, (b) under a 14 / 10 h light/dark cycle, or (c) complete darkness. Short-term regulation of enzyme activities by light was then studied in cells rendered osmotically fragile with lysozyme. Cells were briefly illuminated then enzyme activities were measured following rapid lysis in a hypotonic assay medium. The following results were obtained. (1) Relative to fresh weight, dark-grown cells contained less chlorophyll, much less phycoerythrin, but similar amounts of phycocyanin compared to cells grown under either light regime. Relative to chlorophyll, the higher phycocyanin and much lower phycoerythrin in the dark-grown vs light-grown cells resembles long term changes in pigment content that occur during complementary chromatic adaptation to red vs orange light. (2) Both dark and light/dark grown cells displayed generally lowered photosynthetic activities compared to light-grown cells. The exception to this was the activity of fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase, which was higher in dark-grown cells. However, the photosynthetic induction period was markedly shorter in the light/dark-grown cells indicating an adaptation to changing illumination during growth. (3) Inhibitor studies using methyl viologen show that the fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase is reversibly light-activated in vivo by the cyanobacterial thioredoxin system under all growth conditions. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity was detected in cells grown in all conditions and this activity was reversibly deactivated by light or by dithiothreitol. In contrast, the protonmotive ATPase F 0 F 1 -type ATPase was fully active in both light and dark-adapted cells regardless of the light regime used for growth. (4) It is concluded that the Calvin cycle enzymes, their short-term regulatory system, including thioredoxin, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and an F 0 F 1 ATPase not under thioredoxin control, are expressed in cells grown in complete <b>darkness.</b> <b>Adaptation</b> to heterotrophic growth in this cyanobacterium does not appear to involve synthesis of different enzyme forms lacking thioredoxin control sequences...|$|E
40|$|Chloroplast gene {{expression}} is predominantly regulated at the posttranscriptional levels of mRNA stability and translation efficiency. The expression of psbA, an important photosynthesis-related chloroplast gene, has been {{revealed to be}} regulated via its 5 ’- untranslated region (UTR). Some cis-acting elements within this 5 ’UTR and the correlated trans-acting factors have been defined in Chlamydomonas. However, no in vivo evidence {{with respect to the}} cis-acting elements of the psbA 5 ’UTR has been so far achieved in higher plants such as tobacco. To attempt this, we generated a series of mutants of the tobacco psbA 5 ’UTR by base alterations and sequence deletions, with special regard to the stem-loop structure and the putative target sites for ribosome association and binding of nuclear regulatory factors. In addition, a versatile plastid transformation vector pKCZ with an insertion site in the inverted repeat region of the plastid genome was constructed. In all constructs, the psbA 5 ’UTR (Wt or modified) was used as the 5 ’ leader of the reporter gene uidA under control of the same promoter, Prrn, the promoter of the rRNA operon. Through biolistic DNA delivery to tobacco chloroplasts, transplastomic plants were obtained. DNA and RNA analyses of these transplastomic plants demonstrated that the transgenes aadA and uidA had been correctly integrated into the plastome at the insertion site, and transcribed in discrete sizes. Quantitative assays were also done to determine the proportion of intact transplastome, the uidA mRNA level, Gus activity, and uidA translation efficiency. The main results are the following: 1) The insertion site at the unique MunI between two tRNA genes (trnR-ACG and trnNGUU) is functional. Vector pKCZ has a large flexibility for further DNA manipulations and hence is useful for future applications. 2) The stem-loop of the psbA 5 ’UTR is required for mRNA stabilisation and translation. All mutants related to this region showed a 2 ~ 3 fold decrease in mRNA stability and a 1. 5 ~ 6 fold reduction in translation efficiency. The function of this stem-loop depends on its correct sequence and secondary conformation. 3) the AU-box of the psbA 5 ’UTR is a crucial translation determinant. Mutations of this element almost abolished translation efficacy (up to 175 -fold decrease), but did not significantly affect mRNA accumulation. The regulatory role of the AU-Box is sequencedependent and might be affected by its inner secondary structure. 4) The internal AUG codon of the psbA 5 ’UTR is unable to initiate translation. An introduction of mRNA translatability from this codon failed to direct the translation of reporter uidA gene, overriding the mutation of the AU-Box. 5) The 5 ’end poly(A) sequence does not confer a distinct regulatory signal. The deletion of this element only insignificantly affected mRNA abundance and translation. However, this mutation might slightly disturb the conformation of the stem-loop, resulting in a moderate decrease in translation efficiency (~ 1. 5 fold). 6) The SD(Shine-Dalgarno) -like RBS (ribosome binding site) of the psbA 5 ’UTR appears to be an indispensable element for translation initiation. Mutation of this element led to a dramatically low expression of the uidA gene as seen by Gus staining. 7) The 5 ’end structural sequence of the rbcL 5 ’UTR does not convey a high mRNA stabilising effect to the psbA 5 ’UTR in a cycling condition of the light and the dark. Their distinct roles appear to be involved in <b>darkness</b> <b>adaptation.</b> Furthermore, with respect to the overall regulatory function of the psbA 5 ’UTR, two models are proposed, i. e. dual RBS-mediated translation initiation, and cpRBPs-mediated mRNA stability and translation. The mechanisms for mRNA stabilisation entailed by the rbcL 5 ’UTR are also discussed. Direct repeat-mediated transgene loss after chloroplast transformation and other aspects related to the choice of insertion site and plastid promoter are also analysed...|$|E

40|$|The spiking {{behaviour}} of 66 second-order vestibular neurons was {{studied in}} alert, chronically prepared guinea-pigs during the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Among the 66 studied neurons, seven were held long enough (> 1 h) to compare their spiking behaviour {{before and after}} a training procedure inducing {{a decrease in the}} gain of the VOR. When tested in <b>darkness</b> following <b>adaptation,</b> five of them showed a significant decrease of their sensitivity to head rotation. However, the resting discharge of these five neurons remained unchanged. This suggests that VOR adaptation is mediated not only by changes in synaptic efficacities but also by modifications in the spike generator which transforms synaptic inputs into a pattern of action potentials...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLight {{adaptation}} {{is thought}} to be orchestrated by a Ca 2 + feedback signal that desensitizes the response by speeding recovery. To evaluate the role of Ca 2 + in adaptation, we compared the effect of lowered Ca 2 + on response properties in <b>darkness</b> and during <b>adaptation.</b> Internal Ca 2 + was reduced from its normal resting dark level (535 nM) by either background illumination or exposure to Ringer's solution containing low Ca 2 + and/or cyclic GMP–gated channel blockers in darkness. Ca 2 + reductions in light decreased the activation gain of the transduction process and speeded recovery kinetics, while equivalent Ca 2 + reductions in darkness caused similar gain reduction without accelerating recovery. This indicates that adaptational changes in the response are not due purely to feedback effects on recovery...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA rare type of {{mammalian}} retinal ganglion cell (RGC) {{expresses the}} photopigment melanopsin {{and is a}} photoreceptor. These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) drive circadian-clock resetting, pupillary constriction, and other non-image-forming photic responses. Both the light responses of ipRGCs and the behaviors they drive are remarkably sustained, raising the possibility that, unlike rods and cones, ipRGCs do not adjust their sensitivity according to lighting conditions (“adaptation”). We found, to the contrary, that ipRGC sensitivity is plastic, strongly influenced by lighting history. When exposed to a constant, bright background, the background-evoked response decayed, and responses to superimposed flashes grew in amplitude, indicating light adaptation. After extinction of a light-adapting background, sensitivity recovered progressively in <b>darkness,</b> indicating dark <b>adaptation.</b> Because these adjustments in sensitivity persisted when synapses were blocked, they constitute “photoreceptor adaptation” rather than “network adaptation. ” Implications for the mechanisms generating various non-image-forming visual responses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the kinetics and sensitivity of photocurrent responses of salamander rods, both in <b>darkness</b> and during <b>adaptation</b> to steady backgrounds producing 20 – 3, 000 photoisomerizations per second, using suction pipet recordings. The most intense backgrounds suppressed 80 % of the circulating dark current and decreased the flash sensitivity ∼ 30 -fold. To investigate the underlying transduction mechanism, we expressed the responses as {{a fraction of}} the steady level of cGMP-activated current recorded in the background. The fractional responses to flashes of any fixed intensity began rising along a common trajectory, regardless of background intensity. We interpret these invariant initial trajectories to indicate that, at these background intensities, light adaptation does not alter the gain of any of the amplifying steps of phototransduction. For subsaturating flashes of fixed intensity, the fractional responses obtained on backgrounds of different intensity were found to “peel off” from their common initial trajectory in a background-dependent manner: the more intense the background, the earlier the time of peeling off. This behavior is consistent with a background-induced reduction in the effective lifetime of {{at least one of the}} three major integrating steps in phototransduction; i. e., an acceleration of one or more of the following: (1) the inactivation of activated rhodopsin (R*); (2) the inactivation of activated phosphodiesterase (E*, representing the complex Gα–PDE of phosphodiesterase with the transducin α-subunit); or (3) the hydrolysis of cGMP, with rate constant β. Our measurements show that, over the range of background intensities we used, β increased on average to ∼ 20 times its dark-adapted value; and our theoretical analysis indicates that this increase in β is the primary mechanism underlying the measured shortening of time-to-peak of the dim-flash response and the decrease in sensitivity of the fractional response...|$|R
