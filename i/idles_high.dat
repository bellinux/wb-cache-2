40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{natural gas}} {{conforms}} to the conditions of environmental protection and renewable energy, which {{plays a significant role}} in the future development of mankind. It has made some progress in applying natural gas to the automotive industry. As we all know that the source power of automobile comes from engine, therefore, based on the study on the control algorithm of gas engine, this paper aims to provide theoretical basis for further application of gas en-gine. This paper analyzed PID control algorithm, fuzzy control algorithm and fuzzy PID control algorithm, designed cor-responding controllers based on the algorithm principles, applied these three algorithms to the idle control process of the automobile gas engine. This paper concluded that the fuzzy PID control algorithm is of higher superiority through con-trastive analysis on the control effects of theses three algorithm in the process of cooling <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> start, switching <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> to low idle and switching low <b>idle</b> to <b>high</b> <b>idle...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{engine running}} at low load and low rated speed {{is said to}} be subject to <b>high</b> <b>idling</b> conditions, a mode which {{represents}} one of the major problems currently the transport industry is facing. During this time, the engine can not work at peak operating temperature. This leads to incomplete combustion and emissions level increase due to having fuel residues in the exhaust. Also, idling results in increase in fuel consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate fuel consumption and emissions parameters under <b>high</b> <b>idling</b> conditions when diesel blended with Jatropha curcas biodiesel is used to operate a diesel engine. Although biodiesel diesel blends decrease carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, they increase nitrogen oxides emissions in <b>high</b> <b>idling</b> modes. Compared to pure diesel fuel, fuel consumption also increases under all <b>high</b> <b>idling</b> conditions for biodiesel -diesel blends, with a further increase occurring as blend percentage rises...|$|R
50|$|How long each rider {{stays in}} the race is for each team to decide. Originally, riders took stints {{of a couple of}} hours or more and the resting rider went off for a sleep or a meal. That was easier in earlier six-day races because hours could pass without riders {{attempting}} to speed away from the others. As races became more intensive, both riders from the team began riding on the track at the same time, one going fast on the short line around the bottom of the track and the other <b>idling</b> <b>higher</b> up until his turn comes to take over. Modern six-days last less than 12 hours a day and the madison is now only a featured part, so staying on the track throughout is more feasible.|$|R

50|$|Today's {{computers}} {{are far from}} energy proportional for two primary reasons. A critical issue is high static power, {{which means that the}} computer consumes significant energy even when it is <b>idle.</b> <b>High</b> static power is common in servers owing to their architectural, circuit, and manufacturing optimizations that favor very high performance instead of low power. High static power relative to the maximum loaded power results in low dynamic range, poor energy proportionality, and thus, very low efficiency at low to medium utilizations. This can be acceptable for traditional high-performance computing systems and workloads, which try to extract the maximum utilization possible out of the machines, where they are most efficient. However, in modern datacenters that run popular and large-scale cloud computing applications, servers {{spend most of their time}} around 30% utilization, and are rarely running under maximum load, which is a very energy-inefficient operating point for typical servers.|$|R

Fuel adulteration has been practiced in Nepal due to financial incentives arising from differential taxes that are imposed by the government.

40|$|Today, {{computer}} data {{networks are}} being used everywhere around us. To increase reliability most of such networks use redundant links, {{which may not be}} fully utilized at all times. The reason lies with the routing protocols, which are used to detect network faults, and at all times direct all traffic only across the best path. By doing this only the optimal path is taken advantage of, while others are <b>idle.</b> <b>High</b> end routers have the capability to redirect part of the traffic across arbitrary path, at administrator’s discretion, while maintaining fault tolerance. These mechanisms are referred to as traffic engineering. They allow to define virtual pathways which are bounded by capacity constraints of the network and demand of the traffic. This thesis compares different simple approaches to achieving the same functionality or at least allowing partial traffic redirection with fault tolerance. It describes approaches with metric modification, traffic load sharing, and use of traffic tunnels and compares these to traffic engineering regarding scalability and configuration complexity. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} native diesel motor exhaust on human lung cells in vitro, a new experimental concept was developed using an exposure device {{on the base of}} the cell cultivation system CULTEX (Patent No. DE 19801763. PCT/EP 99 / 00295) to handle the cells during a 1 -h exposure period independent of an incubator and next to an engine test rig. The final experimental set-up allows the investigation of native (chemically and physically unmodified) diesel exhaust using short distances for the transportation of the gas to the target cells. The analysis of several atmospheric compounds as well as the particle concentration of the exhaust was performed by online monitoring in parallel. To validate the complete system we concentrated on the measurement of two distinct viability parameters after exposure to air and undiluted, diluted and filtered diesel motor exhaust generated under different engine operating conditions. Cell viability was not influenced by the exposure to clean air, whereas dose-dependent cytotoxicity was found contingent on the dosage of exhaust. Additionally, the quality of exhaust, represented by two engine operating conditions (<b>idling,</b> <b>higher</b> load), also showed well-distinguishable cytotoxicity. In summary, the experimental set-up allows research on biological effects of native engine emissions using short exposure times...|$|R

50|$|The engine had {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} vanes, as used on many other engines, necessary for accelerating from <b>idle</b> to <b>high</b> thrust. However, on the Gyron Junior, {{positioning of the}} vanes was not reliable and could cause surging which, in turn, could prevent accelerating to higher thrust levels. A possibly unique feature on this engine was valve-controlled cooling air to the turbine blades. The engine had to supply air for the aircraft's boundary layer control system and the resulting thrust loss was unacceptable. To regain the thrust the turbine temperature limit was raised by using turbine blade cooling, selected only with blowing on.|$|R

30|$|These {{equations}} {{show that}} an update of the Bayesian filter {{may be viewed}} as composed of two major steps. The first step is to predict the one-step ahead probability vector by the transition probabilities and the previous belief vector, as in (3). The second step is to update current belief by the predicted probability vector and the observation, as in (4). However, obtaining observations requires channel sensing and doing so consumes energy. If the hidden process is predicted to be <b>idle</b> with <b>high</b> probability, one may avoid channel sensing and directly transmit. Similarly, if the channel is predicted to be busy with high probability, channel sensing may be avoided as well. These considerations are the motivation of this work.|$|R
