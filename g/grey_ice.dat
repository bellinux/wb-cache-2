40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The {{results of the}} analysis of data collected during {{the spring and summer}} demonstrate that ERTS- 1 imagery has a high potential for monitoring arctic sea ice conditions during the time for maximum ice extent through ice-breakup season. In the eastern Beaufort Sea area, the combination of ERTS- 1 orbital overlap and a high incidence of cloud-free conditions during the spring assures a high frequency of repetitive satellite coverage. In the mid-Beaufort Sea, numerous fractures and leads can be identified, even in the early spring data. Ice features that can be identified include: development of fractures leading to the formation of distinct ice floes; growth and deterioration of leads; evidence of shearing movements of ice masses; formation of new <b>grey</b> <b>ice</b> within leads; distinction between grey, grey-white, and older forms of ice; and the deterioration of the ice surface evidenced by the formation of puddles, thaw holes, and drainage patterns. Ice conditions in the Bering Sea near St. Lawrence Island reported by aircraft observers participating in the Bering Sea Expedition are in close agreement with the ice conditions mapped from the corresponding ERTS- 1 imagery. Ice features identified were: boundaries between <b>grey</b> <b>ice</b> and first year ice, shear leads, and occurrence of open water...|$|E

Comparison of the LANDSAT classification and the corresponding dB values from the SAR scene showed that, under the given circumstances (high surface winds), open water/nilas/grey ice as defined by a single ice category by the SAR classifier could not be distinguished from first year ice. Surface roughening due to wind appears to be a major problem for the SAR classifier, as the range of the dB values is large enough to overlap all the other ice categories. Additional information, such as surface wind speed is necessary to overcome part of this problem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{spectral}} albedo and directional reflectance {{of snow and}} sea ice were measured on sea ice of various types, including nilas, <b>grey</b> <b>ice,</b> pancake ice, multi-year pack ice, and land-fast ice in the Ross, Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas during a summer cruise in February through March 2000. Measurements were made using a spectroradiometer that has 512 channels in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region in which 16 of the 36 bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are covered. Directional reflectance is also retrieved from the MODIS radiometrically calibrated data (Level 1 B) concurrently acquired from the first National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite, Terra. The locations of the ground ice stations are identified accurately on the MODIS images, and the {{spectral albedo}} and directional reflectance values at the 16 VNIR MODIS bands are extracted for those pixel locations.

6000|$|I {{came into}} the valley, as the evening sun was shining on the remote heights of snow, that closed it in, like eternal clouds. The bases of the {{mountains}} forming the gorge in which the little village lay, were richly green; and high above this gentler vegetation, grew forests of dark fir, cleaving the wintry snow-drift, wedge-like, and stemming the avalanche. Above these, were range upon range of craggy steeps, <b>grey</b> rock, bright <b>ice,</b> and smooth verdure-specks of pasture, all gradually blending with the crowning snow. Dotted here and there on the mountain's-side, each tiny dot a home, were lonely wooden cottages, so dwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys. So did even the clustered village in the valley, with its wooden bridge across the stream, where the stream tumbled over broken rocks, and roared away among the trees. In the quiet air, there was a sound of distant singing--shepherd voices; but, as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the mountain's-side, I could almost have believed it came from there, and was not earthly music. All at once, in this serenity, great Nature spoke to me; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass, and weep as I had not wept yet, since Dora died! ...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of passive microwave sea-ice concentration (SIC) algorithms {{to the selection}} of tie points was analyzed. SICs were derived with the NASA Team ice algorithm for global tie points and for locally and seasonally adjusted tie points. The SSM/I SIC was then compared to Landsat-MSS-derived SICs. Preliminary results show a mean difference of SSM/I- and Landsat-derived SICs for 50 x 50 km grid cells of 2. 7 percent along the ice edge of the Beaufort Sea during fall with local tie points. The accuracy decreased to 9. 7 percent when global tie points were used. During freeze-up in the Beaufort Sea, with <b>grey</b> <b>ice</b> and nilas as dominant ice cover, the mean difference was 4. 3 percent for local tie points and 13. 9 percent for global tie points. For the spring ice cover in the Bering Sea a mean difference of 4. 4 percent for local tie points and 15. 7 percent for global tie points was found. This large difference reveals some limitations of the NASA-Team algorithm under freeze-up and spring conditions (thin ice areas) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Canadian sub-arctic {{is integral to}} climate variability studies and water availability forecasts for economic considerations (drinking water, hydroelectric power generation). Common passive microwave (PM) snow water equivalent (SWE) algorithms that utilize the differences in brightness temperature (Tb) at 37 GHz – 19 GHz falter in lake-rich tundra environments because of the inclusion of lakes within PM pixels. The overarching goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the use of multiple platforms and methodologies to observe and quantify the effects of lake ice and sub-ice water on passive microwave emission for the purpose of improving snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithms. Using in situ snow and ice measurements as input, the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) multi-layer snow emission model was modified to include an ice layer below the snow layer. Emission for 6. 9, 19, 37 and 89 GHz were simulated at horizontal and vertical polarizations, and were validated by high resolution airborne passive microwave measurements coincident with in situ sampling sites over two lakes near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT). Overall, the general magnitude of brightness temperatures were estimated by the HUT model for 6. 9 and 19 GHz H/V, however the variability was not. Simulations produced at 37 GHz exhibited the best agreement relative to observed temperatures. However, emission at 37 GHz does not interact with the radiometrically cold water, indicating that ice properties controlling microwave emission are not fully captured by the HUT model. Alternatively, active microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements can be used to identify ice properties that affect passive microwave emission. Dual polarized X-band SAR backscatter was utilized to identify ice types by the segmentation program MAGIC (MAp Guided Ice Classification). Airborne passive microwave transects were grouped by ice type classes and compared to backscatter measurements. In freshwater, where there were few areas of high bubble concentration at the ice/water interface Tbs exhibited positive correlations with cross-polarized backscatter, corresponding to ice types (from low to high emission/backscatter: clear ice, transition zone between clear and <b>grey</b> <b>ice,</b> <b>grey</b> <b>ice</b> and rafted ice). SWE algorithms were applied to emission within each ice type producing negative or near zero values in areas of low 19 GHz Tbs (clear ice, transition zone), but also produced positive values that were closer to the range of in situ measurements in areas of high 19 GHz Tbs (grey and rafted ice). Therefore, cross-polarized X-band SAR measurements {{can be used as a}} priori ice type information for spaceborne PM algorithms, providing information on ice types and ice characteristics (floating, frozen to bed), integral to future tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithms...|$|E
40|$|We have {{assessed}} the microbial ecology {{on the surface}} of Mittivakkat glacier in SE-Greenland during the exceptional high melting season in July 2012 when the so far most extreme melting rate for the Greenland Ice Sheet has been recorded. By employing a complementary and multi-disciplinary field sampling and analytical approach, we quantified the dramatic changes in the different microbial surface habitats (green snow, red snow, biofilms, <b>grey</b> <b>ice,</b> cryoconite holes). The observed clear change in dominant algal community and their rapidly changing cryo-organic adaptation inventory was linked to the high melting rate. The changes in carbon and nutrient fluxes between different microbial pools (from snow to ice, cryoconite holes and glacial forefronts) revealed that snow and ice algae dominate the net primary production at the onset of melting, and that they have the potential to support the cryoconite hole communities as carbon and nutrient sources. A large proportion of algal cells is retained on the glacial surface and temporal and spatial changes in pigmentation contribute to the darkening of the snow and ice surfaces. This implies that the fast, melt-induced algal growth has a high albedo reduction potential, and this may lead to a positive feedback speeding up melting processes...|$|E
40|$|High {{concentration}} of exopolysacharides (EPS) and iron {{have been found}} in sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. However, the mechanisms leading to that enrichment remain unclear. Scavenging of iron by organic matter in seawater and entrainment during sea ice formation are thought to be responsible for the accumulation of iron in sea ice. EPS could also {{play a role in the}} iron passive chelative scavenging process in sea ice and in the increase of iron bioavailability. Our study investigates the processes responsible for the accumulation of iron (dissolved, particulate and total dissolvable iron), EPS, dissolved and particulate organic matter, macro-nutrients (silicic acid, nitrate and nitrite, phosphoric acid and ammonium), chlorophyll a and sea ice algae in young sea ice during an Australian-lead spring voyage off East Antarctica (SIPEX II September – November 2012) and a German-lead winter voyage to the Weddell Sea (AWECS June – August 2013).

40|$|Three land-fast ice {{stations}} (one of {{them was}} the Finnish research ice breaker Aranda) and the German research aircraft Falcon were applied to measure the turbulent and radiation fluxes over the ice edge zone in the northern Baltic Sea during the Baltic Air-Sea-Ice Study (BASIS) field experiment from 16 February to 6 March 1998. The temporal and spatial variability of the surface fluxes is discussed. Synoptic weather systems passed the experimental area in a rapid sequence and dominated the conditions (wind speed, airsurface temperature difference, cloud field) for the variability of the turbulent and radiation fluxes. At the ice stations, the largest upward sensible heat fluxes of about 100 Wm� 2 were measured during the passage of a cold front when the air cooled faster (� 5 K per hour) than the surface. The largest downward flux of about � 200 Wm� 2 occurred during warm air advection when the air temperature reached + 10 �C but the surface temperature remained at 0 �C. Spatial variability of fluxes was observed from the small scale (scale of ice floes and open water spots) to the mesoscale (width of the ice edge zone). The degree of spatial variability depends on the synoptic situation: during melting conditions downward heat fluxes were the same over ice and open water, whereas during strong cold-air advection upward heat fluxes differed by more than 100 Wm� 2. A remarkable amount of <b>grey</b> <b>ice</b> with intermediate surface temperature was observed. The ice in the Baltic Sea cannot be described by one ice type only...|$|E
