25|$|Due to the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa's</b> {{semi-arid}} and arid climate, droughts are not uncommon. They {{are complicated}} by {{climate change and}} changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's pastoral groups have observed careful rangeland management practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983–85, 1991–92, 1998–99 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

Based on neoclassical realism and neopatrimoni-alism, two questions arise: 1. What challenges arise within Europe itself? 2. What challenges does the implementation meet locally on the Horn? It is apparent that both the member states’ individual national interests and common trans-European interests (e. g. piracy and refugee migration) take priority over the comprehensive approach in the initia-tives being implemented by the EU. This focus on short-term security and interest in the economy undermines {{the implementation of the}} Strategic Framework’s initiatives. Furthermore, many initiatives that are implemented are challenged by the weak state institutions in the countries on the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> Afri-ca or by their authoritarian regimes. The former because they are too weak to implement the EU initia-tives and the latter because long-serving leaders are largely uninterested in policies of good governance and human rights that challenge the status quo...|$|R

40|$|When first described, {{from two}} {{specimens}} taken at Bogol Manyo (='Bogol Mayo') in south-east Ethiopia in 1971, the Degodi Lark Mirafra degodiensis {{was considered a}} sibling species <b>of</b> the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa's</b> Gillett's Lark M. gilletti. However, subsequent field reports have failed to clarify how the two taxa can be separated. In order to evaluate the differences between Degodi Lark and Gillett's Lark we measured the two Degodi specimens (plus one we caught ourselves) and 43 Gillett's, reviewed {{the literature on the}} subject to assemble all the published diagnostic characters, and visited Bogol Manyo and adjacent areas to photograph, observe and sound-record both taxa. We find that there is no morphometric disjunction between the taxa, no evidence of vocal separation, no consistent plumage difference, and no molecular distinction. We therefore regard M. degodiensis as most probably a synonym of M. gilletti; if it is retained as a subspecies of gilletti it must be chiefly on account of its smaller mean size. © British Ornithologists' Club 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} opposing foreign intervention on the course and nature of warfare in the Ethiopian-Ogaden civil war. The Ogaden war, having been sporadically fought between 1963 and 1988, {{was one of the}} longest and bloodiest in the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa’s</b> turbulent history. It was typical of internal wars having directly or indirectly involved a range of regional and international actors; including the Soviet Union, the United States, Somalia, Cuba, South Yemen, Israel, East Germany and North Korea. This paper is an empirical study of the effect that external actors had on the warfare between the Ethiopian military junta (normally referred to as the Derg) and the main Ogaden Somali insurgent group, the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF), between 1976 and 1980. The warfare in the Ogaden during this period can be divided into three distinct phases: medium intensity guerrilla warfare (1976 - 77), conventional warfare (1977 - 78) and low-intensity guerrilla warfare (1978 - 80). It is argued that each phase was to a large extent determined by the type and volume of support the Derg and WSLF received from international sponsors. Finally, the paper concludes that current theory on foreign intervention, and opposing intervention in particular, fails to capture the true complexity of its impact on warfare in civil wars. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTen years ago, {{the concept}} of {{resilience}} was totally absent from the com- munications of the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). Since, ECHO has progressively introduced the word in its official documents and seems now to consider resilience {{as one of the}} generic concepts needed to summarize its action. Projects as "Supporting <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa's</b> Resilience" or communication as "The EU Approach to Resilience: Learning from Food Security Crises" are good illustrations of this recent evolution. By having a close look at how ECHO has spread the concept in its different activities (publications, funding, official events) and the definitions that are associated to it, it appears that the use of {{the concept of}} resilience -and the debate that follows it- displays the will of this institution to gain better recognition in the field of the public policies, in which its own legitimacy remains for now weak. ECHO follows a general trend initiated by the United Nation Office for Disaster Reduction and the NGOs specialized in humanitarian help, that promoted first the concept of resilience in order to gain better recognition of their work, and to advocate for an increase of their role that would be then not only connected to crisis intervention but also to prevention and development policies. Therefore, if the value of resilience as a new paradigm can be discussed, it shows a new strategy elaborated by theseorganizations to be more included in public policy elaboration processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{countries}} Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti {{are facing}} the worst food crisis of the 21 st century {{as a result of}} devastating droughts. The crisis is causing starvation and leading to a lack of access to clean water and sanitation for over 12 million people. Not only are the direct drought effects endured now by the population, but they have weakened response capacity and created diminished prospects of ever achieving future water and food security. Over the coming decades, temperatures in this region will continue to rise and rainfall patterns will change. This will create major problems for food production and availability. Thus, building resilience in communities is indispensable as we adapt our farming systems to the challenges of climate change. This will require practical solutions that can build on processes involving adaptation to climate change. The lessons learned from the UN-led project in Uganda, demonstrate the value of small scale innovative interventions, carried out using democratic approaches to help support adaptation to climate change whilst progressing to achieve food security and chart a new Path to eliminate hunger.

40|$|International audienceThe {{domains of}} the ancient polities D'MT and Aksum in the <b>Horn</b> <b>of</b> <b>Africa's</b> {{highlands}} are a superior natural system for evaluating roles of environmental change on {{the rise and fall}} of civilizations. To compare environmental changes of the times of the two polities, we analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic ratios (δD) of land-plant derived fatty acids (n-C 26 - 30) and other proxies from soil sequences spanning the Holocene from the region. Three results suggest that trends in δD values unambiguously reflect changes in rainfall. First, increases in δD coincide with dry periods inferred from studies of eastern African lakes. Second, changes in δD values were parallel among sections during overlapping time intervals. Third, consideration of vegetation history did not alter directions of trends in δD values over time. By unambiguously recording precipitation, the δD values also enhanced interpretations of proxies that are affected by both climate and land clearing. Both D'MT (ca 2750 - 2350 cal y BP) and the Aksumite (ca 2100 - 1250 cal y BP) rose during wetter intervals of the drier part of the Holocene (after ca 6000 cal y BP). Analyses of charred matter indicated that fire had been a common agent of land clearing in all sites. The influence of climate on fire varied, however. Prior to the emergence of D'MT, δD values were correlated with C 4 :C 3 plant ratios estimated from δ 13 C values. There are no C 4 trees and precipitation may have been the main influence on canopy openness. After ca 4300 cal y BP, there was no significant relationship between δD and C 4 :C 3 plant ratios suggesting that factors such as fire influenced canopy openness regardless of climate. Furthermore, the impact of land clearance differed between sites and between D'MT and the Aksumite's times. In one site, the interval from 3550 cal y BP to the decline of D'MT had several anomalies that suggested dramatic increases in thermal severity of fire and human impact. Among these were a large contribution of charred matter to a high% total organic carbon that low hydrogen and oxygen indices suggest was severely altered by other factors than humification. These results support hypotheses about the rise of civilizations being favored by specific climatic conditions but suggest that patterns of land clearing differed during the declines of D'MT and the Aksumite...|$|R
