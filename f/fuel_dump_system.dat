2500|$|... 737s are not {{equipped}} with fuel dump systems. The original aircraft {{were too small}} to require them, and adding a <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>system</b> to the later, larger variants would have incurred a large weight penalty. Boeing instead demonstrated an [...] "equivalent level of safety". Depending upon {{the nature of the}} emergency, 737s either circle to burn off fuel or land overweight. If the latter is the case, the aircraft is inspected by maintenance personnel for damage and then returned to service if none is found.|$|E
50|$|As jets began {{flying with}} US {{airlines}} {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the FAA rule in effect at the time mandated that if the ratio between an aircraft's maximum structural takeoff weight and its maximum structural landing weight was greater than 105%, the aircraft {{had to have a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>system</b> installed. Aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and 727 and the Douglas DC-8 had fuel dump systems. Any of those aircraft needing to return to a takeoff airport above the maximum landing weight would jettison an amount of fuel sufficient to reduce the aircraft's weight below that maximum landing weight limit, and then land.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1960s, Boeing {{introduced}} the 737, and Douglas {{introduced the}} DC-9, the original models of each being for shorter routes; the 105% figure {{was not an}} issue, thus they had no fuel dump systems installed. During the 1960s and 1970s, both Boeing and Douglas [...] "grew" [...] their respective aircraft as far as operational capabilities were concerned via Pratt & Whitney's development of increasingly powerful variants of the JT8D engines that powered both aircraft series. Both aircraft were now capable of longer duration flights, with increased weight limits, and complying with the existing 105% rule became problematic due to {{the costs associated with}} adding a <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>system</b> to aircraft in production. Considering the more powerful engines that had been developed, the FAA changed the rules to delete the 105% requirement, and FAR 25.1001 was enacted stating a jettison system was not required if the climb requirements of FAR 25.119 (Landing Climb) and FAR 25.121 (Approach Climb) could be met, assuming a 15-minute flight. In other words, for a go-around with full landing flaps and all engines operating, and at approach flap setting and one engine inoperative, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Long range twin jets {{such as the}} Boeing 767 and the Airbus A300, A310, and A330 may or may {{not have}} <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending}} upon how the aircraft was ordered, since on some aircraft they are a customer option. Three- and four-engine jets like the Lockheed L-1011, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 / MD-11, Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 usually have difficulty meeting the requirements of FAR 25.119 near maximum structural takeoff weight, thus most of those have jettison systems. A Boeing 757 has no <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> capability as its maximum landing weight is similar to the maximum take-off weight. Airbus positions the dumping nozzles on the wing fairing.|$|R
50|$|Since most {{twin jet}} airliners can meet these requirements, most {{aircraft}} {{of this type}} such as the Boeing 737 (all models), the DC-9/MD80 and Boeing 717, the A320 family and various regional jet ("RJ") aircraft do not have <b>fuel</b> <b>dump</b> <b>systems</b> installed. In {{the event of an}} emergency, requiring a return to the departure airport, the aircraft circles nearby in order to consume fuel to get down to within the maximum structural landing weight limit, or, if the situation demands, simply lands overweight without delay. Modern aircraft are designed with possible overweight landings in mind, but this is not done except in cases of emergency, and various maintenance inspections are required afterwards.|$|R
