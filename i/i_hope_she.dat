500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|An early January 1999 Marist Institute of Public Opinion {{poll showed}} Giuliani {{trailing}} Clinton by 10 points. [...] By January 2000, the Marist poll showed Giuliani up by 9 points. [...] Giuliani's tactics involved intentionally baiting the Clinton campaign with deliberate overstatements, keeping them off balance and {{behind in the}} response cycle. [...] Giuliani emphasized his depiction of Clinton as a carpetbagger. [...] He made a one-day visit to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he announced he would fly the Arkansas state flag over New York's City Hall. [...] When Hillary Clinton visited New York from Washington, he said, [...] "I hope she knows the way. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> doesn’t get lost {{on one of the}} side streets." [...] Giuliani's campaign prepared a 315-page opposition research dossier that went back to her time at Wellesley College; it included eleven pages of what they termed [...] "Stupid Actions and Remarks". [...] The Giuliani campaign had no problems raising money, getting over 40percent of its funds from out-of-state and outraising Clinton overall two-to-one.|$|E

500|$|Susan B. Anthony, Stanton's {{best and}} most {{faithful}} collaborator, concluded after years of working for women's rights that the concentration on one issue—votes for women—was the key to bringing success to the movement. The women's organizations had too varied a membership to agree on anything more complex. Stanton insisted, however, that the women's rights conventions were too narrowly focused; she brought forward a variety of challenging concepts {{in the form of}} essays for Anthony to read to the audiences. When Stanton made known her interest in completing The Woman's Bible, Anthony was unhappy at the futility of the effort, a harmful digression from the focused path which led to woman suffrage. Anthony wrote to Clara Bewick Colby to say of Stanton [...] "of all her great speeches, I am always proud—but of her Bible commentaries, I am not proud—either of their spirit or letter... But I shall love and honor her to the end—whether her Bible please me or not. So <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> will do for me." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Idolator's {{staff members}} wrote that [...] "Dance for You" [...] is a [...] "dangerously slick slow-jam". Similarly, [...] Carrie Batta of Pitchfork Media {{commented that the}} song is an [...] "impeccable slow jam". Describing the song as [...] "saucy", Pip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus wrote that [...] "Dance for You" [...] {{is the best of}} the three deluxe tracks. Natalie Finn of E! Online {{described}} the song as a [...] "come-hither love letter to the man in her life, set to a sultry beat". By contrast, Joshua Glossner of The Daily Collegian found the song to be too lengthy, adding, [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> hurries up and shows him how much she loves him before the eternity-long track is done." [...] He further noted that [...] "Dance For You" [...] immediately reminded him of Ciara's [...] "Promise" [...] (2006). Marc Hogan of Spin magazine found [...] "Dance for You" [...] to be [...] "a sort of strip-club jam set, as {{with the rest of the}} album". He added that the song would fit squarely on a track by The Weeknd, owing to [...] "the bluesy guitar and smoky organ". However, he concluded that [...] "it's not exactly worth plunking down another 32 bucks for". Danielle Cheesman of MSN Music showed high favoritism for [...] "Dance for You", writing: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Welch starred with Marcello Mastroianni in the Italian film Shoot Loud... Louder... I Don't Understand for Joe E. Levine. The same year, she {{appeared}} in the film Sex Quartet (1966) as Elena in the segment [...] "Fata Elena". She was the only American in the cast of the anthology film The Oldest Profession (1967); her segment was directed by Michael Pfleghar. In Italy, she also appeared in a heist movie for MGM, The Biggest Bundle of Them All (1968). It co-starred Edward G. Robinson who said of Welch, [...] "I must say she has quite a body. She has been {{the product of a}} good publicity campaign. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> lives up to it because a body will only take you so far." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} her myself," [...] Tom said, rather ruefully; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she's</b> all right, Mrs. Grantham, {{and that you}} and Miss Graham will find {{everything}} you want." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>she</b> can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E
