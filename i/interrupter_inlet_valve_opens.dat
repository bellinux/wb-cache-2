50|$|In {{the simple}} case, {{this can be}} a {{relatively}} simple task as in the internal combustion engine in which the <b>valves</b> always <b>open</b> and close at the same points. This is not the ideal arrangement for a steam engine, though, because greatest power is achieved by keeping the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> throughout the power stroke (thus having full boiler pressure, minus transmission losses, against the piston throughout the stroke) while peak efficiency is achieved by only having the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> for a short time and then letting the steam expand in the cylinder (expansive working).|$|R
50|$|Exhalation will {{increase}} of bellows angle and {{will increase}} loading {{on the control}} spring, pushing the dosage <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> and allowing gas to flow into the dosage chamber until the increased pressure lifts the diaphragm and closes the valve again.|$|R
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>opens,</b> as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>open,</b> the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R
50|$|In a {{radial engine}} the {{cylinders}} are numbered around the circle, with the #1 cylinder at the top. There are always an odd {{number of cylinders}} in each bank, as this allows for a constant alternate cylinder firing order: for example, with a single bank of 7 cylinders, the order would be 1-3-5-7-2-4-6. Moreover, unless there is an odd number of cylinders, the ring cam around {{the nose of the}} engine would be unable to provide the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> - exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> sequence required by the four-stroke cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The Alfa Romeo Giulietta uses a {{new engine}} which {{utilizes}} a system known as Multiair. The system controls {{the amount of}} air going into the engine by controlling when air is allowed into the engine and how much the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> <b>opens.</b> The system works by inserting a [...] "tappet" [...] between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the [...] "tappet" [...] thus changing the effective opening profile of the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> The system can also change the overlap of the <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold {{which is used to}} increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a Start&Stop system and all are Euro5 rated.|$|R
50|$|Steam {{entry is}} usually {{controlled}} by poppet valves (which act similarly {{to those used}} in internal combustion engines) that are operated by a camshaft. The <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> <b>open</b> to admit steam when minimum expansion volume has been reached {{at the start of}} the stroke. For a period of the crank cycle, steam is admitted, and the poppet inlet is then closed, allowing continued expansion of the steam during the stroke, driving the piston. Near the end of the stroke, the piston will uncover a ring of exhaust ports mounted radially around the centre of the cylinder. These ports are connected by a manifold and piping to the condenser, lowering the pressure in the chamber below that of the atmosphere causing rapid exhausting. Continued rotation of the crank moves the piston. From the animation, the features of a uniflow engine can be seen, with a large piston almost half the length of the cylinder, poppet <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> at either end, a camshaft (whose motion is derived from that of the driveshaft) and a central ring of exhaust ports.|$|R
40|$|Variable {{camshaft}} phasing (VCP) {{system is}} a potential valvetrain technology for high speed engine applications since it does not increase the effective valve dynamic mass, which is essential to high speed operation.

As part of a general assessment on the VCP system, such an effect was calculated and analysed using a zero- and one- dimensional based commercial engine simulation package, Lotus Engineering Simulation (LES) and reported in this paper. The simulation was based on a 0. 6 l, 4 -cylinder, 4 -stroke, high speed (up to 13500 rpm), production spark ignition engine. It was found that IVO can either improve the utilisation of inlet charging effect or reduce backflow during the valve overlap period caused by speed related wave effects from the exhaust manifold...|$|R

5000|$|The {{business}} {{began as}} the Bonnick Cycle Company of Coventry, England. In 1890 during the pedal cycle craze that swept Britain {{at the end}} of the 19th century William Riley Jr. who had interests in the textile industry purchased the business and in 1896 incorporated a company to own it named The Riley Cycle Company Limited. Later, cycle gear maker Sturmey Archer was added to the portfolio. Riley's middle son, Percy, left school in the same year and soon began to dabble in automobiles. He built his first car at 16, in 1898, secretly, because his father did not approve. It featured the first mechanically operated <b>inlet</b> <b>valve.</b> By 1899, Percy Riley moved from producing motorcycles to his first prototype four-wheeled quadricycle. Little is known about Percy Riley's first [...] "motor-car". It is, however, well attested that the engine featured mechanically operated cylinder valves at a time when other engines depended on the vacuum effect of the descending piston to suck the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve(s)</b> <b>open.</b> That was demonstrated some years later when Benz developed and patented a mechanically operated <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> process of their own but were unable to collect royalties on their system from British companies; the courts were persuaded that the system used by British auto-makers was based on the one pioneered by Percy, which had comfortably anticipated equivalent developments in Germany. [...] In 1900, Riley sold a single three-wheeled automobile. Meanwhile, the elder of the Riley brothers, Victor Riley, although supportive of his brother's embryonic motor-car enterprise, devoted his energies to the core bicycle business.|$|R

A dynamic mesh CFD simulation has been conducted to represent the real movement of the piston and valves. The main advantage of the dynamic mesh modelling is that it provides the time history of individual flow realisations. Calculations included the inlet port and moving valves so that the flow field can be analysed in detail. The eddy viscosity k-ε RNG turbulence model was used throughout this study. The predicted results were validated against experimental LDA measurements. In this experiment, only air is inserted through the ports into an optically accessible cylinder. Velocity measurements were obtained at different crank-angles and cutting-planes for a standard spark ignition settings and valve lift. The maximum <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> lift is 8. 5 mm with a valve duration of 278 º. The maximum exhaust valve lift is 8 mm with a duration of 272 º. The <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> <b>open</b> (IVO), <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> close (IVC), exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>open</b> (EVO) and exhaust valves close (EVC) occured at - 29 º, 249 º, 490 º and 762 º respectively. The volume compression ratio is 10. 5. The engine bore is 80. 5 mm, the stroke is 88. 2 mm with a connecting rod length of 131 mm. In this paper, results are presented and discussed for the variation of turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity, kinetic energy and its dissipation rate during the intake and compression strokes at various crank-angle positions. The calculation results are in good agreement with the LDA measurements. Moreover, the results have revealed the formation of a strong tumble flow motion during the inlet stroke as well as the creation of a clockwise vortex {{at the bottom of the}} cylinder...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, an airship for the fixed point {{observation}} of “nara ” withering in village forests {{was designed and}} trial manufactured. The airship consists of a helium gas filling envelope of 4. 5 m in total length, propeller-driven motors, a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) {{in order to achieve}} longer flight, Ni-H batteries, a CCD camera observation system, and propeller control systems. Automatic charging device was designed to charge the Ni-H battery from the PEFC in the sky automatically. It controlls the power system by using a micro computer in a mannar where the electromagnetic valve supplying hydrogen is open to recover the output voltage of the PEFC when the voltage of Ni-H battery decreased to a certain level, resulting in energy charging to the Ni-H battery and keeping the rotation of the moter. The <b>opened</b> electromagnetic <b>valve</b> is closed when the Ni-H battery full charged. Furthermore, after a certain hours operation when the output voltahge of the PEFC drops due to accumulation of impurities in hydrogen gas, the outlet <b>valve</b> will be <b>opened</b> to exhaust hydrogen containing accumulated impurities.

In combination with this intake manifold design feature, the exhaust manifold design, as well as the exhaust valve opening time can be so calibrated as to achieve greater evacuation of the cylinder. The exhaust manifolds achieve a vacuum in the cylinder just before the piston reaches top dead center.

30|$|Three {{independent}} {{wind tunnel}} segments {{are connected to}} the downstream parts of the air diverter plenum. Three additional Kunkle 913 BFEM 03 pressure relief valves and a burst disk are additionally mounted on the air diverter plenum for pressure relief in the unlikely event of over-pressurization. A spectacle blind valve or a circular sliding gate valve is located at the inlet to each of the wind tunnel segments.

50|$|The {{very first}} {{internal}} combustion engines did not compress the mixture.

50|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{optimisation}} of the valve timing for differing engine speeds and loads, the system is able to vary the timing and duration of the <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> opening. It achieves this by using a complex and finely machined mechanism to drive the inlet camshafts. This mechanism can accelerate and decelerate the rotational speed of the camshaft during different parts of its cycle. e.g. to produce longer opening duration, it slows the rotation during the <b>valve</b> <b>open</b> part of the cycle and speeds it up during the valve closed period.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressurized}} steam <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> and {{low-pressure steam}} exhaust <b>valves</b> are <b>opened.</b> Pressurized steam from the boiler enters the top {{part of the}} cylinder above the piston, pushing it down, and the steam below the piston is drawn into the condenser, creating a vacuum below the piston.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in supercharging spark ignition engines operating on CNG (compressed natural gas) mainly due to its superior knock resisting properties. However, there is a penalty in volumetric efficiency when directly injecting the gaseous fuel at early and partial injection timings. The present work reports the combined effects of a small boost pressure and injection timing on performance and combustion of CNG fueled DI (direct injection) engine. The experimental tests were carried out on a 4 -stroke DI spark ignition engine with a compression ratio of 14. Early injection timing, when <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> are still <b>open</b> (at 300 °BTDC), and partial injection timing, in which part of the injection occurs after the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> are closed (at 180 °BTDC), were varied at each operating speed with variation of the boost pressure from 2. 5 to 10 kPa. A narrow angle injector (NAI) was used to increase the mixing rate at engine speeds between 2000 and 5000 rpm. Similar experiments were conducted on a naturally aspirated engine {{and the results were}} then compared with that of the boosting system to examine the combined effects of boost pressure and injection timing. It was observed that boost pressure above 7. 5 kPa resulted in an improvement of performance and combustion of CNG DI engine at all operating speeds. This was manifested in the faster heat release rates and mass fraction burned that in turn improved combustion efficiency of the boosting system. An increased in cylinder pressure and temperature was also observed with boost pressure compared to naturally aspirated engine. Moreover, the combustion duration was reduced due to concentration of the heat release near to the top dead center {{as the result of the}} boost pressure. Supercharging was also found to reduce the penalty of volumetric efficiency at both the simulated port and partial injection timings...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated a novel combustion {{system for}} {{gasoline direct injection}} spark ignition (DISI) engines. This combustion system burned an unthrottled, stoichiometric, homogenous charge at part load, {{in comparison to the}} unthrottled,lean, stratified charge burned by conventional DISI engines. Unthrottled homogeneous operation, enabled by the use of variable valve timing. allowed high fuel efficiencies to be achieved while addressing the particulate emissions, poor combustion stabilities and NOx after-treatment issues associated with stratified charge DISI engines, when compared to the port fuel injection (PFI) engines they are replacing. Experiments were performed to quantifY the bulk in-cylinder air motions, determine their effect on the fuel spray, and examine the resulting air-fuel mixture preparation of various early <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> closing (EIVC) and late <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> opening (LIVO) strategies that were suitable for controlling engine load under homogeneous engine conditions. A broad matrix of engine conditions has been investigated, with engine speeds ranging from idle (750 rpm) to 5000 rpm, and engine loads ranging from 2. 7 bar indicated mean effective pressure (!MEP) to wide open throttle (WOT). Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to record mean in-cylinder flow fields in the tumble and swirl planes for a range of engine conditions and valve profiles. This included measurements at higher engine speeds (3500 rpm) than previously published. Air flows in the difficult-to-access cylinder head were measured with Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and the effect of these air flows on the fuel spray produced by a latest generation multi-stream fuel injector was investigated with Mie imaging. The resulting mixture preparation was then investigated over a crank angle period ranging from the start ofinjection (SOl) to the time of spark with Laser Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIE F). Supporting data from a thermodynamic sister engine with identical combustion chamber geometry was recorded at University College London. Unthrottled, homogeneous operation with low lift EIVC valve profiles improved engine fuel consumption by up to 20 % compared to throttled operation with conventional, full-lift profiles. This was a consequence of a reduction in the throttling losses and improvements in air-fuel mixing. The intake air momentum was more significant than the fuel spray momentum from the injection system in determining the air-fuel mixing process. This resulted in engine performance being strongly affected by engine speed, intake valve lift and injection timing. The greatest benefits in ISFC occurred when only one of the two <b>inlet</b> <b>valves</b> was operated. This was attributed to an overall increase in the level ofin-cylinder swirl. However, the choice of which <b>inlet</b> <b>valve</b> was <b>opened</b> was critical, with greater gains occurring if the fuel spray from the centrally mounted injector was directed towards the spark plug than when the spray was directed away from the plug. EIVC combustion also exhibited significantly longer burn times than throttled operation. This was due to lower cylinder pressures that reduced the laminar flame speed and lower levels of turbulence around the spark plug at the time of ignition. Flame front measurements on the optical engine showed that during the longer early heat release phase (0 - 10 % mass fraction burned), the flame kernel was transported away from the spark plug and towards the combustion chamber wall beneath the <b>inlet</b> <b>valves.</b> Investigations into the fuel mixture preparation using Laser Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIE F) demonstrated that, under high load conditions, a source of particulate emissions from PFI engines was large droplets {{in the vicinity of the}} spark plug around the time of ignition. These fuel rich regions were precursors in the generation of soot and were all but eliminated with direct injection fuelling strategies. Late Intake <b>Valve</b> <b>Opening</b> (LIVO) <b>valve</b> strategies generated a sub-atmospheric cylinder pressure of between 0. 5 to 0. 3 bar (absolute). Spray images obtained under these conditions showed greater penetration of the fuel spray and a poorly defined spray cone boundary. Due to the increased momentum and increased shear forces of the inducted air, and the cylinder pressure falling below the saturation vapour pressure of some components of the gasoline fuel at the temperature of the mixture, flash evaporation of those components was seen to occur. The improvement in atomisation and faster burn rate with LIVO compensated to some extent for the increase in irrecoverable pumping work of this operating strategy over conventional EIVC. However, a practical disadvantage of LIVO was poor control of the trapped air mass, arising from the intake air momentum supercharging the engine cylinder at the conditions tested.
