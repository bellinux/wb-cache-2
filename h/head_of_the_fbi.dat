25|$|While the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{had paid}} {{informants}} in the Klan, {{for instance in}} Birmingham in the early 1960s, its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> J. Edgar Hoover, appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI's COINTELPRO program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups.|$|E
25|$|In the post-Cold War years, the FBI {{was worried}} more about {{possible}} Communist connections among anti-lynching groups {{than about the}} lynching crimes. For instance, the FBI branded Albert Einstein a communist sympathizer for joining Robeson's American Crusade Against Lynching. J. Edgar Hoover, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> for decades, was particularly fearful {{of the effects of}} Communism in the United States. He directed more attention to investigations of civil rights groups for communist connections than to Ku Klux Klan activities against the groups' members and other innocent blacks.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Gray was {{nominated}} as Hoover's permanent successor as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI.</b> This action by President Nixon confounded many, coming {{at a time}} when revelations of involvement by Nixon administration officials in the Watergate scandal were coming to the forefront. Under Gray's direction, the FBI had been accused of mishandling the investigation into the break-in, doing a cursory job and refusing to investigate the possible involvement of administration officials. Gray's Senate confirmation hearing was to become the Senate's first opportunity to ask pertinent questions about the Watergate investigation.|$|E
