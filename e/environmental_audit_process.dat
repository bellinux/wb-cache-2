40|$|While {{environmental}} legislation in Australia regulates tourism development, {{it is less}} effective in operational areas because of the dependency of tourism on environmental resources that are not managed by operators, and the small but incremental nature of operational impacts. The absence of functional environmental standards for tourism means that little guidance exists: a problem compounded by variability in the diversity of operation types and receiving environments, {{as well as the}} accessibility of information by a non-technical audience. While legislation and economic considerations may provide impetus to adopt environmental practices, it is proposed that an environmental philosophy is necessary for tourism businesses to seek out and maintain alternative sustainable modes of operation. Review of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> <b>process</b> used by a Queensland resort suggests commitment to continual improvement in environmental performance is attributable to individual and corporate ethics. While the case is an ecotourism operation, the literature indicates that these factors have relevance to tourism generally. Although client satisfaction and return on investment objectives are constraints, environmental auditing can provide impetus for practical expression of environmental objectives. Facilitation of ethically-motivated voluntary action may be more effective in achieving tourism 2 ̆ 7 s environmental objectives than codifying standards in static legislation...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two case histories of wastewater quality management in underground coal mines in the I 1 lawarra region. The first investigation briefly presents an analysis of mine water discharge having an extremely high concentration of suspended solids and consistently high barium concentrations, averaging 14. 4 mg/l Barium, over the sampling period. A laboratory study of chemical precipitation processes has indicated that about 91 % of barium could be removed by using ferric sulphate and lime. On {{the basis of the}} information obtained from the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> <b>process</b> an alternative water treatment and reuse system incorporating 51 % reduction in the water consumption with 32 % less off-site discharge has been suggested (Thomas, 1995). The second case history {{is concerned with}} the storm water management at a mine situated in the Illawarra escarpment where only 20 % of the wastewater generated in the colliery is discharged off -site. Computer modelling of the storm water system showed that 75 % of the clean runoff becomes contaminated through poor management practices and causes the process wastewater treatment system to fail in wet weather. Suggested improvements include relatively simple alteration to the coal wash filtration dams which are expected to reduce the periods of inefficient operation of these dams by 95 %. The use of storm water diversion channels and detention basins can reduce the overflow volumes by 70 - 100 % for a ten year ARI (Average Recurrence Interval) storm event (Wingrove 1996) ...|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{there are}} an {{increasing}} number of policy and legislative drivers for a more sustainable approach to the management of natural resources {{as well as for the}} mitigation of environmental health risks. However, despite significant progress in recent years, there is still some way to go to achieve circularity of process, as well as risk mitigation within organisations. Using a case study of the Gardone Val Trompia hospital in northern Italy, this manuscript offers a novel holistic examination of strategies to enhance resource efficiency and environmental health within a key sector, i. e. the healthcare sector. Through the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> and <b>process</b> flow mapping, trends in waste and wastewater arisings and the associated financial and environmental costs and risks were identified. Recommendations for developing more resource efficient approaches as well as mitigating the environmental and public health risks are suggested.

Many companies and auditors find these useful {{and there are several}} such protocol systems commercially available.

There is a long standing debate among <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> professionals on the value of large, highly detailed and prescriptive protocols (i.e., that can, in theory, be completed by an auditor with little or no technical experience) versus more flexible protocols that rely on the expertise and knowledge of experienced auditors and source documents (regulations, permits, etc.) directly. However usage of structured and prescriptive protocols in ISO 14001 audits allows easier review by other parties, either internal to the Certification Body (e.g. technical reviewers and certification managers) or external (accreditation bodies).|$|R

40|$|This {{review of}} the {{literature}} on <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and the potential role of accountants distinguishes between compliance audits and <b>audits</b> of the <b>environmental</b> management system. After an extensive introduction to the concept, this review focuses on the similarities and differences between an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> and a financial statement <b>audit.</b> Except that <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> are largely unregulated, the general approach to both types of audits is similar. Both audits place an emphasis on the evaluation of control systems, which is an argument in favor of external auditors playing a role in <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> Another argument for including external accountants, is their code of ethics. However, these professionals seem to be reluctant to enter the field of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing.</b> It is argued that this reluctance is {{because of a lack of}} generally accepted principles for conducting <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> If external accountants are engaged in <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> they should be part of multidisciplinary teams that also include scientists and engineers to avoid a too strong focus on procedures.

40|$|The Swedish {{government}} decided in 1996 that the governmental authorities are to implemement environmental management systems. Each year, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency compiles the authorities’ reports on their environmental management systems. The compilation shows that {{not more than}} 20 % of the authorities perform <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> This study aims to investigate the authorities’ view of internal <b>environmental</b> <b>audits,</b> the incentives of performing them. It also investigates if the <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> contribute to continuous improvements. The study is {{a case study of}} nine participating authorities that all reported to have performed <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> in 2005.

40|$|Purpose - The {{main purpose}} {{in this article}} is to {{highlight}} civil society activism that resulted in the inception of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> in the United States in the 1970 s. The General Motors (GM) campaign which is discussed in this article led towards major institutional changes for the implementation of corporate social responsibility (environmental) reporting originally referred to as social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission&# 039;s (SEC) role and actions are analysed in detail in order to highlight the direction of this Federal Agency in relation to the implementation of social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of literature from the early 1970 s is undertaken in order to identify the inception of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and the types of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> as social auditing in its early stages. The case of the GM campaign is analysed in order to highlight the forms of historical institutionalism relevant to the critical stage of exogenous influences on companies to undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Findings - It is found that in the early 1970 s companies resisted the incorporation of corporate social responsibility initiatives and actions as part of their agendas. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Auditing</b> as a type of social auditing at that time referred to corporate social responsibility disclosures that included environmental disclosures. Due to public pressure and civil society activism companies had to adopt and undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The initial stages of environmental disclosures included reporting on environmental expenses and liabilities of the companies. The SEC imposed minimal disclosure requirements for <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> which were nevertheless adequate to undertake action against companies found to be providing misleading environmental information in their publicly available disclosures...|$|R

40|$|New {{international}} standards for <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> {{are now being}} actively promoted by public authorities and adopted by private firms. One important feature of these standards is their emphasis on managerial systems and incentives that support a wiser use of environmental resources. This paper studies such a system, in which incentive compensation may be {{based in part on}} the results of an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit.</b> It is found that optimal wages after an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> is performed should have a greater range than wages paid when no audit has occurred. It is also shown that the decision to conduct an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> {{and the size of the}} expected wage in this case depend crucially on whether the agent's prudence (or precautionary motives) dominates or not his aversion to risk. It is finally found that the insertion of <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> within current management systems would certainly induce a manager to care more about the environment; although this may come at the expense of less concern for other activities, we find plausible circumstances in which properly designed <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> overcome such a trade-off and increase the manager's attention to both environmental and traditional tasks.

This <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> report of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> will serve as a revision to the existing EMS and will thus update it. The focus of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> was on the sensitive environment adjacent to the roadway, and all structures, road camps, dams, borrow pits, and environmental policies related to it. In order to conduct the audit, it was necessary to: review the existing EMS and other documentation (e. g. minutes of site meetings) related to the construction of the upgraded road; conduct field studies of the present condition of the environment on either side of the length of the roadway; and conduct interviews with key personnel from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, and of the GGHNP. The findings of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> reveal that the existing EMS was not completely implemented during the construction and post-completion phases of the roadway.
