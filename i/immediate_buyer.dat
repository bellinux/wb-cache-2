50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{attached to}} London and Continental Railways were for {{operations of the}} Nightstar international sleeper services. Introduction of the sleeper services were delayed and then fully cancelled. During 2000, Eurostar (UK) Ltd. offered their seven Class 92 members (92020-21, 32, 40, 44-46) for sale—being surplus to requirements. No <b>immediate</b> <b>buyer</b> could be found, so the locomotives were decommissioned and stored at Crewe International electric depot.|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} Washington law pertaining to a seller 2 ̆ 7 s obligations {{to a remote}} purchaser {{with respect to the}} quality of goods, attending in particular to the judicially created exceptions to the privity requirement. 20 Part II explores the reasons a seller may provide and a buyer may purchase a warranty, reasons that bear on resolution of the question whether the privity requirement should be retained. Parts III and IV analyze not only what warranty obligations a seller may have to a remote purchaser but also the theoretical bases for those obligations {{and the manner in which}} those obligations may be excluded, modified, or disclaimed. Part V considers a number of arguments in favor of abolishing the privity requirement and demonstrates that the arguments do not merit the requirement 2 ̆ 7 s abrogation and that privity of contract is appropriate for a proper allocation of loss among a seller, its <b>immediate</b> <b>buyer,</b> and a remote buyer. Finally, the article concludes that seller liability to a remote buyer should exist, subject to the ability of a seller to create contractual rights in a remote buyer under U. C. C. section 1 - 103 (b), 21 only where the seller has made an express commitment to the buyer or where the remote buyer is a third-party beneficiary of a contract of sale between the remote seller and its intermediate buyer under established contract principles. Consistent with this conclusion, the article further maintains that the ability of a seller to make an express warranty to a remote buyer should be enhanced by eliminating the requirement that a buyer be aware of a representation prior to purchase in order to be able to enforce the representation as an express warranty...|$|E

50|$|South America as an {{emerging}} market {{has yet to}} see popularization of new purchasing models such as group buying. First intermediaries appeared recently in Brazil with slightly different business models than those proposed in Europe. Notably, the difference is in the way volume discount is achieved, as a post-purchase rebate instead of an instant discount, allowing for an <b>immediate</b> <b>buyer's</b> purchase. Major criticism for such model is in the lack of aggregation and unfit differentiation between buyers - those that wish to purchase immediately at any price {{and those that are}} willing to sacrifice time for discounts, eventually costing the vendor potential profits. In Colombia, Groupon was launched in July 2010 and, within one year, the largest media companies of the country launched their own group buying websites Cuponidad, QueBuenaCompra and Downtown Colombia, proving there is market for several big players.|$|R
50|$|Five years ago, {{after the}} {{disastrous}} boat party, Michael {{returns to the}} family following his mother's arrest. But when he learns that his parents had received economic stimulus money, and once again embezzled it instead of investing it in the Bluth company, Michael attempts to finally disassociate himself from the family by selling his stock to Lucille 2. He also decides to build houses at Sudden Valley under his own company, Michael B., {{despite the lack of}} roads leading into the complex. Having no <b>immediate</b> <b>buyers,</b> Michael again approaches Lucille 2 to secure a loan of $700,000 until residents move in. But due to the 2007 housing bubble, all chances of getting any houses sold evaporate and Michael winds up living in a ghost town. When the mailman, Pete, his only link to the outside world, dies from a heart attack one morning, Michael moves in with his son, George Michael (Michael Cera), at UC Irvine.|$|R
40|$|An {{engineering}} methodology {{to identify}} profitable market segments {{for the use}} of new materials is presented and illustrated by application to the automobile industry. The method has three parts: empirical, statistical and analytical. The first measures company preferences for the important attributes of a use of a material, applying single-attribute utility functions. The second identifies market segments, by determining significant differences between measured preferences with t-tests. The third estimates the premium these market segments would pay for a product made of a new material, using multiattribute utilities, and thus determines profitable market segments. The case study of valve trains containing ceramic components defined two market segments: companies with either a broad world market or a narrow specialty. The <b>immediate</b> <b>buyers</b> of these valve trains are likely to be producers of high-value, six-cylinder automobiles, who seem prepared to pay a significant premium for this product.

30|$|A {{supply network}} is created when {{companies}} {{buy and sell}} goods to each other, transferring necessary parts downstream to create a final product. Often, companies do not have visibility beyond their <b>immediate</b> <b>buyers</b> and suppliers, which results that these networks are not designed but emerge [10]. These networks can become large scale, with many thousands of companies becoming interdependent without their knowledge of being so. Due to these interdependencies, disruptions in the network can cascade, and the implications can be catastrophic. For example, the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake caused the Japanese auto industry to temporarily shut down, forcing European and North American manufacturers to halt production as their inventories from Japan were exhausted. Goldman Sachs estimated that the shutdowns cost Japanese automakers 200 million USD a day [17]. Daily global automotive production dropped by one-third, resulting in an overall loss of 5 million vehicles worldwide, out of the 72 million planned for 2011 (~ 7  % loss). Both in terms of risk management for the entire network, and {{from the perspective of}} individual firms planning and coordinating with different suppliers, a better understanding of interdependencies would help create better strategies for robustness.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{supply chain}} performance {{from the perspective}} of smallholders. It draws on Transaction Cost Economics to develop a model explaining dyadic relationships between smallholders and their buyers. The model extends the traditional vertical coordination continuum to incorporate missing dyads and informal markets. It aims to identify factors that constrain marketing choices available to smallholders, limiting the chain’s robustness from their perspective. The model is used to analyse the supply chain for organic fresh vegetables in Kathmandu, Nepal, and to derive policy recommendations from the analysis. This chain is characterised mainly by relational contracting between smallholders and their <b>immediate</b> <b>buyers.</b> There was also evidence of vertical integration by some buyers, and of growers selling on informal markets. However, {{there was no evidence of}} spot market trading or of conventional contracting. Despite this, the chain offered smallholders a range of dyads with different risk-reward trade-offs. It is concluded that government agencies could play a key role in building a more robust chain by helping these parties to deepen and extend their relational contracts, by establishing standards and rules for organic produce traded in municipal spot markets, and by facilitating farmer marketing groups and advising them on production plans, technology and participatory guarantee systems. The government could also improve physical infrastructure, mandate extension staff to facilitate and witness contracts, and provide contractual parties with easy access to legal recourse for small claims...|$|R
50|$|As {{personal}} mobile devices {{become more}} capable and widespread, the marketing research industry {{will look to}} further capitalize on this trend. Mobile devices present the perfect channel for research firms to retrieve <b>immediate</b> impressions from <b>buyers</b> and to provide their clients with a holistic view of the consumers within their target markets, and beyond. Now, more than ever, innovation {{is the key to}} success for Marketing Researchers. Marketing Research Clients are beginning to demand highly personalized and specifically-focused products from the marketing research firms; big data is great for identifying general market segments, but is less capable of identifying key factors of niche markets, which now defines the competitive edge companies are looking for in this mobile-digital age.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} was made to {{determine}} the adequacy of Montana’s hay production relative to hay needs, describe the hay marketing practices within the present market structure, determine the relationship between hay prices and marketing factors, and consider the best way of evaluating hay for market purposes. The annual production of hay in Montana is not enough to adequately {{meet the needs of the}} livestock industry, but very little hay is imported into the state, because of adjustments in hay use and the extent of shifting to alternative feeds. Hay buyers did not reflect through prices paid any significant importance to quality, kind, or cutting of hay. Hay is sold mostly in local markets, within a 15 to 20 mile radius by farmer-growers, to buyers who prefer to purchase hay at the time of <b>immediate</b> need. Neither <b>buyers</b> nor sellers have adequate market information to guide them in their transactions. Sampling hay with a core sampler and analyzing the sample chemically is superior to the use of United States Grades as a method of evaluating hay...|$|R
