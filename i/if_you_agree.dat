500|$|Fiasco {{is noted}} for his anti-establishment views. In an {{interview}} with Stephen Colbert on the satirical news show The Colbert Report, Fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: [...] "You should criticize power even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with it." [...] In another interview in June 2011 on the CBS program What's Trending, Fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, [...] "My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, {{the root cause of}} terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists." [...] He additionally criticized Obama for his stance on the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. [...] In keeping with his anti-establishment views, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections. On January 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of [...] "Words I Never Said", which contains anti-Obama lyrics, in Washington D.C., during Obama's second presidential inauguration. In June 2015, Lupe Fiasco wrote an open letter about white supremacy.|$|E

6000|$|BOHUN (again {{interrupting}} him). My {{specialty is}} being right when {{other people are}} wrong. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> with me I should be of no use here. (He nods at him to drive the point home; then turns suddenly and forcibly on Crampton.) Now you, Mr. Crampton: what point in this business have you most at heart? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, my dear, I {{would advise}} you to tell the young man that, as neither of you have means of your own, the thing must be at an end. It is the only step for <b>you</b> to take. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> to wait, one of you might die, or his money might never be forth coming, or you might see {{somebody}} else that you liked better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come--no taunts, Eustacia, or {{we shall}} quarrel. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>agree</b> {{to go with}} me, and agree shortly, I shall go by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mis' Weber gave me back ninety cents. Now I'll {{turn over}} seventy-five of it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> {{not to show}} up at aunt Dorcas's until three o'clock to-morrow afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 296. Under what {{circumstances}} did Mr. Mill think nascent states might {{be justified in}} adopting a policy of protection? Criticise his opinion, and, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with it, give some examples of its application.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{question}} about persuadin' that idiotic squire to give all hands a few hours' liberty, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to return here as soon as the performance is ended," [...] the manager began.|$|E
5000|$|A 2003 {{interview}} at the University of Sussex is the likely inspiration for Richard Dawkins' famous quote [...] "Science is interesting and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>you</b> can fuck off".|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Claude, laughing, [...] "I've two prices, ore's two hundred, and {{the other}} is just nothing; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>agree</b> to the one, you must take the other." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{critical}} {{reviews of}} World in Motion were lukewarm. Music critic William Rulhmann wrote [...] "Except for the gloomy viewpoint, {{it was hard}} to recognize the Jackson Browne of his first few albums amid all the commentary, and even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agreed</b> with his overall political stance, that was disappointing." [...] Critic Robert Christgau commented that the best songs were the ones Browne did not write. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Steven Van Zandt's 'I Am a Patriot' is the only truly memorable song on Browne's trilogy of protest albums." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} navigation, I fancy, Master Burns," [...] said Swinton to Paul, [...] "but {{as you can}} set broken bones, {{and things}} of that sort, we will spare you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to serve us." ...|$|E

60|$|MRS. H. I {{tell you}} quite plainly: I will only consent to holding my tongue about her, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to Hornblower being told. It's a scandal {{to have a}} woman {{like that in the}} neighbourhood.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} nobleman, rising and laying down the oyster, [...] "I {{ought to know}} {{something}} more definite about your antecedents before succouring <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> couldn't <b>agree</b> with your mistress, you are probably no better than you should be." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do not go," [...] she said; [...] "do not be angry. Forget that I laughed. Now perhaps I {{can help}} you.

6000|$|... "I {{see some}} hope, sir," [...] he said, [...] "of inclining {{the heart of}} this woman to {{religious}} belief, before it is too late. Will you read my report, and say <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! father," [...] {{returned}} the boy, remonstratively, [...] "you are severe. However, I will take one, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> {{to leave your}} woollen comforter behind. You won't need that, you see, as long as I am with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such, gentlemen, is {{the theory}} of the prosecution. You will, of course, weigh it {{carefully}} in your minds, and it will be your duty, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with it, to give expression to your opinion in your verdict." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes. Not that he {{has settled}} anything, but {{he has made a}} {{proposition}} to which I am willing to agree. I don't go up to town to-morrow, and we will talk it over. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> to it, all the money difficulties will be settled." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aye, because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> lads had <b>agreed</b> upon {{getting into}} the town by the same route as you have been doing, I should have set off by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess this}} isn't any more use, now," [...] said Corny, [...] "as we've done {{all we can}} for kings and queens, but Rectus says that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> I can have it for my {{autograph}} book. I never had a governor's signature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm no more a South Sea {{islander}} {{than you}} are, lads, {{but this is}} not the time for explanations. It's enough for you to know, in the meantime, that I'm an Englishman, and will befriend you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to obey me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have; and {{it shall}} be moulded like wax to your {{slightest}} wishes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> to do me justice; but not granite, nor aught else that nature has of hardest, will be more inflexible if you continue an useless opposition!--Clara Mowbray, I am your Fate." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But, dear one," [...] she said, {{with such}} spiritual {{intensity}} that {{her eyes were}} like pole stars, [...] "it is I who wish it. And {{it is not for}} myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right. <b>If</b> he disagrees <b>you</b> may do as you will. Nay, more <b>if</b> <b>you</b> all <b>agree,</b> later <b>you</b> are absolved from the promise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for vigorous action, at least as regards me, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>agree</b> to forget your suspicions for a few minutes, {{and listen to what}} I have got to say.

6000|$|... "Now, Master Trench," [...] said Swinton, [...] "we are no pirates.

6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} for you all," [...] he said, [...] "in order {{that you might}} arrange among yourselves which two shall go. Therefore do you settle the matter, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>agree,</b> then cast lots and leave it to fortune.

6000|$|... "But so {{much depends}} upon it; {{and he is}} so stern. Of course, I wish well for both of you. There is plenty enough,--plenty; <b>if</b> only <b>you</b> could <b>agree</b> together." ...|$|R
