5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can <b>die,</b> <b>a</b> condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).|$|E
5|$|The Prose Edda and Heimskringla both {{report that}} Gefjon plowed away {{what is now}} lake Mälaren, Sweden, and with this land formed the island of Zealand, Denmark. In addition, the Prose Edda {{describes}} {{that not only is}} Gefjon a virgin herself, but that all who <b>die</b> <b>a</b> virgin become her attendants. Heimskringla records that Gefjon married the legendary Danish king Skjöldr and that the two dwelled in Lejre, Denmark.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a number of lives upon {{starting}} the game, and should they <b>die</b> <b>a</b> gravestone will appear at their location and stay in place as long as the player has lives left. Health can be replenished by collecting food scattered throughout the castle, however it will constantly drop the more the player moves, thus the player may eventually lose a life from starvation if they have not escaped the castle in time.|$|E
25|$|Huang {{became very}} {{well-known}} in Parisian salons. In 1713, Huang married a Parisian woman named Marie-Claude Regnier. In 1715, {{she gave birth}} to a healthy daughter, also named Marie-Claude, but the mother <b>died</b> <b>a</b> few days later. Discouraged, Huang himself <b>died</b> <b>a</b> year and a half later, and their daughter <b>died</b> <b>a</b> few months after that.|$|R

5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and <b>die</b> <b>a</b> few weeks after mating.|$|E
5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over two years}} and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to <b>die</b> <b>a</b> heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to <b>die.</b> <b>A</b> relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
50|$|Early in 1900 he {{was forced}} by ill-health to resign his professorship, and <b>died</b> <b>a</b> few months later. Sidgwick, who <b>died</b> <b>an</b> agnostic, is buried in Terling All Saints Churchyard, Terling, Essex, with his wife.|$|R

5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to <b>die</b> <b>a</b> bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae <b>die.</b> <b>A</b> sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
5|$|Live and Let <b>Die,</b> <b>a</b> film based loosely on {{the novel}} {{starring}} Roger Moore as Bond, was released in 1973, which played on the cycle of blaxploitation films produced at the time. The film was directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and is the eighth in the Eon Productions Bond series. Some scenes from the novel were depicted in later Bond films, including the sequence of Bond and Solitaire being dragged behind Mr Big's boat, which {{was used in the}} film For Your Eyes Only, while Felix Leiter was not fed to a shark until Licence to Kill, which also faithfully adapts Live and Let Dies shoot-out in the warehouse.|$|E
50|$|DWARF uses a data {{structure}} called a Debugging Information Entry (DIE) to represent each variable, type, procedure, etc. <b>A</b> <b>DIE</b> has <b>a</b> tag (e.g., DW_TAG_variable, DW_TAG_pointer_type, DW_TAG_subprogram) and attributes (key-value pairs). <b>A</b> <b>DIE</b> can have nested (child) <b>DIEs,</b> forming <b>a</b> tree structure. <b>A</b> <b>DIE</b> attribute {{can refer to}} another DIE anywhere in the tree—for instance, <b>a</b> <b>DIE</b> representing <b>a</b> variable would have a DW_AT_type entry pointing to the DIE describing the variable's type.|$|R

5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with the villain and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair. The villain's retreat can be a private island (Dr. No, The Man with the Golden Gun), underwater (The Spy Who Loved Me), mountaintop retreat (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only) volcano (You Only Live Twice), or underground base (Live and Let <b>Die),</b> <b>a</b> ship (Thunderball, Tomorrow Never Dies), an oil rig (Diamonds Are Forever) or even a space station (Moonraker)—among other variations. Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, the villain or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or <b>die.</b> <b>A</b> few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources on a man who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to <b>die</b> <b>a</b> heroic death on the eighth day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of Melvin Van Peebles' film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, he premiered two musicals on Broadway, Don't Play Us Cheap and Ain't Supposed To <b>Die</b> <b>A</b> Natural Death, {{deriving}} from earlier plays he had written in French. To express the ghetto's turmoil and pathos, Van Peebles used sprechgesang as a form he could tell stories in; he recorded three albums using this style, Brer Soul, Ain't Supposed To <b>Die</b> <b>a</b> Natural Death and As Serious as a Heart-Attack. The albums were categorized as spoken word at the time, but was later called a precursor to rapping and hip hop music.|$|E
