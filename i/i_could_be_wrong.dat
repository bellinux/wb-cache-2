But just as I was about to march the news came that a party of Imperialist horse, three hundred strong, was about to attack Mansfeld, a place of whose existence I had never heard; but hearing that its count was a staunch Protestant, and that the inhabitants intended to make a stout defence, I thought that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> doing <b>wrong</b> {{in the service of the}} king by marching to aid them, the place being but twenty-four miles away across the hills.

As the place is a small one, with but about two hundred and fifty fighting men of all ages, we deemed it impossible to defend the town, and while they were breaching the walls fell back to the castle. The Imperialists occupied it at sunset, and at night, leaving a party to hold the castle, we sallied out from the other side, and marching round, entered by the breaches, and, raising the Swedish war cry fell upon the enemy, who were for the most part too drunk to offer any serious resistance.

This interview with Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, alleged leader of the Jemaah Islamiyah organization, was conducted on August 13 and 15, 2005 from Cipinang Prison in Jakarta.

Excerpts from the interview are below; click here to read the full interview. Q. In your personal view, {{what do you think of}} bombings in our homeland, namely the Bali, Marriott and Kuningan bombings? A. I call those who carried out these actions all mujahid. They all had a good intention, that is, Jihad in Allah's way, the aim of the jihad is to look for blessing from Allah. They are right that America is the proper target because America fights Islam. So in terms of their objectives, they are right, and the target of their attacks was right also. But their calculations are debatable. My view is that we should do bombings in conflict areas not in peaceful areas. We have to target the place of the enemy, not countries where many Muslims live. Q. What do you mean by “wrong calculation,” that the victims included Muslims? A. That was one them. In my calculation, if there are bombings in peaceful areas, this will cause fitnah [discord] and other parties will be involved. This is my opinion and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong.</b> Yet I still consider them mujahid. If they made mistakes, they are only human beings who can be wrong.

40|$|Some Nest Box Observations. The {{following}} are some observations on nests of species who use bluebird boxes in the Gering area. Anyone else working on a bluebird project {{who would like to}} add their observations in a future NBR is invited to do so. Bluebirds make a nest that consists primarily of grasses.

As far as I know {{there is no way to}} tell the difference between Mountain and Eastern Bluebird nests, and we do have both species here-could even have hybrids, I suppose. Chickadees have the neatest nest that is rather flat but very soft, made of a lot of mosses and animal fur and hair. Again, seldom a feather. Then there is the House Wren. From what I have read, the male arrives first and fills available holes full of sticks. Then the female arrives and picks the site she wants. She may build the actual nest on top of the sticks, or she may take all of the sticks out and start over again-even using the same sticks. So we find a lot oj houses with what I call 2 ̆ 7 dummy nests 2 ̆ 7 that are just a bunch of sticks. Sometimes the whole house is full and some of the sticks are surprisingly large-you wonder how the bird can manage to get the stick into the right position to get it into the hole.

40|$|This {{appears to}} be a very 2 ̆ 2 {{personal}} 2 ̆ 2 book. Robert V. Hine 2 ̆ 7 s motive in writing it evidently stemmed not from any historiographical issuea gap in the literature, for example-but simply out of a fascination with the commune movement of the 1960 s and 1970 s. What was there of the true communal impulse, he asked himself, in the westward movement? His answer: not much. This apparently will surprise today 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 commune people, 2 ̆ 2 who look to the American pioneer experience for community models. One suspects that it will surprise few historians. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> and for those who find the question of interest, Hine provides a lengthy elaboration. He begins by juxtaposing the views of Frederick J. Turner, Josiah Royce, and Daniel Boorstin, who agreed that precious little sense of community was to be found on the frontier and who disagreed only in evaluating this fact. Hine then calls on sociology for some definitions of community. Finally, he escorts the reader through time in a survey of frontier groups that-under the relentless onslaught of individualism, materialism, geographic mobility, and other disintegrative aspects of frontier life-failed to muster or maintain true community. Chapters 3 through 9 are each devoted to one such group: New England Puritans, cattle drovers and wagon train members, miners, farmers, townspeople, ranchers and their employees, immigrants and blacks, members of cooperative colonies. All groups, sooner or later, succumbed to the dominant spirit of the frontier. There is nothing here seemingly provocative of useful scholarly debate, but I would nevertheless raise two substantive questions. First, the author 2 ̆ 7 s failure to offer some sensible working definition of frontier is more than of trivial import, since his argument asserts that the frontier was distinctively subversive of community values. But this cannot logically be proven, disproven, or even (in my opinion) very intelligently discussed so long as the author refuses to disentangle the frontier from the rest of America. How is the conscientious reader to separate (1) social destruction wrough t by the frontier from (2) the destructive spirit of American culture at large? Such a separation is clearly essential if the author wishes to be taken seriously. Hine variously collapses or expands the frontier as it suits his purpose, but it is a little difficult to see whether his begging the question of definition is conscious or naive. A case in point: on pages 97 and 134 he cites high population turnover among Midwestern farmers and townspeople as another important datum proving the lethal nature of the frontier spirit on true community. Only in a footnote does he briefly acknowledge that historians have found tire same high turnover rates in virtually every American population unit yet studied-eastern as well as western, urban as well as frontier, countryside and town, the 1850 s as well as the 1890 s. Yet Hine 2 ̆ 7 s exceptionally subtle disclaimer-that the frontier was the same as every place else when it came to geographic mobility-is blithely ignored for the next 160 pages as he continues to lament the special impact of frontier mobility on community...|$|E
