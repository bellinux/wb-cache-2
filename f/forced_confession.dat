25|$|Their most {{influential}} leader, László Rajk, who was minister {{of foreign affairs}} at the time, was arrested in May 1949. He was accused of rather surreal crimes, such as spying for Western imperialist powers and for Yugoslavia (which was also a Communist country, but in very bad relations with the Soviet Union at the time). At his trial in September 1949, he made a <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> to be an agent of Miklós Horthy, Leon Trotsky, Josip Broz Tito and Western imperialism. He also {{admitted that he had}} taken part in a murder plot against Mátyás Rákosi and Ernő Gerő. Rajk was found guilty and executed. In the next three years, other leaders of the party deemed untrustworthy, such as former Social Democrats or other Hungarian illegal Communists such as János Kádár, were also arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges.|$|E

A report from April 2010 stated the [...] "use of harsh interrogation techniques and <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> of guilt by the Afghan National Police and the National Directorate of Security was documented, {{including the use of}} electric shocks and beating", against juvenile detainees suspected of being involved in insurgency. This became concerning after a briefing note to Peter MacKay stated that many juvenile detainees were arrested by the CF, and transferred to the NDS, as per CF policy for all detainees under the age of 18. It also stated juvenile detainees were being kept in a Canadian transfer facility in Kandahar for [...] "a significant period." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{concerns}} for his health, Tam-Baryoh apparently signed a confession to ensure {{his release from}} the prison, engineered by a committee made up of his lawyer, 2 journalists and a peace studies lecturer of the University of Sierra Leone. Rightsway International, an independent human rights group, has condemned President Koroma for allegedly dictating to the committee about obtaining the confession. A statement later released by the group read:"Rightsway is disappointed that Tam Baryoh's <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> has been published widely by pro-government media outlets and social networks. The publication of forced confessions {{is often used to}} discredit dissident news and information providers. This is a media propaganda tool used by dictatorial regimes, to avoid being exposed, investigated and punished for the grave violations of human rights." ...|$|E

He also briefly held a paid slot presenting on Iran's state-funded broadcaster Press TV, a decision criticised particularly after the broadcaster was censured by OFCOM for broadcasting a <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> from a Tehran jail. Corbyn has since said that he used his Press TV role to address “human rights issues”, however full records of Press TV shows don't exist anymore, and Business Insider says it is [...] "not possible to say that Corbyn never raised human rights issues on any of his Press TV appearances". Oliver Kamm, of The Times, however claims that, when Kamm was on Press TV, Corbyn never raised these issues.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly thereafter, in March 1938, {{he was put}} {{on trial}} along with Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Krestinsky and other Old Bolsheviks, on charges of conspiring with Trotsky to {{overthrow}} Stalin, the third Moscow Show Trial—known as the Trial of the Twenty One. In his <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> to Andrey Vyshinsky, he admitted to all the charges—including having been a spy (for Japan) and a landowner. He made attempts {{to point out that}} his revenue had been used to support socialism, and that he had a grasp of [...] "revolutionary practices", but was attacked by Vyshinsky, who persistently referred to Rakovsky as [...] "a counterrevolutionary". In his final statement, Rakovsky argued: [...] "from my young days I honestly, truthfully and devotedly performed my duty as a soldier of the cause of the emancipation of labor. After this bright period a dark period set in, the period of my criminal deeds".|$|E
2500|$|The legal {{shift away}} from {{widespread}} use of torture and <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> dates to turmoil of the late 16th and early 17th century in England. Anyone refusing to take the oath ex officio mero (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty. Suspected Puritans were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel [...] "cooperation." [...] Puritans, {{who were at the}} time fleeing to the New World, began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case John Lilburne refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for [...] "freeborn rights" [...] were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. Oliver Cromwell's revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the Levellers. The Levellers presented The Humble Petition of Many Thousands to Parliament in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.|$|E

6000|$|Having learned such precautions, Martin {{consulted}} [...] "The Duchess" [...] for tone, {{and proceeded}} to mix according to formula. The formula consists of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells. The third part was an unvarying quantity, but {{the first and second}} parts could be varied an infinite number of times. Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by <b>forced</b> <b>confession</b> of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl's heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly. It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited, and Martin discovered, bit by bit, other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses. But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with; though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell, the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same. In quantity, the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose, fifteen hundred words maximum dose.|$|E
