5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents.

5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta {{appointed}} new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Alexander Moorcroft, a physician, had it named after {{him because he was}} the first white man to brave the conditions and build his cabin here, <b>in</b> open <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sioux Indians who inhabited this rangeland about 1890 - 1895.|$|R

5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for Freetown, where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at Freetown on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} court through the Old Court-New Court controversy, Chief Justice Boyle {{resigned}} in 1826. In December 1828, Mills and Owsley also resigned. Their resignations were {{an attempt to}} silence criticism from the defeated New Court faction that they held their seats <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will of the people. Old Court supporters hoped both men would be re-nominated and re-confirmed by the legislature, making the New Court's charge less credible. Accordingly, newly elected governor Thomas Metcalfe submitted both men to the legislature for confirmation, but the nominations were defeated in the state senate. Thus ended Owsley's tenure on the court. It was, at the time, the longest tenure of any Court of Appeals justice except John Boyle. Owsley returned to his legal practice, and his case load soon compelled him to move to Frankfort.|$|E

50|$|During the crisis, the dacha was {{draped in}} red and black flags, and armed workers came and went. Numerous {{meetings}} were held in the garden. Anarchist speakers urged that all orders and decrees, whether from the Provisional Government or the Soviet, be ignored. The anarchists remained entrenched <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dacha, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, when he refused to step down after a disputed 2007 election, <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{federal government and the}} AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} fell briefly under British rule {{during the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable {{things from the}} half-built parish. <b>In</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city. As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders {{did not attempt to}} enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort. The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|In 1613, {{his sister}} Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{and moved to}} Heidelberg. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia. The {{following}} year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors. In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose as their monarch FrederickV, who was leader of the Protestant Union, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor {{marked the beginning of}} the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants. In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands. James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's {{image and}} memory are best understood.

500|$|Voormann's aim was {{to reflect}} the radical {{departure}} in sound represented particularly by [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", and his choice of a black-and-white cover was <b>in</b> deliberate <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preference for vivid colour. When he submitted his work to the Beatles, Epstein wept, overjoyed that Voormann had managed to capture <b>the</b> experimental tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beatles' new music. Voormann also designed a series of four images, titled [...] "Wood Face", [...] "Wool Face", [...] "Triangle Face" [...] and [...] "Sun Face", which appeared on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Songs sheet music for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's songs.|$|R
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. <b>In</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt impeachment proceedings, and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
5|$|Clorinde {{had been}} almost {{undamaged}} in the battle and comfortably outran all British pursuit. Without a safe harbour in the entire Indian Ocean, Saint-Criq initially sailed for the Seychelles, hiding among the islands until 7 June. On 26 June, Clorinde landed at Diego Garcia and collected fresh water and coconuts before beginning the return journey to France <b>in</b> <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orders to continue on to Batavia issued before the convoy left Brest. On 1 August, Clorinde passed the Cape of Good Hope, Saint-Criq supplementing his provisions by raiding British and American merchant ships in the Atlantic. On 24 September, Clorinde encountered the British blockade squadron off Brest and was chased by the 80-gun ship of the line HMS Tonnant under Captain Sir John Gore. Although Tonnant came close enough to Clorinde to discharge her broadside at the frigate, Gore was unable to catch the elusive French ship and was eventually forced to retire to open waters after coming under fire from batteries at Pointe Trépassée. By 17:00, Clorinde was anchored in Brest harbour. Saint-Criq was heavily criticised for his failure to support Roquebert and for ignoring his orders to sail to Batavia if Mauritius had been captured. In March 1812, he was brought to a court martial to examine his behaviour and found to have been negligent in his duty, {{for which he was}} dismissed from the service, expelled from the legion of Honour and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Napoleon is reported to have suggested that Saint-Criq be shot for deserting his commanding officer.|$|E

The Emperor, her uncle Claudius, without {{securing}} any defence for his niece, had her executed 'by the sword' (Octavia 944-6: [...] "ferro... caesa est"). She may have anticipated execution by taking her own life. Her distant relative Pomponia Graecina remained in mourning for 40 years <b>in</b> open <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, yet was unpunished.

2500|$|<b>In</b> direct <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court, Gomarus then {{published}} the speech {{he had made}} before it, and Arminius followed suit by publishing his own speech. In response to the Court's opinion Gomarus declared that [...] "he would not dare die holding Arminius' opinion, nor to appear with it before God's judgement seat." [...] Arminius then asked to defend his positions in public or for a national or provincial synod to be called to examine the matter.

5|$|Since Alvarado's {{supporters}} {{had been}} confirmed in <b>the</b> town council <b>of</b> Gracias a Dios, and used obscure legalistic arguments to refuse Cáceres' authority, he withdrew {{to a nearby}} Indian village and plotted to overthrow the town council.

Cáceres launched a coup at dawn early in 1537, entered Gracias a Dios with twenty well-armed soldiers and imprisoned the town council, including Gonzalo de Alvarado. Cáceres declared Montejo as governor of Honduras-Higueras, and named himself as lieutenant governor and captain-general. He met little opposition from <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish citizens, and appointed a new town council.|$|R
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to the Big Bang, Lerner adopted Alfvén's model of plasma cosmology that relied on plasma physics to explain most, if not all, cosmological observations by appealing to electromagnetic forces. Adopting an eternal universe, Lerner's explanation of cosmological evolution relied on a model of thermodynamics based on <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nobel Chemistry prize winner Ilya Prigogine under which order emerges from chaos. This is <b>in</b> apparent <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second law <b>of</b> thermodynamics. As a way of partially acknowledging this, Lerner asserts that away from equilibrium order can spontaneously form by taking advantage of energy flows, as argued more recently by Eric Chaisson, an American astrophysicist.|$|R
