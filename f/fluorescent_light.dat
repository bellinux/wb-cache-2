5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> come in many form factors, {{including}} long, thin bulbs {{as well as}} smaller spiral shaped bulbs (compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights).</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> {{are available}} in color temperatures ranging from 2700 K to 10,000 K. The luminous efficacy ranges from 30 lm/W to 90 lm/W. The two main types of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> used for growing plants are the tube-style <b>lights</b> and compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lighting</b> {{comes in}} {{multiple}} form factors, including the T5, T8 and T12. The brightest version is the T5. The T8 and T12 are less powerful {{and are more}} suited to plants with lower <b>light</b> needs. High-output <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> produce twice as much <b>light</b> as standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights.</b> A high-output <b>fluorescent</b> fixture has a very thin profile, making it useful in vertically limited areas.|$|R
50|$|Compact <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> (CFLs) {{are smaller}} {{versions}} of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights</b> that were originally designed as pre-heat lamps, but {{are now available}} in rapid-start form. CFLs have largely replaced incandescent light bulbs in households because they last longer and are much more electrically efficient. In some cases, CFLs are also used as grow <b>lights.</b> Like standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lights,</b> they are useful for propagation and situations where relatively low light levels are needed.|$|R
5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light.</b> Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E

The wavelengths of light that the butterflies see the best correspond to the absorbance of the crystals in the butterfly's wings. This likely functions to enhance the capacity for signaling.|$|E

25|$|A compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL), also called compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light,</b> energy-saving light, and {{compact fluorescent}} tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs.

25|$|In general, emitted <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> has {{a longer}} {{wavelength}} and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, {{is due to}} energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed {{and when it is}} emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> {{fixtures}} {{cannot be}} connected to dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{require a}} ballast to {{stabilize}} the current through the lamp, and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge. This increases the cost of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>light</b> fixtures, though often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps. Electromagnetic ballasts with a minor fault can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise. Magnetic ballasts are usually filled with a tar-like potting compound to reduce emitted noise. Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast. Energy lost in magnetic ballasts was around 10% of lamp input power according to GE literature from 1978. Electronic ballasts reduce this loss.|$|E
