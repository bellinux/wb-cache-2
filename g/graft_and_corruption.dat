25|$|As President, Macapagal {{worked to}} {{suppress}} <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> and {{to stimulate the}} Philippine economy. He introduced the country's first land reform law, placed the peso on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival Nacionalista Party. He is also known for shifting the country's observance of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12, commemorating the day President Emilio Aguinaldo unilaterally declared {{the independence of the}} First Philippine Republic from the Spanish Empire in 1898. He stood for re-election in 1965, and was defeated by Ferdinand Marcos, who subsequently ruled for 21 years.|$|E
25|$|Marcos' {{second term}} for the {{presidency}} was marred by allegations by the opposition Liberal Party of widespread <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption.</b> According to leftists who rioted during the First Quarter Storm, the increasing disparity of wealth between the very wealthy and the very poor {{that made up the}} majority of the Philippines' population led to a rise in crime and civil unrest around the country. These factors, including the formation of the New People's Army and a bloody Muslim separatist movement in the southern island of Mindanao led by the Moro National Liberation Front backed by Malaysia and allegedly by Liberal Party senator Ninoy Aquino, contributed to the rapid rise of civil discontent and unrest in the country.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s and 1960s, {{the area}} went into decline, {{in line with}} a trend of general urban {{deterioration}} in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by city planner Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the superblock where they stand today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing {{much in the way}} of amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved.|$|E
5000|$|The stated {{vision for}} {{industrialization}} is: [...] "Research to Innovation, Innovation to Industry and Industry to prosperity." [...] The policy encompasses fourteen thrust areas {{with a plan}} to develop six industrial corridors and common infrastructure.

While large companies such as ITC, Tata Motors and Mahindra are planning to expand their business in the newly developed state(s), this policy has also gained significance in the investment community.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of Prohibition, the police force came under fire for {{widespread}} <b>corruption</b> <b>and</b> its ineffectiveness in the enforcement of the Volstead Act and the rising violence from the [...] "Bootleg Wars". In 1921, a grand jury and Legislative investigation committee looked into the department's activities regarding <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> police <b>corruption.</b> Partially {{as a result of their}} findings, Enright's resignation was demanded by the Citizens Union and several newspapers. The next year, Enright issued libel suits against an assemblyman and city magistrate based on correspondence charging police bootleg grafting. Though he lost in both cases, he did receive an apology from the two men.|$|R
50|$|The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today is a {{novel by}} Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner first {{published}} in 1873. It satirizes greed <b>and</b> political <b>corruption</b> in post-Civil War America in the era now {{referred to as the}} Gilded Age. Although not one of Twain's best-known works, it has appeared in more than one hundred editions since its original publication. Twain and Warner originally had planned to issue the novel with illustrations by Thomas Nast. The book is remarkable for two reasons--it is the only novel Twain wrote with a collaborator, and its title very quickly became synonymous with <b>graft,</b> materialism, <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> in public life.|$|R
500|$|The {{leadership}} of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, {{the very nature of}} construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: [...] the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.|$|E

2500|$|Recto was {{defeated}} in the election and never became president. Since his time, subsequent administrations practiced with fidelity and enthusiasm what he called [...] "subservience and colonial mentality," [...] most of them with greed and rapacious intents. To the judgment of Recto and many political gurus, colonial mentality towards America by the sycophant Philippine government, and its evil twin—servility to the almighty dollar, are among the major contributories to <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption,</b> which in turn have paralyzed the nation's economy.|$|E
5000|$|From 1900 to 1910, {{the town}} of Calolbon felt the strains of the transition. The people slowly {{adjusted}} the new era, hoped for the lesser cruelty and prayed for a total change. Religion at that times was their consolation, their weapon and solace toward off evils, their source of hope for {{a better place to}} live in only through the power of prayers that their wishes be granted. Religious as they were, the families did not miss a single day reciting the Angelus at six o’clock in the morning and in the evening. By nature, the natives were resilient, hardworking and God-fearing. Their means of living primarily came from farming, supplemented fishing. This was the picture of Calolbon and its people, where <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruptions</b> <b>and</b> various crimes were unheard of.It was harvest season (October to November); the people were busy harvesting the palay. One late morning, another happening was in the making. Pacio Socao, together with his companion, was herding carabaos in the Culapnit, a few kilometers away from the Poblacion.After placing their carabaos in a grassy plain, Pacio started to look for a place where he might rest, and he chose an [...] "Iba" [...] tree commonly called kamias. When he started to climb, he was attracted by a luminous object sparkling light under 10:00 o’clock in the morning sun. He picked the object and saw a picture of a face of an enchanting woman printed in a hard stone. He showed it to his companion and remarked that it might be an “aswang” or some evil spirit, so Pacio threw the stone and it landed near in carabao mud-hole (lab-ogan) surrounded by thick bushes and guava trees. For a moment, the incident was forgotten by two boys.|$|R
5000|$|Giles Mompesson (1583/1584 - 1663) was an English office {{holder and}} {{politician}} {{who sat in}} the House of Commons between 1614 and 1621 when he was sentenced for corruption. He was officially a [...] "notorious criminal" [...] whose career was one based on speculation <b>and</b> <b>graft.</b> His name came {{to be regarded as}} a synonym for <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> official <b>corruption</b> because he used nepotism to gain positions for licensing businesses by which he pocketed the fees. In the reaction against Charles I, Mompesson's name was invoked as a symbol of all that was wrong with aristocracy. Sir Giles Overreach, the anti-hero of Philip Massinger's 1625 play A New Way to Pay Old Debts, is based on Mompesson.|$|R
5000|$|This {{system of}} {{political}} control—known as [...] "bossism"—emerged {{particularly in the}} Gilded Age. A single powerful figure (the boss) {{was at the center}} and was bound together to a complex organization of lesser figures (the political machine) by reciprocity in promoting financial and social self-interest. One of the most infamous of these political machines was Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party machine that {{played a major role in}} controlling New York City and New York politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish [...] "boss". However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> political <b>corruption,</b> perhaps most notoriously under William M. [...] "Boss" [...] Tweed in the mid-19th century.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} election, he tangled {{with one of}} the best debaters of the {{opposing}} party, the Nationalista Party (NP), on the issue of proportional representation in various committees. He also composed a seminal article, published and editorialized in various papers, on the Philippines' territorial claim to North Borneo (Sabah). With the election of Cornelio Villareal (LP, Capiz) as Speaker of the House, Salonga was appointed to the chairmanship of the prestigious Committee on Good Government and led the committee in conducting inquires in aid of legislation relentlessly about the prevailing <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> in the government and recommended filing of charges against some government officials and employees. In June 1962, President Macapagal filed the Philippine petition against Malaysia's alleged illegal expropriation of North Borneo. Salonga was appointed to head the delegation in the January 1963 London negotiations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ombudsman}} {{is one of}} {{the several}} impeachable officials: the others being the president, vice president, justices of the Supreme Court {{and the members of the}} constitutional commissions (Audit, Civil Service and Elections).

Furthermore, only one [...] "impeachment proceeding" [...] is allowed to be held against an official in a year, although the definition of the term [...] "impeachment proceeding" [...] and [...] "year" [...] have been vague. The House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach, while the Senate has the sole power to try the impeached official. The House of Representatives needs one-third of its members to impeach an official, while the Senate needs to muster two-thirds of its members to convict.|$|E
2500|$|Jose Maria Sison is {{the central}} figure behind the CPP and its formation. According to Party documents, in the 1960s, a massive leftist unrest called First Quarter Storm {{occurred}} {{in the country to}} protest against the government policies, <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> and decline of the economy during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. The unrest was also inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War and other revolutionary struggles abroad against United States imperialist aggression. One of the leaders of this leftist movement was Jose Maria Sison, a founder of Kabataang Makabayan. He was soon recruited {{to be a member of}} Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP-1930). During that time the new PKP members, independently from the incumbent PKP members, were conducting clandestine theoretical and political education on Marxism–Leninism, with special attention dedicated to workers, peasants and youth. This would eventually lead to a significant split between the PKP members. The new members advocated to resume what they regarded as the unfinished armed revolution against foreign and feudal domination, referring to the legacy and de facto continuation of the Philippine–American War of 1899, combat subjectivism and opportunism in the history of the old merger party and fight modern revisionism then being promoted by the Soviet Union. This ideology was the basis for the split from the PKP-1930, the (re)creation of the CPP, and the subsequent [...] "Congress of Reestablishment." ...|$|E

[...] The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another.

The series is shot in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, with Lilywhite and Knutt often seen drinking at the Clovelly Bowling Club and numerous references to Maroubra. [...] Police misconduct had been a real-life problem in New South Wales and elsewhere in Australia.|$|R
2500|$|Tammany Hall {{took the}} new system in its stride, as it pushed a new city charter through the Tammany-controlled {{legislature}} in 1870. The new charter invested most of the city's power in the Board of Apportionment, consisting of the mayor, the comptroller, the commissioner of parks and the commissioner of public works, who were, of course, all Tammany men loyal to William M. [...] "Boss" [...] Tweed. These same men, with slight variations, were also the Board of Supervisors, the Board of Audit, and the Board of Street Openings, creating vast new opportunities for <b>graft</b> <b>and</b> <b>corruption.</b> Tweed himself {{was the head of}} the Department of Public Works, and controlled when and where the grid would be activated. The pace of the expansion of the grid picked up tremendously, but so did the money going into Tweed's pockets, as Tweed invested in land and then increased its value by opening streets in the areas he had invested in. [...] Tweed's investments were all over the city, but especially on the East Side. [...] Tweed was eventually tried and jailed, but in his wake he left a city whose development had pushed ahead of its previous sluggish pace, as well as a city raked with debt, since rather than raise taxes for the public works he ordered, the city borrowed money on a massive scale, doubling its debt load in just two years, from $36 million in January 1869 to $73 million.|$|E
