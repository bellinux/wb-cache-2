The structures of actual wood can be treated as micro cell structure and layer one. Several deformation characteristics were obtained in compression process. Characteristics of the deformation were investigated experimentally. The following results were obtained for the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> (1) The deformation modes of cell structures and the locations where deformation is generated were clarified. (2) The characteristics of the compression of layered structures were clarified.

30|$|As {{this short}} review clearly documented, the thermal {{expansion}} {{has been considered}} during the years as a minor problem compared to the hygroscopic <b>deformations</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> This is absolutely expected, as the two phenomena have different orders of magnitude: for example, the highest value reported in Table  1 (white pine measured by Hendershot αtrasv 72.7 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K- 1) indicates a thermal expansion of 0.07 % of the initial length for a 10  °C variation (from 20 to 30  °C), while a 10 % variation in relative humidity (with a tangential shrinkage coefficient of 12) {{would result in a}} <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> 1.2 % (17 times more).|$|R
30|$|To {{clarify the}} {{influence}} of drying and/or quenching histories on lateral tensile <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> we studied lateral tensile deformation properties of water-swollen wood with those histories. The results obtained are as follows. In the 45 ° angle sample with drying history, the failure strain was about 15  %. The value was about 3 – 4 times {{as compared to the}} results in the 0 ° and 90 ° angle samples. Further, except for the 90 ° angle sample with drying history, failure strain was increased about 20  % by giving drying and/or quenching histories. These results show that giving drying and/or quenching histories is the effective method for wood to increase the tensile deformation of the wood even in the water-swollen condition at 25  °C because of some unstable states caused by these histories. Therefore, largely unstable states given by various kinds of histories should make it possible to increase in the lateral tensile <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E

The results of their examination indicated that the failure strain of wood increased under the influence of its softening through moisture and heat effects. Then, it was thought that rheological properties were contributable to fracture.|$|E

[5] and Patera et al. [25]. Therefore, the transformation analysis includes both the affine and non-rigid components, as shown in Eq.  6. The global transformation Tglobal(x, y, z) is the affine transformation resulting from the affine registration model, as described in Derome et al. [5] and Patera et al. [25].|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, it was {{reported}} that physical properties <b>of</b> water-swollen <b>wood</b> are affected by drying and/or quenching histories [3, 4]. In these reports, elastic modulus and strength were reduced, and fluidity was increased in comparison to annealed sample <b>of</b> water-swollen <b>wood.</b> And these physical properties depended on the soaking time in water after drying and/or quenching. Thus, many physical properties <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> are affected by change of environment such as moisture and temperature.

30|$|Chemical {{treatment}} of wood {{is one of}} the major methods to change its properties such as biodegradability, combustibility, and dimensional instability [1]. In the treatments, the chemical substance has been developed and introduced into wood to control these properties that can lead to some troubles during usage of wood [2], for example, the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> under changing climate is decreased by the bulking effect of the introduced substance such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or phenol–formaldehyde resin. For the effective improvement especially of the dimensional stability, the chemical substance is required to exist in wood cell walls rather than in cell cavities [3].|$|E
30|$|Digital image {{correlation}} (DIC) method, {{which is also}} known as digital speckle photography (DSP) method, is a non-contact method that measures strain on the surface of a material which undergoes deformation by comparing the local grayscale pattern of the digital images captured before and after the deformation. DIC method was developed by Peters et al. [13] and Sutton et al. [14] in the 1980 s, and it has been widely used to calculate strain in various materials [15]. DIC method is useful in a case, where specimen is so small that strain gauge cannot be attached [16]. Moreover, preparation {{on the surface of the}} material is not always necessary as long as the specimen has a random speckle pattern on its surface, which is essential for applying DIC method [17]. One of the earliest applications of DIC method to the measurement of strain in a wood specimen was conducted by Choi et al. [18]. Since then, the DIC method has been widely applied for analyzing the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and wood-based materials in compression tests [19 – 25], in tensile tests [16, 26 – 35], in drying or swelling tests [36 – 38], and so on. Hellström et al. applied DSP method to determine the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> in a chipping process [39]. However, the relation between the machining defects and the strain distribution has not been discussed, since the main concern of the chipping process is the quality of the chip, not the quality of the surface.|$|E

30|$|The {{value of}} μ on WS wood {{was more than}} 0.1, which {{suggests}} that boundary lubrication occurs on WS wood surfaces. The value of μ tended to be higher with WS wood than with OD wood. The {{results suggest that the}} contact characteristics between these two types <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> are significantly different. The water content in wood affects both the contact characteristics at the interface and the <b>deformation</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>wood,</b> so that precise identification of the contributions from the factors involved is not simple.|$|R
30|$|When {{the results}} for OD wood are {{compared}} with those for WS wood at the same friction surface and load level, μ was equal or higher for the WS wood compared to OD wood. A previous study [7] in a low pressure range revealed lower μ with WS wood than with OD wood, while another study demonstrated higher μ with WS wood [13]. Guan et al. [13] suggested that the cause for such discrepancy was {{the influence of the}} water supply conditions during measurement. When exposed to high levels of pressure that can cause marked <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> water supply to the interface is difficult because the water retained in the lumen is drained out by pre-sliding compression. Therefore, it seems difficult to reduce the value of μ when a state of hydrodynamic lubrication exists under high pressure.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of THM processing with excessive compression on the <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> cell structure, as well as the physical and mechanical properties of treated poplar wood with the CR above 50 %. Due to alteration of the cell wall of wood during the THM processing, the porosity or cell wall density alters and the pore size distribution changes. Based on the fact, the cell morphology and porosity of THM wood in relation to the CR were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The narrowed cell cavity and changed cell wall generated by THM processing can also lead to mechanical strength, liquid permeability, and dimensional stability. The mechanical properties, set recovery (SR) as well as water absorption (WA) of THM wood were also examined.|$|E
30|$|The MOE and MOR of curved samples under tension loading are {{estimated}} to be three and two times larger than the control samples and also MOE and MOR of curved samples under compression loading are six and four times larger than the control samples, respectively. But bending strength of curved wood is decreased due to cell wall fracture and <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> cells by the applied compression stress through the combined effect of pressure and high temperature. The failure modes of thermal treatment sample are brittle, and the failure modes of curved wood show the mobility and flexibility, when compared to control samples (Fig.  11). The formatting operation can be adjusted according to the failure modes. Finally, the usage type of curved wood has a great role for an excellent performance of chair structures. In addition, modified wood has more advantages such as dimensional stability when compared to solid wood.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} load rate on the {{load-carrying}} capabilities <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> cribs is investigated in this Bureau of Mines study. The modulus <b>of</b> <b>deformation</b> (stiffness) <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> crib blocks {{has been shown}} to increase with increases in rates of load application, causing larger load reactions for increases in convergence rates. Since wood cribs are tested in the laboratory at convergence rates that are orders of magnitude faster than typically would occur underground, wood cribs tested in the laboratory will react larger loads than the same cribs would react underground for the same displacement. Tests conducted in the Bureau's mine roof simulator on green wood crib blocks indicate that the increase in stiffness for increasing load rates diminishes at displacement rates beyond 0. 1 in/min, making crib load nearly independent of load rate for rates faster than 0. 1 in/min. Seasoned wood specimens were not as con-sistent in load-rate dependency. Some possible explanations of observed load-rate behavior on wood crib specimens are also postulated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the course}} of our studies, we have learned that solid wood has {{significant}} deformability characteristics under specific conditions, resulting from slippage occurring among wood cells when wood treated with small-molecular resins is compressed under heat. Furthermore, the deformed shapes obtained are maintained when the resin introduced into the wood cells is cured. In this study, the lateral extrusion of thin discs <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> treated with thermosetting phenol resin is performed to apply this flowlike <b>deformation</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> to wood-forming techniques. Resin-treated thin discs <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> placed in a heating container were compressed by a punch, and under constant pressure the wood flowed into the cavity of a mold. Successful molding conditions were achieved by varying the pressure, temperature and wood fiber direction for the extrusion ratio of 42.

30|$|Techniques for {{deforming}} wood {{into various}} shapes {{are required to}} improve the processability of wood products. However, wood has a low ductility. When veneers are press molded into a tray or pasted on the curved surface, cracks often occur in {{large parts of the}} curvature. It is considered that the reasons for these problems are due to small lateral tensile deformation and strength. Therefore, to improve the processability of wood, first of all, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the lateral tensile <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> And then, these studies should be applied to the various deformation processes technology of wood. However, physical properties of lateral tensile deformation have not been made sufficiently clear in previous studies.

30|$|Lateral tensile {{deformation}} properties of wood were studied {{to clarify the}} {{tensile deformation}} properties of wood with drying and/or quenching histories, and it was discussed whether giving these histories was effective to increase the lateral tensile <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> The results obtained are as follows. In all of the samples with drying and/or quenching histories, failure strain was increased and elastic modulus was decreased. In all of the measurement conditions, the failure strain of 45 ° angle sample with history was the largest. This result {{was caused by the}} shearing deformation of cells which showed diamond-shaped deformation during increasing tensile stress. This shearing deformation of the cell shape was promoted by increase of fluidity and decrease of elastic modulus which were caused by treatment of drying and/or quenching. These results suggest that giving drying and/or quenching histories is effective for wood to increase the tensile deformation even in water saturated condition at 25  °C.|$|E

Strain distribution on the cross-sectional surface of the wood during drying was successfully visualized, and the position and timing of the stress reversals were detected. From the comparison of the strain distributions between mild and severe drying conditions, it was determined that the rheological <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> under mild drying conditions is much more severe than under severe drying condition as the mild case required more time to dry.

The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain was decreased by cross laminating. The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain <b>of</b> parallel-laminated <b>woods</b> (P⊥ type), that perpendicular to the grain of face laminae <b>of</b> cross-laminated <b>woods</b> (C⊥ type), and also that parallel to the grain of face laminae <b>of</b> cross-laminated <b>woods</b> (C║ type) tended to decrease with increasing density of species used for perpendicular-direction lamina. It was found that the extent of the decrease was greater in creep deformation than in initial <b>deformation.</b> The degrees <b>of</b> anisotropy for both <b>deformations</b> <b>of</b> laminated <b>wood</b> were markedly decreased by cross laminating. The extent of the decrease was much greater in creep deformation than in initial deformation and considerably smaller in buna with higher density than in sugi with lower density. The measured values <b>of</b> initial <b>deformation</b> and creep <b>deformation</b> <b>of</b> C⊥ type were almost equal to the calculated values obtained from the measured values <b>of</b> parallel-laminated <b>woods,</b> whereas the measured values <b>of</b> both <b>deformations</b> <b>of</b> C║ type were much greater than their calculated values and increased markedly with increasing shear compliance in cross section of perpendicular-direction lamina used for core.

This result can be explained as the effect of deflection caused by shear force.|$|R
