25|$|As {{a visible}} {{change in the}} beach {{immediately}} after the tsunami, the <b>intertidal</b> <b>area</b> was much flatter on 27 December 2004, which usually featured a gentle slope. However, the usual slope started to appear 4 days after the tsunami and normal profile was restored in about 15 days. The receding wave after the tsunami lasted for more than 24h. Post tsunami, there was a distinct variation {{in the distribution of}} sand grains in the beach until the 4th day. However, from the 5th day after the tsunami, normal composition of sand grains appeared to have been restored at different depths. The tsunami also resulted in various geomorphological changes in the region such as those in the contour of the 2,000km-long Burma Plate, which sits atop the India plate, resulting in a rise in the land level of Chennai, ranging between 0.5cm and 3cm.|$|E
500|$|The {{course of}} the river below Bridgwater is now {{somewhat}} straighter than in former times. The village of Combwich lies adjacent to a channel in the river known as [...] "Combwich Reach"; from here the Parrett flows to the Bristol Channel past the Steart Peninsula. Cartographic evidence indicates {{that in the early}} 18th century the peninsula was longer than at present. A [...] "neck" [...] started to form in the peninsula, and by 1802 the tip had broken off to form Stert Island. Fenning Island also broke away but has rejoined the peninsula. Much of the peninsula's northern end eroded away or now exists as [...] "islands" [...] visible at low tide within an <b>intertidal</b> <b>area</b> of mud known as the Stert Flats.|$|E
40|$|Intertidal Deposits: River Mouths, Tidal Flats, and Coastal Lagoons {{combines}} the authors {{personal and professional}} experience with the mass of available literature to present a cohesive overview of intertidal deposits and the widely diverse conditions of their formation worldwide. This includes the strong influence of water movements, climate, sediment particle characteristics, vegetation, fauna, and man. <b>Intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> are important for many reasons both scientifically and economically and recently, {{a growing concern for}} conservation of these fragile regions strives to preserve and protect their natural balance. This book, written by an international expert in the field, concentrates on the more important <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> distinguished by size and morphology, tidal range, the degree and type of vegetational cover, the amount and type of benthic fauna, the extent of human exploitation, and the degree of previous study. Discusses the more important <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas,</b> subdivided by tidal range. Includes a series of chapters on the morphology of <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> (including channels and creeks), the composition and structures of intertidal sediments, the processes of sediment transport, deposition and erosion, and the influence of intertidal flora and fauna. Presents separate sections on benthic fauna and microflora, saltmarshes, mangroves, and algal mats and seagrasses. Addresses the influence of man on existing <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas.</b> Provides a short chapter on the Holocene history of <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the biophysical factors controlling invertebrate communities on rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> in Batemans Marine Park, NSW. The biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure, rock type and sub habitat diversity, and Marine Park zoning, affect invertebrate species richness, abundance and diversity in a hierarchical manner. The biophysical factors influence biological processes such as recruitment and settlement, and physical stressors such as thermal stress and sun exposure, which affect invertebrate species richness, abundance and diversity on rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas.</b> Rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> are exposed {{to a range of}} anthropogenic pressures, such as urban development and recreational and commercial activities. As these anthropogenic pressures increase, the need to protect and conserve species richness, abundance and diversity on rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> increases. Understanding the drivers of species richness, abundance and diversity on rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> provides a scientific basis for the conservation and management of rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas.</b> This study characterised the biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure, rock type and sub habitat diversity on rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> across Batemans Marine Park. Invertebrate species richness, abundance, and diversity were analysed in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. Non-liner mixed effects modelling was used to investigate species richness, species diversity and the abundance of Austrolittorina unifasciata, Nerita atramentosa, Tesseropora rosea, Morula marginalba and Bembicium nanum in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to investigate species abundance in relation to wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity. The key findings of the analyses of species richness, abundance and diversity in relation to the biophysical factors of wave aspect, wave exposure and sub habitat diversity showed the hierarchical link between invertebrate communities and biophysical factors. Wave aspect influenced species richness, diversity, abundance, and the abundance of A. unifasciata, N. atramentosa, T. rosea, M. marginalba and B. nanum directly; and indirectly through the interaction between wave aspect and wave exposure, and wave aspect and sub habitat diversity. Sub habitat diversity was significantly related to species richness, diversity and abundance of A. unifasciata, N. atramentosa, T. rosea, M. marginalba and B. nanum independently of wave aspect and wave exposure. The relationship between invertebrate communities and sub habitat diversity demonstrates that a diverse range of sub habitats enables a wide range of invertebrates to inhabit rocky <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas.</b> The conservation implications of these findings were explored...|$|R

40|$|Trabajo presentado en el III Simposio Internacional en Ciencias del Mar (ISMS 12), celebrado en Cádiz del 24 al 26 {{de enero}} de 2012. Digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) of <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> {{are important in}} a number of applications (ecological modelling, geomorphodynamics, sea-level change). However, field measurements of height profiles can be difficult to collect (either on foot or using a boat) and advanced airborne methods (such as LIDAR) can be rather expensive. We evaluate the use of freely available remote sensing (RS) images (LANDSAT 5 TM) to derive a DEM for <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas</b> within Cádiz Bay. Waterlines were extracted from 12 images over a period of 18 months (2009 to 2011), representing different stages of the tide (measured in Cádiz Port). These contour lines were used to construct a DEM via kriging. RS-derived topography was compared to transects of shore height measured using a dGPS. The waterline method applied to LANDSAT 5 TM images offers a cheap and quick way to derive a reasonably accurate DEM within <b>intertidal</b> <b>areas.</b> The method can be semi-automated and is generally suitable for low-energy zones, where large waves are infrequent, the topography is relatively stable and not very abrupt.
