30|$|In {{general the}} design of such {{structural}} elements requires the calculation of stresses, strains and displacements for the design loads. Strains and stresses are related by the so-called constitutive law. The simplest one consists of the linear elasticity. Despite its simplicity many structures are designed for working precisely within the elastic domain. Other designs require considering more complex behaviors (e.g. non-linear elasticity due to material or geometrical non linearities, elastoplastic behaviors usually encountered in material forming – <b>forging,</b> <b>bending,...</b> –, or complex multiphysics behaviors as the ones encountered in composites manufacturing processes implying change of phases, crystallization, polymerization,... coupled with rich thermomechanical mechanisms).|$|R
25|$|Shoes {{are then}} {{measured}} {{to the foot}} and bent to the correct shape using a hammer and anvil, and other modifications, such as taps for shoe studs, are added. Farriers may either cold shoe, in which he bends the metal shoe without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a <b>forge</b> before <b>bending</b> it. Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|R

Thus, {{the role of}} micro manufacturing {{in all aspects of}} modern industry is taken for granted. Then, typical processes in micro manufacturing are discussed. Furthermore, one of the most widespread micro-manufacturing processes in deforming processes is micro forming that is presented in this paper. Finally, besides continuing effort in developing micro forming, this paper strives to analyze systematically the key methods of stamping, <b>bending,</b> <b>forging</b> and deep drawing processes and their prominent issues...|$|R

40|$|Viable {{processes}} {{were developed}} for secondary working of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys to near-net shapes (NNS) for aircraft turbine vanes. These processes were shown {{capable of producing}} required microstructure and properties for vane applications. Material cost savings of 40 to 50 % are projected for the NNS process over the current procedures which involve machining from rectangular bar. Additional machining cost savings are projected. Of three secondary working processes evaluated, directional <b>forging</b> and plate <b>bending</b> were determined to be viable NNS processes for ODS vanes. Directional forging was deemed most applicable to high pressure turbine (HPT) vanes with their large thickness variations while plate bending {{was determined to be}} most cost effective for low pressure turbine (LPT) vanes because of their limited thickness variations. Since the F 101 LPT vane was selected for study in this program, development of plate bending was carried through to establishment of a preliminary process. Preparation of ODS alloy plate for bending was found to be a straight forward process using currently available bar stock, providing that the capability for reheating between roll passes is available. Advanced ODS-NiCrAl and ODS-FeCrAl alloys were utilized on this program. Workability of all alloys was adequate for directional <b>forging</b> and plate <b>bending,</b> but only the ODS-FeCrAl had adequate workability for shaped preform extrustion...|$|R

40|$|Forming of {{high-strength}} steels {{leads to}} high loads within the production process. In multistage metal forming, the loads in different process stages are {{transferred to the}} other stages through elastic deformation of the stamping press. This leads to interactions between process steps, affecting the process forces in each stage and the final geometry of the product. When force measurements are used {{for control of the}} metal forming process, {{it is important to understand}} these interactions. In his work, interactions within an industrial multistage forming process are investigated. Cutting, deepdrawing, <b>forging</b> and <b>bending</b> steps are performed in the production process. Several test runs of a few thousand products each were performed to gather information about the process. Statistical methods are used to analyze the measurements. Based on the cross-correlation between the force measurements of different stages, it can be shown that the interactions between the process steps are caused by elastic deformation of the tooling and the stamping press...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} base {{traditionally}} {{was a hard}} wood log or large timber buried several feet into {{the floor of the}} forge shop floor. This was done to make the anvil immobile when heavy <b>forging</b> and <b>bending</b> were done upon the anvil. In the industrial era cast iron bases became available. They had the advantage of adding additional weight to the anvil, making it more stable while making the anvil movable. These bases are highly sought after by collectors today. When concrete became widely available, there was a trend to make steel reinforced anvil bases by some smiths, though this practice has largely been abandoned. In more modern times many anvils have been placed upon bases fabricated from steel, often a short thick section of a large I-Beam. In addition, bases have been made from dimensional lumber bolted together to form a large block or steel drums full of oil-saturated sand to provide a damping effect. In recent times tripod bases of fabricated steel have become popular with some smiths.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} process of large crankshafts {{is affected by}} undesirable bending of the shaft blank at the heating and heat treatment stages, {{as well as at}} the forging step. In line elimination of the shaft blank bending is a time consuming and expensive operation. Identification of reasons of the shaft bending and identification of possibilities of avoiding this bending is an important theoretical and practical problem. In previous works, the Authors developed the finite element model and applied this model to optimization of the forging process and to predict microstructure evolution. The model was extended to predict bending of shaft and applied in the present work to simulate the influence of various parameters of <b>forging</b> on shaft <b>bending.</b> The work is devoted to further extension of the model by including deformation of the crankshaft during heat treatment after forging. The model estimates the contribution of the elastic-plastic deformation, including thermal expansion and dilatometric effect due to transformations, on the deformation and bending of the shaft. This process generates also residual stresses. The aim of the paper was to simulate phenomena occurring during heat treatment. A program based on the finite element method was developed to solve the three-dimensional thermal and mechanical problems. Shaft material model was developed and the elastic-plastic characteristics were implemented in the FE code. Heat exchange with the cooling medium and the dependence of thermal properties on temperature and heat of phase transformations were accounted for in a solution of the thermal problem. Dilatometric tests were performed to supply data for identification of the phase transformation model during cooling. The results of calculations of bending of shaft during the process of heat treatment, as well as the distribution of residual stresses and strains are presented in the paper. The calculations were performed for several modes of the heat treatment. Parameters affecting bending of the shaft were identified...|$|R
