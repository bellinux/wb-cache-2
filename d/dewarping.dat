40|$|Continuing {{experiments}} in restoring images obtained by telescope looking in a near horizontal direction {{close to the}} ground are discussed. The input data are from a time-sequence of short exposure image frames of a scene that are registered to a prototype to determine the warping {{as a function of the}} image coordinates. The prototype is initially an average of the whole sequence, being a motion-blurred but geometrically correct result. Each frame is then <b>dewarped</b> according to its derived warping function to remove apparent internal motion, and the new sequence is averaged to produce a new prototype having reduced motion blur. Registration is carried out by cross correlation within a hierarchy of reducing windows or apertures in the prototype and the image frame to be registered. The effect is to "zoom in " on the relative motion at every pixel position within the image, obtaining x-shift and y-shift maps. The shift maps are used to <b>dewarp</b> the corresponding image frame. The resulting time-sequence of x-shift and y-shift maps also provides useful visualisations of the local directional tip and tilt behavior of the causal turbulence. This paper discusses development of the algorithms in MATLAB, and commissioning of new telescopes and imaging equipment. 1...|$|R

50|$|The key concept {{inside the}} perceptual model is Idealisation. The idea behind this is, that POLQA is {{supposed}} to simulate Absolute Category Rating (ACR) tests. In an ACR test however, subjects have no comparison to the actual reference signal when they score a speech signal. Instead, {{it is assumed that}} subjects have an understanding of what an ideal signal sounds like and they use this as their own reference. Consequently, if they are asked to score a reference signal which is not absolutely perfect (e.g. it has the wrong volume or contains too much timbre, noise or reverberation), it will be scored worse than perfect. In its idealization step POLQA therefore corrects small imperfections of the reference signals in order to derive the same ideal reference for the comparison to the degraded signal as human subjects would use in their minds. Similar to the idealization of the reference signal, some distortions present in the degraded signal which are hardly perceptible in an ACR test will be partially compensated (e.g. small pitch shifts, linear frequency distortions). The perceptual model starts with scaling the reference signal to an ideal average active speech level of approximately -26dBov. No such scaling is performed on the degraded signal. It is assumed that any deviation of the level of the degraded signal from the ideal -26dBov is to be scored as a degradation of the signal. Next, the spectra of both signals are computed using an FFT with 50% overlapping frames with a duration of between 32ms and 43ms duration (depending on the sample rate). Subsequently small pitch shifts of the degraded signal will be eliminated (Frequency <b>Dewarping).</b> Now, the spectra will be transformed to a psychoacoustically motivated pitch scale, by combining individual spectral lines (FFT bins) to so-called critical bands. The pitch scale used is similar to the Bark scale with an average resolution of 0.3 Bark per band. The result is the Pitch Power Density. At this stage the first three distortion indicators for frequency response distortions, additive noise and room reverberations are calculated.After this, the excitation of each band is derived. This includes the modeling of masking effects in the frequency {{as well as in the}} temporal domain. The result is for each frame of each signal a head-internal representation which indicates roughly how loud each frequency component would be perceived.Now, a further idealization step of the reference signal takes place by filtering out excessive timbre and low level stationary noise. At the same time, linear frequency distortions and stationary noise are partially removed from the degraded signal.A subtraction of the idealized excitations finally leads to the Distortion Density, which is measure for the audibility of distortions.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel video mosaicing method which {{is capable of}} generating a geometric distortion-free mosaic image. Video mosaicing, which stitches partial images of a target into a larger image called a mosaic image, {{has been used to}} obtain high resolution images of documents. Generally, mosaic images are prone to two types of geometric distortions: perspective distortion which appears when the target document is not fronto-parallel to the camera’s image plane, and curvature distortion which is caused by projecting curved surface of the target document to the image plane of the camera. This thesis first focuses on a flat document, and proposes a perspective distortion-free video mosaicing method for flat documents. In the proposed method, extrinsic camera parameters are estimated for each frame by applying structure from motion technique to the captured video. Using estimated extrinsic camera parameters, the method <b>dewarps</b> all the frame images and synthesizes them on a virtual fronto-parallel plane to generate a super-resolved mosaic image without perspective distortion. Then, this method for flat documents is extended to deal with curved documents. This extended method generates a virtually flattened mosaic image of a curved surface.

40|$|Abstract. As {{compared}} to scanners, cameras offer fast, flexible and non-contact document imaging, but with distortions like uneven shading and warped shape. Therefore, camera-captured document images need preprocessing steps like binarization and textline detection for <b>dewarping</b> so that traditional document image processing steps {{can be applied}} on them. Previous approaches of binarization and curled textline detection are sensitive to distortions and loose some crucial image information during each step, which badly affects <b>dewarping</b> and further processing. Here we introduce a novel algorithm for curled textline region detection directly from a grayscale camera-captured document image, in which matched filter bank approach is used for enhancing textline structure and then ridges detection is applied for finding central line of curled textlines. The resulting ridges can be potentially used for binarization, <b>dewarping</b> or designing new techniques for camera-captured document image processing.
