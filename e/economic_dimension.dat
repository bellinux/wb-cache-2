50|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{state-building}} has developed into becoming an integral part and even a specific approach to peacebuilding by the international community.

According to the political scientist Anders Persson, internationally led state-building is based on three dimensions: a security dimension, a political dimension and an <b>economic</b> <b>dimension.</b> Of these three, security is almost always considered the first priority.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is useful}} to {{consider}} that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment refers to the physical ecosystems, but can also {{take into consideration the}} social dimension (quality of life, health) and an <b>economic</b> <b>dimension</b> (resource management, biodiversity). Policy can be defined as a [...] "course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business or individual". Thus, environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment, which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the 'clean and green' environment.|$|E

Sihanouk insisted that the <b>economic</b> <b>dimension</b> of neutrality meant either total rejection of international aid (as practiced by Burma under Ne Win) or acceptance of foreign economic assistance from all countries without strings attached. Indeed, during the first decade that he was in power in newly independent Cambodia (1953-63), the prince carefully practiced his [...] "purer form of neutrality between East and West" [...] in seeking foreign economic assistance for development (see Cambodia under Sihanouk, 1954-70, ch. 1).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>dimension</b> is {{the most}} basic and least contested theme of the {{underclass}} - the underclass is overwhelmingly poor. The underclass experiences high levels of joblessness, and what little employment its members hold in the formal economy is best described as precarious labor. However, {{it is important to}} note that simply being poor is not synonymous with being part of the underclass. The underclass is persistently poor and, for most definitions, the underclass live in areas of concentrated poverty. Some scholars, such as Ricketts and Sawhill, argue that being poor is not a requirement for underclass membership, and thus there are individuals who are non-poor members of the underclass because they live in [...] "underclass areas" [...] and embody other characteristics of the underclass, such as being violent, criminal, and anti-social (e.g., gang leaders).|$|E
