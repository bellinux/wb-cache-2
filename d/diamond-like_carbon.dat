5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbon</b> (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{contribution}} reports Raman spectroscopic {{studies on}} nanometer-sized diamonds of different sizes. Surface structural {{analysis on the}} nanodiamonds were conducted by thermal annealing and atomic hydrogen etching in UHV environment, the carbon structural changes are analysed and compared for 100 nm and 5 nm sizes diamonds and pulsed laser deposited <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons.</b> Nano-meter sized diamond has become a new engineering material in many fields [1]. Recently, DNA-modified nanocrystalline diamond thin film has the potential use as stable biologically active substrates or a solid support for biological molecules such as DNA or proteins [2, 3]. In the interstellar space, nanodiamonds are, to date, the most abundant presolar grains, {{both in terms of}} mass and number, which have been extracted from primitive meteorites [4]. For the analysis of the surface structural information, Raman and IR spectroscopy have been useful tools. There have been many studies on the Raman spectra of diamonds and nano-meter diamonds, while the typical D-and G-band (~ 1350 cm- 1 and 1580 cm- 1) are clearly assigned, the assignments on the 1150 cm- 1 Raman peak have been undetermined. The most wildly accepted assignment for the 1150 cm- 1 peak are the nanocrystalline diamond [5] and the sp 2 phase of trans-polyethylene [6]. Here we report the study on the Raman features for different nano-meter sized diamonds and compared to the pulsed laser deposited <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons</b> under thermal annealing and atomic hydrogen etching.

25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbon</b> to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} {{manufacturers}} have sought ways of distinguishing their product by supposedly [...] "improving" [...] cubic zirconia. Coating finished CZs {{in a film}} of <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbon</b> (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using chemical vapor deposition. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess fire of CZ, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, {{because of the high}} percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in Raman spectra.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction of plastics is usually measured against polished steel. PTFE's {{coefficient of}} friction is 0.05 to 0.10, which is the third-lowest of any known solid material (BAM being the first, with a {{coefficient of friction}} of 0.02; <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbon</b> being second-lowest at 0.05). PTFE's resistance to van der Waals forces means {{that it is the}} only known surface to which a gecko cannot stick. [...] In fact, PTFE can be used to prevent insects climbing up surfaces painted with the material. PTFE is so slippery that insects cannot get a grip and tend to fall off. For example, PTFE is used to prevent ants climbing out of formicaria.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous <b>carbon,</b> <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons,</b> and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} the {{photoconductivity}} of hydrogenated tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C:H) with nitrogen incorporation were studied. Low level nitrogen incorporation improves the photoconductivity, by shifting the Fermi level upwards in the band gap. Films with a photosensitivity of about 200 at room temperature under white light illumination of 35 mW/cm 2 were obtained; thus is the highest value so far reported for <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons.</b> At high temperatures, photoconductivity is controlled by nonradiative recombination through gap states, whereas at low temperatures it occurs by energy-loss hopping in the band tails. Nitrogen addition does not create extra charge defect recombination centers. Low temperature photoconductivity allows the direct determination of the localization radius of the band tail states. This radius varies from 2 – 3 Å in ta-C:H to 9 Å in ta-C. This illustrates how hydrogen can increase state localization and the photoluminescence efficiency in amorphous carbons...|$|R
40|$|Various PVD (physical vapor deposition) hard {{coatings}} including nitrides and metal-doped <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons</b> (Me-DLC) were applied in plastic injection and die-casting molds to improve wear resistance and reduce sticking. In this study, nitrides hcp-AlN (hexagonal close-packed AlN), Cr 2 N, (CrAl) 2 N) and Me-DLC (Si-DLC and Cr-DLC) coatings were prepared using a closed field unbalanced magnetron reactive sputtering system. The coatings were annealed in air for 2 h at various temperatures, {{after which the}} anti-sticking properties were assessed using water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The as-deposited hcp-AlN, Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings exhibit hydrophobic behavior and exhibit respective WCAs of 119 °, 106 ° and 101 °. The as-deposited Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings exhibit hydrophilic behavior and exhibit respective WCAs of 74 ° and 88 °. The annealed Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings exhibit hydrophobic behavior with higher WCAs, while the annealed hcp-AlN, Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings are hydrophilic. The increased WCA of the annealed Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings is related to their crystal structure and increased roughness. The decreased WCA of the annealed hcp-AlN, Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings is related to their crystal structures and has little correlation with roughness...|$|R

30|$|Carbon {{nanosheet}} {{films were}} deposited on Al substrates by using plasma assisted {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PACVD) technique.

In Raman spectrum of carbon film, {{there was a strong}} and broadened peak at about 1, 580 cm− 1, indicating a <b>carbon</b> <b>diamond-like</b> film. Atomic force microscope image showed that the <b>carbon</b> <b>diamond-like</b> film had a grain size less than 100 nm, and its surface roughness Ra was 17.95 nm in an area of 5 × 5 μm 2. The CNSPs were irregular sheets with curly edges and a length of several micrometers to several hundreds of micrometers. The BET surface area of CNSPs was 6.66 m 2 /g with no micro-pore present, which was confirmed by N 2 adsorption-desorption characterization. In the adsorption testing, when the relative pressure p/p 0 was higher than 0.3, the adsorption behavior did not follow the Langmuir equation. The addition of CNSPs to carbon black (catalyst support) could improve hydrodesulfurization performance of carbon supported Ni-W catalysts for diesel oil.|$|R

40|$|In this program, we {{developed}} new theoretical and experimental insights into understanding {{the relationships among}} fundamental universality and scaling phenomena, the solid-state physical and mechanical properties of materials, and the volume plasmon energy as measured by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). Particular achievements in these areas are summarized as follows: (i) Using a previously proposed physical model based on the universal binding-energy relation (UBER), we established close phenomenological connections regarding {{the influence of the}} valence electrons in materials on the longitudinal plasma oscillations (plasmons) and various solid-state properties such as the optical constants (including absorption and dispersion), elastic constants, cohesive energy, etc. (ii) We found that carbon materials, e. g., diamond, graphite, <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons,</b> hydrogenated and amorphous carbon films, exhibit strong correlations in density vs. Ep (or maximum of the volume plasmon peak) and density vs. hardness, both from available experimental data and ab initio DFT calculations. This allowed us to derive a three-dimensional relationship between hardness and the plasmon energy, {{that can be used to}} determine experimentally both hardness and density of carbon materials based on measurements of the plasmon peak position. (iii) As major experimental accomplishments, we demonstrated the possibility of in-situ monitoring of changes in the physical properties of materials with conditions, e. g., temperature, and we also applied a new plasmon ratio-imaging technique to map multiple physical properties of materials, such as the elastic moduli, cohesive energy and bonding electron density, with a sub-nanometer lateral resolution. This presents new capability for understanding material behavior. (iv) Lastly, we demonstrated a new physical phenomenon - electron-beam trapping, or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂelectron tweezersÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ - of a solid metal nanoparticle inside a liquid metal. This phenomenon is analogous to that of optical trapping of solid microparticles in solution known as "optical tweezers", which is currently being used to manipulate molecules and inorganic materials in a variety of nanotechnology applications...|$|R
40|$|Graphene is a {{two-dimensional}} honey-comb lattice of carbon atoms with very unusual electron energy dispersion. Since its recent micromechanical isolation and measurements, graphene attracted tremendous {{attention of the}} physics and engineering communities. In addition to the wealth of two-dimensional electron gas physics revealed by graphene, {{it is a very}} promising material for the electronic and sensor applications. Graphene manifests extremely high charge carrier mobility at room temperature, which is far beyond the values achievable in the materials currently used in transistor designs. For this reason, graphene is considered for applications in the integrated circuits beyond the conventional silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor electronic technology. Some of the major problems associated with graphene research and applications are the difficulties of graphene identification, e. g. distinguishing it from other carbon materials, and verification of the number of graphene atomic layers. In this dissertation research we expand the use of the micro-Raman spectroscopy as the nanometrology tool for graphene material characterization. Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique, which is widely used to characterize structural and electronic properties of carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes, diamond, graphite and <b>diamond-like</b> <b>carbons.</b> Graphene's Raman spectrum has clear signatures, which allow one to identify it and determine the number of atomic layers with high accuracy. The main results of this dissertation are (i) measurement of the temperature coefficients of the G and 2 D peaks in Raman spectrum of graphene; (ii) the study of the effects of different substrates on Raman signatures of graphene; and (iii) the first investigation of the ultraviolet Raman spectrum of graphene. The obtained results are important for graphene identification and device applications since electric bias and gate voltages in graphene transistors result in the device self-heating while device fabrication often requires the use of various substrates with properties {{different from those of the}} standard silicon. In addition, graphene-device characterization is conducted at different temperatures. The measurements of temperature coefficients of graphene Raman peaks was also instrumental in the study of heat conduction in graphene and shed light on its anharmonic properties...|$|R

This paper describes a fabrication method of three-dimensional (3 D) graphene conformally coated on nanoporous insulating substrate with uniform nanopore size. 3 D graphene films were formed by controlled graphitization of <b>diamond-like</b> amorphous <b>carbon</b> precursor films, deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD). Plasma-assisted graphitization was found to produce better quality graphene than a simple thermal graphitization process. The resulting 3 D graphene/amorphous carbon/alumina structure has a very high surface area, good electrical conductivity and exhibits excellent chemically stability, providing a good material platform for electrochemical applications. Consequently very large electrochemical capacitance values, as high as 2. 1 mF for a sample of 10 mm(3), were achieved. The electrochemical capacitance of the material exhibits a dependence on bias voltage, a phenomenon observed by other groups when studying graphene quantum capacitance. The plasma-assisted graphitization, which dominates the graphitization process, is analyzed and discussed in detail...|$|R

Micro-Raman spectroscopy, microhardness and X-ray diffraction {{were used for the}} sample characterization. After treatment the CNx material leads to the formation of a number of highly ordered diamond crystals showing an extraordinarily low broadening of the 1332 cm⁻¹ Raman-line (∆n = 2. 43 cm⁻¹). Besides, the Raman spectra of the matrix surrounding the diamond crystals show an additional band at ~ 1621 cm⁻¹ with a Raman intensity that strongly depends on the distance from the crystals. We propose that this band is related to the formation of rombohedral graphite in the treated sample and the corresponding effect of puckering of the graphite layers.
