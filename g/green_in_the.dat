5|$|Green was the {{traditional}} color worn by hunters in the 19th century, particularly the shade called hunter <b>green.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 20th century most hunters began wearing the color olive drab, a shade of green, instead of hunter green.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the rest}} of the 20th century many {{recreation}} facilities were incorporated into the park. Parkland was levelled for football pitches in 1947. A second bowling <b>green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Recreation Grounds was laid out by the City Council in 1962 to join the <b>green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Museum Gardens laid in 1922. In 1972 the two fish ponds were reshaped and deepened to leave one pool (Beacon Pool) we see today. The golf course was laid out and opened in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and <b>green,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; <b>green,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E

5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|Wandsworth Bridge {{crosses the}} River Thames in west London.

5|$|A racehorse {{was named}} after the paper in 1991, which was owned by a {{consortium}} of 250Echo readers. The gelding won races at Hamilton, Redcar, Newcastle upon Tyne and Haydock in the early 1990s, but {{had to be put}} down on 17 February 1996 after pulling up badly lame during a routine morning gallop. The Echo was also used in a display at the Science Museum in London in 1999, to show how writing can be made simpler for people with reading difficulties, and a specially printed edition of the newspaper appeared on the TV show Touching Evil, starring Robson <b>Green,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year.|$|E

5|$|Acton Town is a London Underground {{station in}} the {{south-west}} corner of Acton, west London, in the London Borough of Ealing, close to the border with the London Borough of Hounslow. The station is served by the District and Piccadilly lines and is in Travelcard Zone 3. On the District line, it is between Chiswick Park and Ealing Common stations, and on the Piccadilly line it is between Hammersmith (Turnham <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early mornings and late evenings) and Ealing Common on the Uxbridge branch & South Ealing on the Heathrow branch.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth is {{well known}} for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are {{centered}} on the Green. At Homecoming each fall, a bonfire is constructed on the Green by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a snow sculpture on the <b>Green.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances on the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of fiercely competitive Green Key chariot races.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the college}} {{expanded}} through developments at Owengate and Bailey Court, both around Palace <b>Green.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, the college sold Lumley Castle. The proceeds {{were used to}} fund the development of Moatside Court, and meant that all the college's students were now housed within five minutes of the main castle. During this period there was rapid change in the size {{and structure of the}} college, which expanded to over 300undergraduates by 1979.|$|E

The Greens vote was again a protest vote against the ALP, whom Socialist Alternative characterised as alienating their traditional support base.|$|R
5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many serials the title role was played by a {{different}} actor, this time by André Morell; the part had initially been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated {{with other}} local {{charities}} with similar purposes, {{to form the}} Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village <b>green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium <b>green.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E

5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any <b>green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The second cast of {{the work}} is located in Abingdon Street Gardens (better known as College <b>Green)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City of Westminster. The other {{full-size}} casts are located near the Bloedel Floral Conservatory in Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, donated by Prentice Bloedel; near the Rose Garden of the Rockefeller family house at Kykuit at Tarrytown, New York. Moore donated his artist's copy (0/3) to the Henry Moore Foundation in 1977, and it is displayed at Perry Green, Hertfordshire.|$|E

Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor <b>Green</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E
