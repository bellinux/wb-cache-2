5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding a legion of his own.

Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes.

5|$|The {{original}} edit {{was almost}} three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut {{material from the}} first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> leave it open-ended.|$|E
5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> place his shots, although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E

5|$|According to Byzantine custom, the {{coronation}} of an emperor could only {{take place in}} Constantinople and be performed by the Patriarch; yet Constantinople was still in Latin hands, and the Patriarch (now Germanus II, 1223–40) resided in Nicaea. Theodore thus turned to the Metropolitan of Thessalonica, Constantine Mesopotamites, whom he had just restored to his see after removing the Latin prelate. Mesopotamites however recognized the Patriarch at Nicaea as legitimate, and steadfastly refused to perform the rite, despite pressure from Theodore, his brother Constantine, and John Apokaukos. Rather than submit, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> return to exile. In response, in March 1225 Theodore convened a council of the bishops of his domains at Arta, chaired by Apokaukos. The council approved a declaration, composed by Apokaukos, which extolled Theodore's achievements against the Latins and Bulgarians, his liberation of Greek lands, eviction of Catholic priests and restoration of Orthodox bishops, and his imperial descent, and declared that the council recognized only him as emperor. Armed with this declaration, Theodore had the loyal Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatianos, perform {{the coronation}} instead.|$|E
5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be out playing cricket.|$|E
