This technology involves the next functions: forming of intellectual interface on a natural language to communicate with a control system; joint planning of production and sales to get the maximal profit; an adaptation of control system to internal and external events. The use of the natural language permits to overcome a barrier between the control system and upper managers. To solve posed actual problems of management the selection of information from a database and call to mathematical methods are executed automatically. Optimal planning provides the maximal use of available resources and opportunities of market. Adaptive control implements the efficient reaction to critical events that lead up to a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> and increase of accounts receivable...|$|E

As a result, {{we found that the}} lower cost to sales ratio projects had the higher relative effort ratio in external design phase, which indicates that spending less effort in external design can cause <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit.</b> We also found that high outsourcing ratio projects had higher cost to sales ratio, and that projects having moderate code reuse ratio had lower and disperse cost to sales ratio, which suggests troubles in code reuse can damage the profit of a project.

40|$|The Porter {{hypothesis}} {{suggests a}} double dividend {{in the sense}} that environmental policy improves both environment and competitiveness. The suggestion received strong criticism from economists mainly driven by the idea that if opportunities for higher competitiveness exist firms {{do not have to be}} triggered by an extra cost. Therefore, the trade-off for the government between environmental and other targets remains. In this paper a model is developed which confirms the last point but which also draws the attention to some general mechanisms that relax the trade-off considerably. Downsizing and especially modernization of firms subject to environmental policy will increase average productivity and will have positive effects on the marginal <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> and environmental damage. Concluding, a double dividend can generally not be expected but the trade-off is not so grim as is often suggested. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept and}} {{mathematical}} model of modern economics are formulated {{in which a}} company profit is defined when taking into account possible interests of individual decision makers rather than based exclusively on benefits of either the company (ground of microeconomics) or the whole society (ground of macroeconomics). The authors call this approach “nanoeconomics ” as a terminological step down from macro- and microeconomics. The growing gap between interests of the business owner and decision makers in large corporations is obviously detrimental for the company performance. Here the authors formulate a “physical ” model to describe this situation quantitatively. In this model, the company profit is an accumulative effect made of statistical contributions {{of a variety of}} decisions of individual decision-makers decisions, rather than looking at the company as a whole (microeconomics). The model demonstrates the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> of the companies compared to the microeconomical estimations.

A production emergence, {{an appearance of}} new competitive goods, {{a major change in}} financial state of partners, a radical change in exchange rate, a change in custom and tax legislation, a political and energy crisis, an ecocatastrophe can lead up to a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> or bankruptcy of enterprise. Therefore it is necessary to assess a probability of threat and to take preventive actions. If a critical event took place, one must estimate restoration expenses and possible consequences as well as to prepare appropriate propositions. This is provided using modern methods of diagnostics, prediction, and decision making as well as an inference engine and semantic analysis. Mathematical methods in use are called in algorithms of adaptation automatically. Because the enterprise is a complex system, to overcome complexity of control it is necessary to apply semantic representations. Such representations are formed from descriptions of events, facts, persons, organizations, goods, operations, scripts on a natural language. Semantic representations permit as well to formulate actual problems and to find ways to resolve these problems...|$|E

The managers of these kinds of firms normally have more motivations to satisfy credit providers through profit management. But it seems that auditors and financial providers' more attention to these firms' leads to having more regular managers and decreasing profit management performance. The tested sample includes 136 firms among the accepted ones in Iran Stock Exchange considering a period of eight years from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2007. In order to estimate the rate of profit management performance by the use of Jones adjusted model, the optional committed items were calculated. The hypotheses were tested via regression method. The results demonstrated that the increase of most liabilities causes the <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> management performance. In fact, liability makes managers have less access to free cash flows in order to pay the liability and its interest; therefore, they cannot take advantage of the opportunities such as non-optimization investment, extra cost tolerance and earning waste.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 In {{production}} processes, {{there are}} two types of variations that affect production quality - - variations produced by chance causes and variations produced by assignable causes. One of the main instruments in quality control used to control quality by distinguishing between variations produced by chance causes and a real process change is the control chart. Each type of control chart has advantages and disadvantages in a specified situation. For example, some control charts fail to detect small shifts, while the others are ineffective to detect large shifts in process mean. In this study, three types of control charts, namely, X[bar], cumulative sum, and geometric moving average control charts were compared on an economic basis. A simulation model was developed to simulate the control chart functions in a typical production process. The simulation was executed in BASIC on an IBM PC/XT. Before comparison, each control chart was matched so that all the control charts have the same characteristics when the process operates in-control for a certain period of time. The effects of the type of control chart, sample size, sampling interval, and the magnitude of shift in process mean on profit per hour were observed and analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that, in general, the cumulative sum control chart has advantage over the other two types of control charts when shift of small magnitude of about 0. 5 σ is present. X[bar]-control chart is ineffective to detect small shifts; however, its effectiveness increases sharply as the magnitude of shift increases to values of 1. 5 σ or beyond. Geometric moving average control chart gives best results at intermediate shift levels of about l. 0 σ. Of the three sample sizes (3, 4 and 5) used in this study, sample size of five yields the highest profit per hour. However, too large a sample size may result in a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profit</b> per hour if the testing causes the destruction of items and the cost of sampling per item is very high. Small sampling interval of one hour yields the highest profit per hour among three sampling intervals (1, 2 and 4 hours) used in this study. Too small sampling interval could yield lower profit per hour if the increased cost of more frequent sampling, more investigations caused by false alarms, and more frequent shut down of the production process exceeds the savings from early detection of the shift, particularly, when the cost of sampling, the cost of searching for an assignable cause, and the income per hour of production are very high...|$|E

Next the scientific career and {{the genesis of the}} works of Ricardo are dealt with. The building blocks of his theory are Malthus' law of population and his own theory of land rent. They serve as a basis for developing his original theory of income distribution among the three classes of society (landowners, tenants, agricultural workers). His vision is - like that of Adam Smith - a self-adjusting model of the economy. Getting at first rid of rent, his intention was to show that - in contrast to Smith - a <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> is the result of an increase in wages. Rent is a price determined, but not a price determining factor. The decline <b>of</b> <b>profits</b> reduces capital accumulation and economic growth and ends up in a stationary state of the economy. The precondition of his analysis of income distribution was a theory of value. Ricardo selected the quantity of embodied labour as an invariable measure of value. From a political point of view Ricardo opposed state interventions, such as the corn laws and the poor laws. He had trust in a self-regulating economy, unlike his friend and critic Thomas Malthus...|$|R
