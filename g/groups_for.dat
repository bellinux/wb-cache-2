5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding <b>groups.</b> <b>For</b> example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of <b>groups.</b> <b>For</b> example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> {{most of the}} year. During {{the mating}} period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

40|$|As {{the second}} step to {{constructing}} a new method for a series analysis of traditional milk processing system，"groups of milk processing elements" have been classified in this paper. A group of milk processing elements {{has been defined as}} one unit possessing a common goal-oriented technique among certain milk processing elements. The purpose for a class-structure analysis for the milk processing elements has been to clarify the central goal-oriented intentions of human beings in regards to milk processing. From the results of analysis，the milk processing elements has been classified into three central groups，namely，"a processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> the utilization of milk components"，"a processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> preservation"，and "a processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> separation". The "processing for utilization of milk components" is composed of three sub-groups for processing main milk elements. The "processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> preservation" is a processing <b>group</b> mainly <b>for</b> long preservation under favorable condition. The "processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> separation" is a processing <b>group</b> <b>for</b> physically separating the solids from the liquid in the milk. The traditional milk processing systems of all the tribes can essentially be explained using the above three central groups of milk processing elements. [URL]...|$|R
