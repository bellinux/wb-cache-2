We were thinking {{a lot more about}} what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E

[...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E

He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a step or two ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

2500|$|Spain under Zapatero {{turned its}} focus to Europe from the United States, {{pursuing}} a middle road {{in dealing with}} tensions between Western powers and Islamic populations. In a May 2007 interview with El País, Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, commenting on the overall relationship between Spain and the United States, stated: [...] "We work together very well on some issues. I think the Spanish–American relationship can develop more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>some</b> Spanish officials are knowledgeable and very skilled professionals and we work with them very well. I {{would like to see}} Spain active in the world, working through NATO, active in Afghanistan. You're doing a lot in the Middle East because Moratinos knows a lot about it. But Spain is a big country and your economy is huge. I think Spain can be a force for security and peace and freedom in the world. I believe that Spain has that potential, and that's how I would like to see Spanish–American relations developing." ...|$|E
