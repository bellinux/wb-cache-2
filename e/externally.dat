5|$|Chaulmoogra oil, {{from the}} seeds of Hydnocarpus wightiana, used for many centuries, {{internally}} and <b>externally,</b> to treat leprosy. Also used to treat secondary syphilis, rheumatism, scrofula, and in phthisis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Externally,</b> {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, {{except on the}} nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century addition of a north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. <b>Externally,</b> the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or <b>externally</b> imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is <b>externally</b> imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|He 111 E-4: Half of 2,000kg (4,410lb) bomb load carried <b>externally.</b>|$|E
5|$|He 111 H-5: Similar to H-4, all bombs carried <b>externally,</b> {{internal}} bomb bay {{replaced by}} fuel tank. The variant {{was to be}} a longer range torpedo bomber.|$|E
5|$|He 111 H-6: Torpedo bomber, {{could carry}} two LT F5b torpedoes <b>externally,</b> powered by Jumo 211F-1 engines, had six MG 15s and one MG FF cannon in forward gondola.|$|E
5|$|Methods such as {{industrial}} CT scanning {{can help}} with finding these defects <b>externally</b> as well as internally.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 was {{facelift}}ed July 2008. This facelift {{was mainly}} {{the increase in}} engine power, to 350kW (476hp) and a redesigned centre console. <b>Externally,</b> the DB9 remained virtually unchanged.|$|E
5|$|To {{solve the}} {{remaining}} problems, Viète exploited {{the fact that}} the given circles and the solution circle may be re-sized in tandem while preserving their tangencies (Figure4). If the solution-circle radius is changed by an amount Δr, the radius of its internally tangent given circles must be likewise changed by Δr, whereas the radius of its <b>externally</b> tangent given circles must be changed by −Δr. Thus, as the solution circle swells, the internally tangent given circles must swell in tandem, whereas the <b>externally</b> tangent given circles must shrink, to maintain their tangencies.|$|E
5|$|Traditional poultices {{were made}} by boiling {{medicinal}} plants, wrapping them in a cloth, and applying the resulting parcel <b>externally</b> to the affected part of the body.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Mysida {{were united}} with another, <b>externally</b> similar group of pelagic crustaceans, the Lophogastrida, into a broader order Mysidacea, but that {{classification}} is generally abandoned at present.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 50 of the early-production Mk IIs were {{modified}} into trainers as the Mark III, by adding dual controls and instruments {{for the student}} pilot and an <b>externally</b> braced tailplane.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations {{stem from a}} {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and <b>externally</b> identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not <b>externally</b> represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{concerns}} women is {{the dress code}} expected of them. Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of <b>externally</b> imposed control. Women from other religions are also expected to follow dress codes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British researchers found {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while <b>externally</b> mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|British {{researchers}} {{had found that}} the amount of electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive; and that <b>externally</b> mounted light projectors (following the Canadian approach) unacceptably disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{character}} is strongly driven by {{his desire to}} break from conventions. Brooke's unconventional actions are common throughout the novel, the most prominent being nude bathing and odd remarks and humour. These actions create an <b>externally</b> carefree individual that is in strong contrast to the down-to-earth Nell.|$|E
5|$|Diving bells are {{required}} to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted <b>externally</b> as there is insufficient space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.|$|E
5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles <b>externally,</b> set upon on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted <b>externally</b> would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E
5|$|He 111 P-4: Fitted {{with extra}} armour, three extra MG 15s, and {{provisions}} for two <b>externally</b> mounted bomber racks. Powerplants consisted of DB601A-1s. The internal bomb bay {{was replaced with}} an 835 L fuel tank and a 120 L oil tank. Some H-4s were also fitted with Jumo 211H-1s.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to pupil assessment, {{the law requires}} that schools implement some form of self-evaluation {{on the quality of}} their services {{and to make sure that}} institutions are operating inside the law and within guidelines. Schools are assessed <b>externally</b> every five years by the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been argued that by {{introducing}} an ouster clause into the ISA, an <b>externally</b> imposed restraint on the judiciary, Parliament has exhibited distrust towards the judiciary's ability to exercise self-restraint in dealing with ISA cases.|$|E
5|$|Louse (plural: lice) is {{the common}} name {{for members of the}} order Phthiraptera, which {{contains}} nearly 5,000 species of wingless insect. Lice are obligate parasites, living <b>externally</b> on warm-blooded hosts which include every species of bird and mammal, except for monotremes, pangolins, bats and cetaceans. Lice are vectors of diseases such as typhus.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Merlin's {{technical}} improvements {{resulted from}} more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, {{and the introduction}} of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and <b>externally</b> to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg <b>externally</b> rotated {{in an attempt to}} avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonates {{are mostly}} land {{snails and slugs}} that have {{developed}} a simple lung from the mantle cavity. An <b>externally</b> located opening called the pneumostome allows air {{to be taken into}} the mantle cavity lung.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{today is}} roughly {{halfway through the}} most stable part of its life. It has not changed {{dramatically}} for over four billion years, and will remain fairly stable {{for more than five}} billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both internally and <b>externally.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} most {{dangerous}} if {{taken into the}} body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage <b>externally,</b> through gamma ray emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} MacBook Pro appeared <b>externally</b> {{similar to the}} PowerBook G4, but used Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.|$|E
5|$|The four-storey {{building}} is <b>externally</b> austere. A freestanding cube, the main façade faces Republic Square and is inlaid with Karst marble, with green Oplotnica granite below each window. The only decorative element is the two storey main portal – four oak doors surrounded by statues by Zdenko Kalin and Karel Putrih which represent working people.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then <b>externally</b> fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{version of}} the Baldwin, Lyn - looking <b>externally</b> similar to the 1898 original, but {{employing}} several advanced steam technologies, including roller bearings, welded tanks, Lempor exhaust system, and a high-pressure boiler - was completed in 2017. Its first public steaming took place on 8 July 2017 at Alan Keef Ltd. Lyn was delivered to Woody Bay in September 2017, and first ran there on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} plot involves Merital and {{his desire}} to marry a woman named Helena, cousin to Matchless. He is kept from doing so <b>externally</b> by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the workings of her aunt, and internally by themselves. Against her uncles wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by this, Lady Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the south-west of the castle is a barracks block and associated storage buildings, constructed soon after 1718. Built to replace the original barrack accommodation within the castle when it was redeveloped to convert it into a magazine, it has changed little <b>externally</b> in the last 300 years. It is a rare surviving example of an 18th-century building of this type {{and was one of}} the first distinct barracks to be built in England.|$|E
5|$|A {{user and}} {{development}} community, including {{current and former}} Bell Labs personnel, produced minor daily releases in form of ISO images. Bell Labs hosted the development. The development source tree is accessible over the 9P and HTTP protocols and is used to update existing installations. In addition to the official components of the OS included in the ISOs, Bell Labs also hosts a repository of <b>externally</b> developed applications and tools.|$|E
5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used <b>externally</b> they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to be crushed together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
