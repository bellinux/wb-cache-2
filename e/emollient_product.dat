40|$|Abstract Background Xerosis is {{a common}} skin {{disorder}} frequently observed in diabetic patients. An effective hydration of foot skin in diabetics is a relevant preventive strategy {{in order to maintain}} a healthy foot. Urea is considered an effective hydrating and emollient topical product. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of topical urea 5 % with arginine and carnosine (Ureadin Rx Db, ISDIN Spain) (UC) in comparison with glycerol-based emollient topical product (Dexeryl, Pierre Fabre) (EC), in Type 2 diabetic patients. Methods We assessed the effect of UC on skin hydration in a randomized, evaluator-blinded comparative study in 40 type II diabetic patients, aged 40 – 75 years, treated with UC or the comparator for 28 days with a twice-daily application. The principal outcomes were the Dryness Area Severity Index (DASI) Score and the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for skin dryness evaluated at baseline and at the end of study period by an investigator unaware of treatment allocation. Results UC induced significantly greater hydration than EC with an 89 % reduction in DASI score (from 1. 6 to 0. 2; p[*] Conclusion Application of urea 5 %, arginine and carnosine cream increases skin hydration and alleviates the condition of skin dryness in Type 2 diabetic patients in comparison with a control glycerol-based <b>emollient</b> <b>product.</b> (Dutch Trials Register trial number 3328). </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the potential efficacy of a topical product based {{on a combination of}} natural active ingredients on the reduction of the effects induced on the skin by radiotherapy. The product has been formulated accordingly to the most recent innovations of natural excipients and botanical actives. The combination of active ingredients comprises: a specific boswellia resin extract, standardized in boswellic acids, which are recognized potent anti-inflammatory compounds, formulated in a specific delivery system which was shown to ameliorate skin affinity; a specific lipophilic fraction of Sichuan pepper containing alpha hydroxyl-sanshool, a skin sensitivity modulator; a polysaccharide from tamarind with objectivized hydrating properties. The emulsifying, as well as the preservative system of the formulation, are once again of natural origin. Finally, the overall texture of the product results very light and easy to spread ameliorating the compliance of patients and the use on challenged skin areas. This experimental, double blind controlled trial, foresees the pre-application of the product one week prior {{to the beginning of the}} radiotherapy protocol once a day, twice daily during the radiotherapy treatment and again once a day in the two following weeks. The panel of enrolled patients comprises 40 women randomly assigned to the active group and 40 women randomly assigned to the best available treatment group, being this an <b>emollient</b> <b>product</b> standard-of-care used by the hospital. The skin toxicity induced by the treatment is evaluated by the clinical RTOG scoring system, and the severity and timing for the onset of the erythema represents the primary endpoint of the study. An additional primary endpoint is the overall quality of life of the patients which is evaluated by a scientific tool developed by the University of Padua, the “Padua Skin-related QoL Questionnaire” whose data collection and interpretation is followed by psychologists. Additionally, a score defined as PGIC (Patient’s Global Impression of Change) has been collected to evaluate the perceived amelioration and skin care support...|$|E

Patients and methods: This double-blind, randomized, comparative {{study was conducted with}} 60 patients with moderate AD. Before starting the study, participants were pretreated for 15  days with drug therapy to improve their SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) by at least 25 %. On Day 1, the eligible patients were randomized to either the emollient containing LRP-VFB associated with mannose (Product A) or another <b>emollient</b> (<b>product</b> B) and were treated twice daily for 1  month. Recurrence of flare-ups and microbial communities were characterized from swabs taken at Day 1 and Day 28, under axenic conditions, from affected (AF) and proximal unaffected (UAF) skin areas. Results: At Day 1, the average SCORAD of each group and the microbial communities of AF and UAF areas for each participant were similar. One month {{after the end of the}} therapeutic treatment (Day 28), the average evolution of SCORAD at Day 28 compared to Day 1 of patients treated with product A was significantly lower than that of the patients treated with product B. A significantly increased level of Xanthomonas genus was noticed in the group treated with product A (versus product B). On the other hand, the level of Staphylococcus genus increased between Day 1 and Day 28 in the group treated with product B, but not in the group treated with product A. Interestingly, these differences were more pronounced for patients in relapse, and the associated SCORAD worsening was less in the group treated with product A versus the group treated with product B. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a specific emollient containing a biomass of non-pathogenic bacteria Vf grown in a medium containing TSW and associated with a selected carbon source is able to normalize skin microbiota and significantly reduce the number and severity of flare-ups compared with another emollient.

Aims To assess, using noninvasive biophysical tests, the clinical and instrumental effectiveness of a hydrating gel-cream compared with placebo as an adjuvant to isotretinoin for treatment of facial skin in patients with inflammatory acne. Methods Prospective, double-blind, randomized study, using MULTI SKIN MC 750, on the adjuvant effect of a hydrating gel-cream for acne (active product) vs. a gel-cream without active substances (placebo). Follow-up lasted 3 months. Results Sixty-six patients were included. Thirty-four were administered the active product, and 32 placebo. Though the number of lesions fell significantly in both groups, {{the mean number of}} papules on day 30 was significantly lower in the active product group. The active product group showed a significant increase in hydration, while the placebo group showed a significant increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Seborrhoea decreased significantly in both groups; there were no differences between them. Conclusions Compared with placebo, the specific gel-cream with active products as an adjuvant to oral isotretinoin improved hydration, prevented TEWL increase, and reduced inflammatory acne lesions after 30 days...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ichthyoses are genetic {{disorders}} of keratinization {{which are}} uncomfortable {{due to their}} conspicuous scaling, itching and cosmetic problems. Ichthyoses can lead to social discrimination and psychological problems. Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) {{is the most common}} form of these geno-dermatoses. IV is a chronic disorder that often requires continuous therapy. <b>Emollient</b> and keratolytic <b>products</b> are the mainstay treatments of IV. It is important that efficient, safe and well tolerated therapies should be available. Direct comparative data regarding efficacy of different <b>emollient</b> <b>products</b> in IV patients are very few. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the keratolytic and moisturizing properties as well as the tolerance of a new urea topical formulation (Ureadin Rx 10) when applied to hyperkeratotic and dry skin in patients with (IV) in comparison with a standard emollient cream. Methods: The study was conducted as a two-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind, intra-patient (right-vs. -left) trial design. A total of 30 patients with IV between 8 and 65 (mean age: 25 years) treated with a 10 % urea-based lotion, Ureadin Rx 10 * (URx), for 4 weeks or a glycerol-based emollient cream, Dexeryl dagger (DC), in a right-vs. -left study design. Primary outcome was a 5 -point SRRC Index score (evaluating scaling roughness, redness and cracks) evaluated at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. As secondary endpoints patients evaluated also the global efficacy (GE) and global tolerability (GT) scores with the help of a 10 cm visual analogue scale (0 = no efficacy at all/very bad tolerability; 10 : excellent efficacy/excellent tolerability). Results: At baseline the mean (SD) SRRC score was 9. 5 (1. 9) in the URx treated sites and 9. 5 (1. 9) in the DC treated sites. A total of 27 patients (90 %) concluded the study period. Three patients were withdrawn prematurely because of itching and burning sensation after DC application (1 patient) or URx application (2 patients). At week 4, in comparison with baseline values, both treatments were shown to be clinically effective: SRRC significantly (p = 0. 0001) decreased to 3. 3 (1. 8) after URx (a 65 % relative reduction) and to 5. 7 (2. 5) after DC (a 40 % relative reduction). SRRC was significantly lower in URx treated regions in comparison with DC both after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment (p = 0. 0005). Mean GE score in areas treated with URx was significantly (p = 0. 0001) higher than in the areas treated with the DC (8. 9 vs. 7. 3). Both treatments were in general well tolerated. GT score was 8. 1 (range 10 to 3) with URx and 8. 4 (range 10 to 3) with DC application (p = ns). The two main limitations of this trial are the study design (single blind), and the small sample size which is not adequate for an evaluation of safety. Conclusion: Ureadin Rx 10 lotion has shown a greater efficacy on ichthyosis vulgaris in term of reduction of scaling, roughness, redness and cracking in comparison with a glycerol-based emollient cream. Tolerability of the two topical treatments was comparable. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for the evaluation of safety and tolerability of urea 10 % lotion in this clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} study is to demonstrate the benefits of using specialized cosmetic products as part of basic skin care for children with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The epidermal barrier dysfunction {{is known to be}} the leading factor in pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and it manifests as dry skin, imbalance in the composition of lipids of the stratum corneum and water-lipid mantle and alterations in the activity of proteases. Due to xerosis, the skin gets easily affected by allergens, irritants and pathogenic microorganisms, which triggers the "itch-scratch" cycle and can lead to AD exacerbation and significantly deteriorate {{the quality of life of}} the patient. The basic skin care using the moisturizing and soothing cosmetic <b>products</b> (<b>emollients)</b> is acknowledged by all major Guidelines for treatment of AD as an important part of therapy. Significant improvements in skin status as well as the child's well-being can be achieved with use of this simple to understand skin care algorithm that includes proper skin cleansing, moisturizing and itch prevention...|$|R

Methods: Primary efficacy endpoints were improvement in transepidermal water loss, hydration, skin elasticity and firmness, erythema, and skin roughness and smoothness as measured using the versions of Tewameter, Corneometer, Cutometer, Mexameter, and Visioscan VC 98, respectively. The cream was applied twice daily by 32 participants to an area of one forearm unaffected by eczema, while the same area of the other forearm {{was used as a}} control. Measurements were taken at day 0 and day 14. Secondary endpoints assessed the acceptability of the product. Results: At the end of 2 weeks, transepidermal water loss, hydration, skin elasticity and firmness, erythema, and skin roughness and smoothness improved. All changes were statistically significant (p< 0. 01). The rate of satisfaction with the emollient properties was 82 %, and the rate of absorption into the skin was 88 %. Results show that the emollient hydrates and repairs eczema-prone skin with high levels of acceptability. Keywords: eczema, Suvex, moisturizer, emollient, hydration, skin barrier functio...|$|R
