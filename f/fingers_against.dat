5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
25|$|Muffled or mute tone (tono ahogado): {{like the}} open tone, {{is made by}} {{striking}} the drum with the four fingers, but holding the <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the head to muffle the tone.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{method of}} {{muffling}} {{is to place}} the pads of the <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb and index finger. Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.|$|E
60|$|He put his <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> it {{as though}} he had come across it accidentally.|$|R
60|$|Then he returned, {{rubbing his}} sticky <b>finger</b> dry <b>against</b> his breeches. He stood near to Lettie, {{and she felt}} rather than saw the {{extraordinary}} pale cleanness of the one finger among the others. She rubbed her <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> her dress in painful sympathy.|$|R

25|$|Sometimes, modern beatboxers {{will use}} their hand or {{another part of}} their body to extend the {{spectrum}} of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which {{is commonly known as}} the 'crab scratch'. Another hand technique includes the 'throat tap' which involves the beatboxer tapping their <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> their throat as they throat sing or hum.|$|E
25|$|Although psychic surgery {{varies by}} region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without {{the use of}} a {{surgical}} instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of his/her <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the patient's skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner's hands appear to penetrate into the patient's body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient's body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient's skin showing no wounds or scars.|$|E
500|$|Adams' {{career began}} when he found his {{aptitude}} for bowling translated to the playing of billiards. One day when he was 25 years old, he picked up some billiard balls and began to [...] "bowl" [...] {{on the table and}} soon discovered he could manipulate the balls with great accuracy in this manner. Largely self-taught, Adams thereafter amassed a large repertoire of finger billiards shots. He engaged a manager and began to give performances, his first was at an engagement in New York City. Later, Adams traveled extensively, giving exhibitions and taking on challengers in cities across the United States and some in Europe. During his travels, Adams performed before the Vanderbilts, the Goulds, three U.S. Presidents, the Prince of Wales in London, and the Comte de Paris in Paris. One of the largest matches ever played of any form of billiards took place at Manhattan's Gilmore's Gardens in 1878. Adams played using his <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> William Sexton, the reigning cue champion of the world, who used a cue; Adams won the three-day competition in the game of straight rail.|$|E
50|$|Palpation (also {{known as}} digital tonometry) is {{the method of}} {{estimating}} intraocular pressure by gently pressing the index <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> the cornea of a closed eye. This method is notoriously unreliable.|$|R
50|$|These {{workers are}} messing up Deepak's life and business, but he can't raise a <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> them, {{for they are}} under the {{cushioned}} wings of the Union Leader Mr. Singh (Murli Sharma).|$|R

2500|$|Some line {{drawings}} of Harris and other {{players of the}} 1790s have survived. Harris {{is shown in the}} characteristic pose described by Nyren as he began his action, standing erect with the ball raised over his head. The ball when delivered was pitched very fast and accurately. Harris seems to have got [...] "pace off the pitch" [...] and Nyren has recorded that numerous batsmen received nasty injuries to their unprotected hands from balls that trapped their (ungloved) <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the bat handle.|$|E
60|$|Anna drummed impatiently {{with her}} <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> {{the arm of}} her chair.|$|E
6000|$|She {{held the}} telegram, {{flipping}} her <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> {{one end of}} it as she debated. She remembered how the wide world had flowed toward her over {{the hood of the}} Gomez all day. She wrote in answer: ...|$|E
25|$|After the gunfight, Travis {{attempts}} suicide, but {{has run out}} {{of ammunition}} and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> his temple pantomiming the act of shooting himself.|$|R
6000|$|Jasper laid a long <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> {{his nose}} and his eyes grew cunning. [...] "I thought I'd warn you, sir, so as you may bid Sir Oliver look to hisself. 'Tis a fine seaman and fine seamen be none so plentiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mart is just fool {{enough and}} {{contrary}} {{enough to leave}} every cent of his money to her." [...] Here he placed one <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> his brow. [...] "Carlos, here is where you get busy. It's us to the haberdasher. We shine." ...|$|R
60|$|Excitement grew {{upon her}} now, a febrile {{nervousness}} which {{caused her to}} pull at the lock, to bruise her <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the gilt ornaments of the panel, whilst her voice, hoarse and broken with sobs, rent with its echoes the peace and solemnity of the night.|$|E
60|$|In reply {{she pressed}} her open <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> his lips, placed them graciously and playfully, and in {{expectancy}} of the kiss that of old {{had always been a}} consequence. But there was no caressing answer of Martin's lips. He waited until the fingers were removed and then went on.|$|E
60|$|Festus gloomily {{returned}} to his uncle's room and found that Anne was just leaving. He was inclined to follow her at once, but as she gave him no opportunity for doing this {{he went to the}} window, and remained tapping his <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> the shutter while she crossed the yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! That is naught." [...] And Florimond {{snapped a}} strong <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> a {{stronger}} thumb. [...] "But whom {{have you with}} you?" [...] he asked, and his eyes took the measure of Fortunio, standing a pace or two behind his master.|$|R
50|$|On 27 May 2014, Jensen {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} at Crawley Town under manager John Gregory. He was Crawley's second signing of the 2014-15 season. The former Burnley shot-stopper made 20 appearances for The Reds before dislocating his <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> MK Dons in January 2015.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Try once more,' said she, and {{she laid}} a <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> {{the tree and}} bade him put his foot on it. Then she placed another finger a little higher up, and so on till he reached the top, where the magpie had built her nest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Waiting--waiting--everything is waiting," [...] she whispered. She {{drew her}} hand from his, pressed her clenched <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> her lips. She {{was lost in the}} somberness. [...] "I am happy--so we must go home, before we have time to become unhappy. But can't we sit on a log for a minute and just listen?" ...|$|E
60|$|Others heard, too, and saw, {{from the}} {{darkness}} of their huts--bold warriors, hideously painted, grasping heavy war spears in nerveless <b>fingers.</b> <b>Against</b> Numa, the lion, they would have charged fearlessly. Against many times their own number of black warriors would they have raced {{to the protection of}} their chief; but this weird jungle demon filled them with terror. There was nothing human in the bestial growls that rumbled up from his deep chest; there was nothing human in the bared fangs, or the catlike leaps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw, Pinney! You'd grow a {{bush for}} the {{pleasure}} of beating about it." [...] Maxwell hung his hat on a hook above the table, but sat down fronting Pinney with his overcoat on; it was a well-worn overcoat, irredeemably shabby at the buttonholes. [...] "I'd like some tea," [...] he said to the hostess, [...] "some English breakfast tea, if you have it; and a little toast." [...] He rested his elbows on the table, and took his head between his hands, and pressed his <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> his temples.|$|E
6000|$|... "You puzzle me," [...] Julien admitted. [...] "You {{talk about}} revenge. I know you far too well {{to believe that}} you would propose to me any scheme which would involve the raising even of my little <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> the country which has turned me out." ...|$|R
60|$|He searched out her solar plexus, and did no {{more than}} snap his middle <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> it. This time she {{experienced}} a simple paralysis, accompanied by a stoppage of breath, but with a brain and vision that remained perfectly clear. In a moment, however, all the unwonted sensations were gone.|$|R
60|$|The threat sounded awful, {{but did not}} alarm Jo, for {{she knew}} the irascible old gentleman would never lift a <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> his grandson, {{whatever}} he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my hawk!" [...] I looked {{round to}} see that the falcon on her wrist had in some way loosed itself, or been loosed, and being hooded, had fallen to the ground where one of the dogs was trying to catch and kill it. Now there was great confusion, the eyes of all being fixed upon the hawk and the dog, in the midst of which the lady Blanche very quietly turned her head, and lifting her hand as though to see how the hawk had fallen from it, with a swift {{movement}} laid her <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> her lips and threw a kiss to me.|$|E
6000|$|The by-standers began now {{to look at}} each other, nod, wink significantly, and tap their <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> their foreheads. There was a whisper, also, about {{securing}} the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief; at the very suggestion of which, the self-important man with the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical moment a fresh, comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began to cry. [...] "Hush, Rip," [...] cried she, [...] "hush, you little fool; the old man won't hurt you." [...] The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of recollections in his mind.|$|E
60|$|Then she led Theseus {{along by}} the hand until {{they came to a}} dark, shadow grove, where the {{moonlight}} wasted itself on the tops of the trees, without shedding hardly so much as a glimmering beam upon their pathway. After going a good way through this obscurity, they reached a high, marble wall, which was overgrown with creeping plants, that made it shaggy with their verdure. The wall seemed to have no door, nor any windows, but rose up, lofty, and massive, and mysterious, and was neither to be clambered over, nor, so far as Theseus could perceive, to be passed through. Nevertheless, Ariadne did but press one of her soft little <b>fingers</b> <b>against</b> a particular block of marble, and, though it looked as solid as any other part of the wall, it yielded to her touch, disclosing an entrance just wide enough to admit them. They crept through, and the marble stone swung back into its place.|$|E
50|$|On December 30, 2008, Harris {{injured his}} <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> Seton Hall and needed six stitches. He missed the {{following}} game against South Florida. In Syracuse's epic 127-117 win against Connecticut in {{the quarterfinals of the}} Big East Tournament on March 12, 2009, Harris played 56 minutes, scored 29 points and grabbed 22 rebounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quite O. K.," [...] said Joe; [...] "I {{used to call}} here regular when I was travellin' in breeches. Where the {{commercials}} are gathered together the tap is good," [...] he added, laying a <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> {{the side of his}} nose. [...] "And they've a fine brand of pickles. Here's your coupon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{replied the}} girl; [...] "but {{in this case}} I think you had better write." [...] She kept {{slipping}} Ehrhardt's letter up and down between her thumb and <b>finger</b> <b>against</b> {{the palm of her}} left hand, and delayed giving it to him, as if she wished him to say something first.|$|R
