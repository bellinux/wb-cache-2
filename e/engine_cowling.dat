5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the oil cooler was {{relocated}} underneath the <b>engine</b> <b>cowling.</b> Fitted with a radio compass and gun camera. Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> latches.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The I-211 was {{a direct}} descendent of the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210 high-altitude fighter prototype, {{also known as the}} MiG-3-82 or MiG-9. Late in 1941, a {{decision}} was made to phase out production of the Mikulin AM-35A engine used by the MiG-1 and MiG-3 in favor of the Mikulin AM-38 engine used in the Ilyushin Il-2. The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, but the redesign of the <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 when it first flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's radio call sign of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

50|$|Five {{minutes before}} the Concorde departed, a Continental Airlines DC-10 heading for Newark, New Jersey took off from the same runway and lost a {{titanium}} alloy strip (part of the <b>engine</b> <b>cowl,</b> identified as a wear strip) that was about 435 mm long, 29 to 34 mm wide and 1.4 mm thick.|$|R
25|$|The second series totalled 19 Breda (4246-4264) and 24 IMAM (MM:5486-5509) {{machines}} {{fitted with}} small <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> rings. There was a limited evolution in this series, {{with the second}} series mainly being sent straight to the scrapyard.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} 275hp (210kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a nose radiator, driving a four-bladed wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper <b>engine</b> <b>cowling</b> dropped smoothly away from the upper wing leading edge.|$|E
25|$|Improved version, with a {{redesigned}} <b>engine</b> <b>cowling,</b> a new windscreen {{structure with}} an integral bulletproof windscreen, new ailerons and strengthened tail surfaces; {{powered by a}} 2,200hp (1,640kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-10W (-W denotes Water Injection) radial piston engine.|$|E
50|$|The Constitution had {{operational}} difficulties which prevented it from meeting its original design objectives. The large airframe needed {{more power than}} the four Pratt & Whitney R-4360s could deliver, and the engines had cooling problems. While this could be compensated for by flying with <b>engine</b> <b>cowl</b> flaps partially open, it increased drag and decreased range.|$|R
