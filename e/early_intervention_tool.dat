40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is one of}} the most debilitating psychological disorders affecting United States soldiers and veterans who have been exposed to combat. Treatments for PTSD include psychological debriefing, which has been criticized lately for its questionable efficacy, and imaginal exposure therapy, which is problematic in that some PTSD sufferers are unable to engage well enough to elicit the necessary response. The weaknesses inherent in these treatments have created a pressing need for alternatives. One promising option is to utilize virtual reality graded exposure therapy (VRGET). The Virtual Reality Medical Center (VRMC) is currently conducting research, funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), studying virtual reality therapy as an <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> for PTSD. Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new technology with healthcare applications being developed for surgical procedures, medical therapy, preventative medicine, rehabilitation, and medical education and training. VR has also been shown to be highly effective as a psychotherapeutic tool. It is often used to distract patients during painful medical procedures, or to provide graded exposure during treatment for anxiety disorders, suc...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 27 - 32) Due to {{the alarming}} increase of childhood obesity, its related medical conditions, and complications of treatments options, {{the importance and}} need for preventive measures is evident. Nutrition education, utilized as an <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>tool,</b> can be beneficial in preventing childhood obesity. The purpose of this graduate project {{was to develop a}} pilot program that included nutrition lessons, physical activity, and cooking sessions to provide a curriculum for children ages 8 -to- 11 years old, in the hope of increasing nutrition knowledge that may help improve their lifestyle habits. The Healthy Eating Summer Camp for Kids was implemented through the Summer Academic Program for Elementary School Students (SAPESS) on California State University, Northridge campus. The curriculum included lesson plans, cooking sessions and physical activity, which were tailored to each food group of the Food Guide Pyramid for each week of the five week long course. The three learning theories, cognitivism [cognitive], humanism [affective], and behaviorism [psycho-motor] were implemented throughout the course. The same pre- and post-tests were administered {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the curriculum regarding students' nutrition knowledge status. This project was successful in evaluating the effectiveness of the nutrition education component of the curriculum. Knowledge was most increased regarding the students' ability to identify the different types of dairy, to recall specific foods in the grain group that were emphasized in the curriculum, and the appropriate daily intake of foods in the grain group. Conclusions regarding the impact of the physical activity and cooking session components of the program on students' knowledge cannot be made at this time, as they were not evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} {{movement}} and cognition is not new, but remains steeped in {{controversy in the}} educational community. One {{of the reasons for}} this controversy has been the lack of substantial research that supports the link between movement programs and observable academic benefits. The results of recent research have indicated that the retention of primary reflexes, particularly the tonic neck reflexes in young children, can result in difficulties that affect the overall functioning of the child. The retainment of reflexes may lead to clumsiness, poor eye hand coordination, poor manipulative skills and consequently academic achievement may be compromised in some children (Sugden 2 ̆ 6 Wright, 1998). This research is about determining the efficacy of Primary Movement program, a reflex replication program designed to reduce the effect of these inappropriately retained reflexes (McPhillips, Hepper 2 ̆ 6 Mulhern, 2000). The research began by investigating the prevalence of retained Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex (ATNR), the cause of significant motor difficulties, in a sample of approximately 200 preprimary children in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia using the Schilder Neurological Test {{which is one of the}} standard neurological tests to determine the presence of this reflex (McPhillips, Hepper, 2 ̆ 6 Mulhern, 2000; Morrison, 1985). EJaseline data was also established for all children in the following areas: motor skills (using Movement ABC Assessment Battery for Children (Henderson 2 ̆ 6 Sugden, 1992); language skills (using Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn 2 ̆ 6 Dunn, 1997); and visual motor integration (using the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (Beery, 1989). Following the gathering of this data, an intervention based on the Primary Movement program was then conducted. The effect of the Primary Movement intervention was· compared on the above variables, to the results of a gross motor intervention and a free play intervention (control). As such this thesis investigates the efficacy of the Primary Movement program as an <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> for preschool children in Australia displaying retained reflexes and associated issues such as motor difficulties, is evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Realize {{that the}} Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU) staff is {{unfamiliar}} and uncomfortable with <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>tools</b> like the IFSP. Your first step {{will be to}} educate the medical community about <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> services, programs, and options. One roadblock that may arise is the fear from medical professionals in "labeling " NICU graduates as "handicapped. " Many others may {{say that it is}} virtually impossible to make a diagnosis of developmental delay in the neonatal stage. This is where you would begin the educational process of Part C within IDEA. If you are not completely familiar with the federal standards and regulations, obtain a copy and study it. This will help you to clearly state the guidelines to medical professionals when they question the validity of your transitional coalition. The eligibility list for screening and tracking of infants at risk developmentally also includes children with: • Birth weight under 1500 grams • Received care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) • Born to a chemically-dependent mother If you have never seen a Level III neonatal intensive care unit, plan to visit one before you begin your coalition building. Set up a meeting with the neonatal department head and tell them about your coalition plans and solicit their support. Tour the NICU and meet with the NICU staff and the families who are currently there. If possible conduct your own needs assessment to discover possible "gaps " in the system that you and the medical community may not be familiar with. Each community and its programs are different; therefore, each community needs its own individualized transitional plan. STEP TWO: IDENTIFY THE PLAYERS The next step in building a coalition is to identify those individuals who are a connection to the family within the scope of medicine as well as <b>early</b> <b>intervention.</b> Many hospitals will also maintain a neonatal follow-up clinic for infants at risk medically and developmentally.

40|$|BackgroundAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians {{experience}} a greater {{burden of disease}} compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Around one-fifth of the health disparity is caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite the importance of absolute cardiovascular risk assessment (CVRA) as a screening and <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>tool,</b> few studies have reported its use within the Australian Indigenous primary health care (PHC) sector. This study utilizes data from a large-scale quality improvement program to examine variation in documented CVRA as a primary prevention strategy for individuals without prior CVD across four Australian jurisdictions. We also examine the proportion with elevated risk and follow-up actions recorded. MethodsWe undertook cross-sectional analysis of 2, 052 client records from 97 PHC centers to assess CVRA in Indigenous adults aged ≥ 20 [*]years with no recorded chronic disease diagnosis (2012 – 2014). Multilevel regression was used to quantify the variation in CVRA attributable to health center and client level factors. The main outcome measure was the proportion of eligible adults who had CVRA recorded. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of clients with elevated risk that had follow-up actions recorded. ResultsApproximately 23 % (n[*]=[*] 478) of eligible clients had documented CVRA. Almost all assessments (99 %) were conducted in the Northern Territory. Within this jurisdiction, there was wide variation between centers {{in the proportion of}} clients with documented CVRA (median 38 %; range 0 – 86 %). Regression analysis showed health center factors accounted for 48 % of the variation. Centers with integrated clinical decision support systems were more likely to document CVRA (OR 21. 1; 95 % CI 5. 4 – 82. 4; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Eleven percent (n[*]=[*] 53) of clients were found with moderate/high CVD risk, of whom almost one-third were under 35 [*]years (n[*]=[*] 16). Documentation of follow-up varied with respect to the targeted risk factor. Fewer than 30 % with abnormal blood lipid or glucose levels had follow-up management plans recorded. ConclusionThere was wide variation in CVRA between jurisdictions and between PHC centers. Learnings from successful interventions to educate and support centers in CVRA provision should be shared with stakeholders more widely. Where risk has been identified, further improvement in follow-up management is required to prevent CVD onset and reduce future burden in Australia’s Indigenous population...|$|E

40|$|The {{questions}} of {{how best to}} support children’s behaviour and their emotional well-being in schools are pervasive ones, but are rarely treated simultaneously within the United Kingdom. The efficacy of two forms of a planning <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> to support these {{in a way which}} could address internalizing as well and externalizing emotional needs, which could promote <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> and which was sustainable in schools was explored in the present Case Study. The planning <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> was based on principles of Multi-Element Plans (MEPS) and Target Monitoring and Evaluation (TME); an alternative form also included an explicit section on exploring the reasons underlying behaviour (ERB) in line with principles of Functional Analysis (FA). The efficacy of the alternative forms of the planning <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> was explored for twelve children across two primary schools, within the framework of a multiple-embedded case study. Data from scaling (TME), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the School Children’s Happiness Inventory, and interviews with school staff and the children themselves were analysed using a combination of descriptive, statistical and thematic analyses. Findings suggested that the planning <b>intervention</b> <b>tool</b> supported positive outcomes overall for the children, as well as the adults involved in the study, and indicated particular facilitatory as well as limiting features.

40|$|Tobacco use is {{prevalent}} in adolescents and understanding {{factors that contribute}} to smoking uptake remains a critical public health priority. While there is now good support for the role of implicit (preconscious) cognitive processing in accounting for changes in drug use, these models have not been applied to tobacco use. Longitudinal analysis of smoking data presents unique problems, because these data are usually highly positively skewed (with excess zeros) and render conventional statistical tools (e. g., OLS regression) largely inappropriate. This study advanced the application of implicit memory theory to adolescent smoking by adopting statistical methods that do not rely on assumptions of normality, and produce robust estimates from data with correlated observations. The study examined the longitudinal association of implicit tobacco-related memory associations (TMAs) and smoking in 114 Australian high school students. Participants completed TMA tasks and behavioural checklists designed to obscure the tobacco-related focus of the study. Results showed that the TMA−smoking association remained significant when accounting for within-subject variability, and TMAs at Time 1 were modestly associated with smoking at Time 2 after accounting for within subject variability. Students with stronger preconscious smoking-related associations appear to be at greater risk of smoking. Strategies that target implicit TMAs may be an effective <b>early</b> <b>intervention</b> or prevention <b>tool.</b> The statistical method will be of use in future research on adolescent smoking, and for research on other behavioural distributions that are highly positively skewed...|$|R
