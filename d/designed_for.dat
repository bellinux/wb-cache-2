5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E

In many fields (e.g., very-large-scale integration (VLSI) and nanoelectronics) X may represent several traits or features including: manufacturability, power, variability, cost, yield, or reliability. This {{gives rise to the}} terms <b>design</b> <b>for</b> manufacturability (DfM, DFM), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> variability (DfV), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> cost (DfC).

5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were <b>{{designed}}</b> <b>for</b> Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
