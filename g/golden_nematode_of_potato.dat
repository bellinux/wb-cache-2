40|$|Abstract Globodera pallida is a {{parasitic}} root cyst <b>nematode</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> {{which causes}} reduction of crop yield and quality in infested fields.

Eighty-two DNA sequences representing the two marker regions for Meloidogyne species were submitted to GenBank to facilitate evaluation of marker variability. Sufficient 18 S variation was observed among some Meloidogyne species to aid in identification; however, nucleotide sequence from this highly conserved region of 18 S did not discriminate among M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. javanica. The mitochondrial gene region provided greater species discrimination and revealed intraspecific variation among many isolates. One nucleotide substitution found in a subset of M. hapla isolates from west Texas and New Mexico affected a DraI restriction site used in the PCR/RFLP diagnostic protocol.

The importance of the detection of G. ellingtonae on potatoes in the Andean region is not restricted to a regional level, since the nematode is also present in USA. This species can pose a serious problem to potato crop, especially when infected tubers are used as seeds.

50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>nematode</b> {{negatively}} affects {{plants of}} the family Solanaceae by forming cysts on the roots of susceptible species.

Heavy infestations can lead to reduced root systems, water stress, and nutrient deficiencies, while indirect effects of an infestation include premature senescence and increased susceptibility to fungal infections. Symptoms <b>of</b> <b>golden</b> <b>nematode</b> infestation are not unique, and thus identification of the pest is usually performed through testing of soil samples.

Farmers were provided with a small financial compensation to help them manage during the proposed eradication process. Following the quarantine, infested lands were fumigated with a pesticide called dichloropropenedichloropropane at least twice.|$|R
40|$|Potato cyst {{nematodes}} (PCN) are {{the most}} economically important <b>nematode</b> pests <b>of</b> <b>potato.</b> Early harvesting {{is part of a}} preventive management approach for very early potato varieties. In Belgium, tubers are harvested before 20 June because it is assumed that no cyst formation occurs by that date. However, this assumption might not be valid any more because of climate change, the availability of new cultivars (with new traits), and the increasing prevalence of Globodera pallida. Therefore, pot, microplot and field trials were conducted to study the life cycle of PCN in early potato-growing conditions. The development of populations of G. pallida on three potato cultivars, Eersteling (susceptible to PCN), Premiere (resistant to G. rostochiensis) and Ambassador (partially resistant to G. pallida) and that of G. rostochiensis on cv. Eersteling was monitored in the growth chamber with simulation of field temperatures of the season. On cvs Eersteling and Premiere, second-stage juveniles (J 2), males, females and cysts of G. pallida populations were found 28, 56, 63 and 77 days after infestation with cysts (DAI), respectively. The number of degree days (DD) for G. pallida to complete its life cycle using a base temperature of 4 degrees C was calculated 450 DD 4. On cv. Ambassador, females of G. pallida were never observed. J 2, males, females and cysts of G. rostochiensis were detected 42, 70, 70 and 84 DAI, respectively. This species needed 398 DD 6 at a base temperature of 6 degrees C to complete its life cycle. Observations in two fields and in microplots under prevailing weather conditions in 2013 revealed that cysts of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis were formed on June 12, when the accumulated degree days were 463 DD 4 and 401 DD 6, respectively. Our observations show that both species of Globodera develop earlier than was assumed based on previous data.

Such attempts brought some remarkable achievments in improving root yield, starch content and resistance to the <b>nematodes</b> <b>of</b> sweet <b>potato.</b> Some wild plants in polyploid series may have many genes potentially important for further improvement of the agronomic traits. However, the genomic relationship between the wild relatives and hexaploid sweet potato (2 n= 6 x= 90) has been unrevealed. Meiotic studies were carried out on the hexaploids synthesized with diploids and tetraploids and on the F_ 1 hybrids, when possible, with sweet potato. Chromosomes in pollen mother cells (PMC's) and root tip cells were fixed in New-comer's solution and stained according to Feulgen reaction with Schiff's reagent. The present report was concerned wlth two kinds of the synthetic hexaploids. The first was the hexaploids derived from chromosome doubling of triploid hybrids between Ipomoea lacunosa (K 61, 2 n= 30) and I. tiliacea (K 134, 2 n= 60). the synthetic hexaploid exhibited mostly regular meiosis with bivalents at the metaphase I stage (MI), and it was considered an allo- or segmental allo-hexaploid. The synthetic hexaploids were fertile, but failure in obtaining hybrids by crosses with sweet potato suggested a critical reproductive barrier between them. The second synthetic hexaploids with 2 x I, trifida (K 221, 2 n= 30) and 4 x I,trifida (K 233, 2 n= 60) showed the chromosome configurations characterized by the occurrence of tetravalents and hexavalents. Such multivalent associations, high in frequency and number per cell, suggested the presence of the genomes at least in quadruplicate. Similar pattern of the chromosome configura-tions was observed in a cultivar <b>of</b> sweet <b>potato</b> and the F_ 1 hybrid between the synthetic hexaploid and sweet potato. Consequently, the genomic formula for sweet potato was proposed as B 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2, in which B 1 B 1 was given to 2 x I. trifida and B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2 to 4 x I. trifida. However, it is necessary to clarify the degree of homology between B 1 and B 2 genomes for more conclusive genomic constitution <b>of</b> sweet <b>potato.</b> A brief account was given for the taxonomic identification of the wild Ipomoea strains used in the present study. サツマイモ育種では,生殖質の多様化をはかる方法の一環として,近縁野生種の育種的利用を進めてきた. その成果として,線虫低抗性をもつ高でん粉多収性の系統・品種育成をみるにいたった. サツマイモは 6 倍体(2 n= 90) で,一方,その近縁野生種には 2 倍体, 4 倍体, 6 倍体がある. これら野生種およびサツマイモの倍数性に関与しているゲノムについてはいまだ十分解明されていない. 本報告では,野生種をもちいてできた 2 種類の合成 6 倍体,それらの両親,およびサツマイモとの交雑から生じたF_ 1 雑種について,減数分裂第 1 分裂中期の染色体対合を観察し,それら植物のゲノム構成を明らかにしようとした. 第 1 の合成 6 倍体はIpomoea lacunosa(K 61, 2 n= 30) とI. tiliacea(K 134, 2 例= 60) との 3 倍体雑種の染色体倍加によってえられた(Fig. 1). この 6 倍体では,低頻度の 1 価, 3 価, 4 価染色体がみられたが,平均 41. 3 の 2 価染色体がみられた. そして平均 43. 2 の 2 価染色体相当数があり,全体として異質または部分異質 6 倍体の染色体対合とみたすことができた(Table 1). 3 倍体雑種としてはI. trichocarpa(K 231, 2 n= 30) とK 134 との雑種が供試された。I. lacunssaとI. trichocarpaは共通のゲノムAをもつことが明らかにたっている・またJONES(1970) によれば, I. tiliaceaは異質 4 倍体としての染色体対合を示している. 以上のことから,I. tiliaceaのゲノム構成をA 1 A 1 TTとして,合成 6 倍体に暫定的たゲノム式AAA 1 A 1 TTを与えた. この合成 6 倍体は高い稔性をもつが,サツマイモとの交雑からは雑種を得ることはできたかった (K. A. E. S. 1963) ...|$|R
