The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} the {{research}} framework conducted by the Regional Center of Agricultural Research of Maroua. This investigation aimed at making an inventory of devastating and vectorial insects of the Rice Yellow Mottle Virus in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> of Maga (Far-North of Cameroon). In order to attain this objective, two collection methods were used. These included collection by D-VAC and collection by the Sweep net. The collection of the insect species with the two methods was done at the different phonological stages of the rice plant (nursery, heading, booting and maturity). The principle was to choose randomly a reference plot for each transplanted rice batch in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> of Maga. The insect identification key of Heinrich (10) and the family recognition key of Delvare et al. (5) were used to identify the different species collected. The insect inventory of rice in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> of Maga showed that the species vary in abundance and quality with the different phonological stages of the plant. Also the abundance of the species at the different stages varied following the collection methods. The results of the inventory showed that 46 species belonged to 26 families (Cicadellidae, Pentatomidae, Delphacidae, Diopsidae, Chloropidae Chrysomelidae, Coccinellidae, Acrididae, Pyralidae, Noctuidae…) and 7 orders (Lepidoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Thysanoptera and Hymenoptera). The same inventory with the D-VAC and the Sweep net showed that the insects associated with the rice in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> of the study area consisted of pest, of which some were vectors of Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (Nephottetis nigropictus, Oxya hyla, etc.) and natural ennemis of this pest...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of public <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> {{has been considered}} crucial in many countries. In many scientific papers the main problem raised {{is the process of}} transference of management from the public sector to the private users. Thus, the objective {{of this paper is to}} study CODEVASF’s sixteen public <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> in order to evaluate their emancipation process. Both bibliographic research and analysis of Brazilian legislation were done and a methodological proposal was elaborated which allows for evaluation of those perimeters in function of their peculiarities, especially management efficiency, operation and maintenance of their infrastructure, solvency of the producers, profitability of the agricultural activity and soil use. The indicators representative of these items were statistically treated with SPSS software to determine a model for identifying mathematically when a perimeter meets all the emancipation conditions. Results show that the proposed model is adequate and, although there were advances in CODEVASF’s <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> management transference process, there are still some difficulties related mainly to inspection and contractual instruments, which suggests the necessity of trying different forms of transference authorized by Brazilian legislation. <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters,</b> management transference, public policy, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Industrial Organization,...|$|R

During the late sixties and early seventies the Sahelian drought made the country painfully aware how dependent its agriculture is on rainfall. Irrigation and full water control systems along the major rivers became the "priority of priorities" in the recent Senegalese national plans. In the Senegal River Valley two major types of irrigation schemes had been implemented along the river valley since 1973 : large scale and small scale <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters.</b> The objectives are to increase rice production and reduce dependence on foreign imports of rice. This paper analyzed {{the two types of}} irrigation schemes in the Senegal River Valley and compares the financial and economic cost of producing rice in each of them with the average CIF price of rice delivered to the capital city Dakar. The analysis shows that for large <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> the economic and financial cost of locally produced rice delivered to Dakar range from 132 to 233 percent of the economic and financial average CIF price, respectively. For small perimeters the economic and financial costs are, respectively, 140 and 125 percent of the CIF prices. Costs for both large scale and small scale perimeters are relatively high for the following reasons: a) Senegal rice imports consist of broken milled rice from Southeast Asia which is the least expensive quality of rice on the world market; and b) Managerial problems which can be significantly improved if more consistent policies toward irrigated rice production are defined and applies, and if the land development agency concerned with the Senegal River Valley is reorganized.

However, it is noted that the water and soil of different irrigated areas are excessively exploited and threatened by different degradation problems. In this study, we aim to design an advanced methodology allowing to monitor soil and water quality in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> of Triffa. The study area is the most fertile and productive agricultural region of north-east Morocco. The surface area of the plain rises to 61 000 ha of which 36 060 ha are irrigated. The climate is warm semi-arid. The mean annual rainfall in 28 years is 331 mm. The mean annual temperature is 17. 2 ◦C. Recognized by the quality of its clementine, the Triffa plain experienced during the last decade a large and rapid expansion of irrigated areas mainly citrus through improved irrigation. Recent studies have shown that in this region, soil and water resources are under pressure due to salinization and groundwater nitrate pollution. The degradation of soil and water resources is largely caused by the increased use of agrochemicals, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, and the lack of control of irrigation and drainage of the plots. The protection and the preservation of these resources are top priority necessities, particularly in arid zones. We first aim to identify robust indicators of soil and groundwater degradation.

Os irrigantes indicaram pontos positivos do PerÃmetro Irrigado, com destaque para a oportunidade de terem um negÃcio prÃprio e a busca por uma melhor qualidade de vida, enquanto entre os pontos negativos do PerÃmetro, os mais apontados foram o acesso a serviÃos bÃsicos, a falta de organizaÃÃo dos produtores e a falta de assistÃncia tÃcnica. Conclui-se que os irrigantes do PerÃmetro Irrigado Baixo AcaraÃ, em geral, nÃo apresentaram, capacidade de pagamento no perÃodo estudado, enquanto, individualmente, a maior parte nÃo apresentou capacidade de pagamento. Apesar da qualidade da infraestrutra do PerÃmetro e de os irrigantes terem disposiÃÃo a pagar pela Ãgua que utilizam, ainda nÃo tÃm capacidade de pagamento pelo uso da Ãgua, {{dado que}} estÃo desorganizados e nÃo alcanÃam bons nÃveis de produÃÃo e de comercializaÃÃo. Por consequÃncia, o PerÃmetro nÃo mostra um nÃvel de sustentabilidade aceitÃvel. A desorganizaÃÃo dos irrigantes nÃo permite estabelecer estratÃgias que levem a um melhor desempenho dos irrigantes do PerÃmetro Irrigado Baixo AcaraÃThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the degree of sustainability of the <b>Irrigated</b> <b>Perimeter</b> Baixo AcaraÃ according to capacity to pay and willingness to pay of it irrigants. It was used secondary data and primary data from public institutions and the application of questionnaires and conduct of participative research. The methodology used for analysis of capacity to pay was through the removal of the socioeconomic characteristics of irrigant and the basic conceptual model called the "residual method". For analysis of the efficient allocation of production factors built up to the production function of Cobb-Douglas type. For analysis of the willingness to pay, questionnaires were applied. In relation to ability to pay, 21 irrigant (61. 76 %) proved to be without capacity to pay and three (8. 82 %) showed no willingness to pay. The production function showed a determination coefficient of 71 %, showing that 71 % of the variation in production can be explained by the variables included in the model. Despite the assumptions of the classical model have been tested and all have been met, the t statistic of the estimated coefficients were not significant, except for the inputs. The polynomial function having water as the only variable factor indicated that the majority of producers are using water to produce a rational way. The irrigant showed positive points of the <b>Irrigated</b> <b>Perimeter,</b> with emphasis on the opportunity to have their own business and search for a better quality of life, while among the negative points of the perimeter, the most mentioned were access to basic services, lack of organization producers and the lack of technical assistance. It is concluded that irrigants of the <b>Irrigated</b> <b>Perimeter</b> Baixo AcaraÃ do not generally presented, capacity to pay during the period studied, while individually, most showed no capacity to pay. Despite the of perimeter infrastructure quality and the fact of irrigants to have willingness to pay for water they use, they donât have capacity to pay for water use, as they are disorganized and do not reach good levels of production and marketing. Consequently, the perimeter does not show an acceptable level of sustainability. The disorganization of irrigants does not permit to establish strategies that lead to better performance of irrigants in the <b>Irrigated</b> <b>Perimeter</b> Baixo Acara...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the biochemical mechanisms associated with isolated and/or concurrent actions of drought and soil salinity in seedlings of coconut tree, through the accumulation of organic solutes (soluble carbohydrates, soluble amino N and free proline) in leaves and roots. The experiment, conducted in a protected environment, in Fortaleza, Brazil, in a randomized block design, in a split-plot arrangement, evaluated the effects of different levels of water stress (plots) by imposing distinct percentages of replacement of water losses through crop potential evapotranspiration - ETpc (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %), associated with subplots consisting of increasing levels of soil salinity in saturation extract (1. 72, 6. 25, 25. 80 and 40. 70 dS m- 1) provided by the soils collected in the <b>Irrigated</b> <b>Perimeter</b> of Morada Nova. Salinity did not change the concentration of organic solutes; however, there were increases in leaf and root levels of free proline in response to water stress, which contributes to the osmoregulation and/or osmoprotection of the species under adverse conditions of water supply...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} communities of practice (CoPs) of farmers play in the innovation process. The Agricultural Innovation Systems approach focuses mainly on interactions and learning between farmers and other actors but less on collective processes occurring between farmers. In CoPs farmers not only collectively construct knowledge, but also produce and reproduce discourses and norms providing framework for individual actions, that both can hamper or support innovation. We combined different qualitative methods to explore the role of CoPs of dairy farmers in three on-going innovation projects in an <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeter</b> in North-West Tunisia. We found farmers belonging to CoPs more empowered for innovation that those working individually with expert support. However, this was only true in the CoPs where access to external sources of knowledge was assured. Addressing farmers as collectively constructing knowledge and opening space for negotiation of meanings were conditions determining the success {{of one of the}} innovation projects. CoP's ability to collectively produce discourse should be used and farmers should be supported in developing innovation narratives. This implies sharing power with farmers over the innovation process. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Northeast of Brazil is a {{semi-arid}} region, {{where water}} is a key strategic resource {{in the development of}} all sectors of the economy. Irrigation agriculture is the main water consumer in this region. Therefore, policy directives are calling for tools to aid operational monitoring in planning, control and charging of irrigation water. Using Landsat imagery, this study evaluates the utility of a process that measures the level of water use in an irrigated area of the state of Ceará. The experiment, which models evapotranspiration (ET), was carried out within the Jaguaribe-Apodi irrigation scheme (DIJA) during two months of the agricultural season. The ET was estimated with the model Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC). The model uses the residual of the energy balance equation to estimate ET for each pixel in the image. The results of the estimates were validated using measurements of ET from a micrometeorological tower installed within a banana plantation located near the irrigation scheme. After evaluating the ET estimates, the average fraction of depleted water for a set of agricultural parcels combined with the monthly ET mapping estimates by METRIC provided a method for predicting the total water use in DIJA for the study period. The results were then compared against the monthly accumulated flow rates for all the pumping stations provided by the district manager. Finally, this work discusses the potential use of the model as an alternative method to calculate water consumption in irrigated agriculture and the implications for water resource management in <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters.</b> Water resource management Irrigation water charge METRIC model SEBAL model Evapotranspiration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{plain of}} the lower Cheliff is located 220 km {{to the west of}} Algiers and extends over 60000 ha. This plain which is only 40 km far from the Mediterranean has an arid climate and has {{suffered}} from dangerous degradation problems of its physical environment. This degradation is essentially due to the soil salinization which is manifested in different ground surfaces in relation with the degradation levels. The aim of this work is to use remote-sensing to evaluate the levels of soil degradation by the identification and the mapping of the ground surface. The visual analysis of the Aster image (August 2005) allows us to extract the big agronomic landscape units. And this led us to identify four homogeneous areas representing the different ground surfaces of the plain. The two <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> of Ouarizane and Djediouia, the non saline soils of Benziane valley, and the Gaa which contain uncultivated saline soils with halophytic vegetation. The supervised classification of the satellite image allows us to generalize this good discrimination capacity to the whole ground surface and to obtain 9 homogeneous classes corresponding to various degradation levels. Therefore it is evaluated by soil and vegetal cover indicators. The remote-sensing data with salinity measured data of the ground surface classes has been used to map the soil salinity using remote-sensing and apply a comparison with the map obtained by ordinary kriging. The two methods have shown an important extension of the salinity. However, the estimated salinity map by remote-sensing made it possible to better estimate in comparison to the one obtained by ordinary kriging, on the level of extremes values...|$|R

No Brasil, a polÃtica dos recursos hÃdricos ganhou grande importÃncia apÃs a ConstituiÃÃo Federal de 1988, somente em 1997 Ã que comeÃou a vigorar as Leis que impÃe a regulamentaÃÃo para o uso da Ãgua. O estado do CearÃ foi um dos pioneiros na adoÃÃo da polÃtica dos recursos hÃdricos, utilizando a negociaÃÃo democrÃtica como forma privilegiada de superar conflitos de uso, adotando a bacia hidrogrÃfica, como unidade bÃsica dos recursos hÃdricos. Observa-se no desenvolvimento deste trabalho que a cobranÃa da Ãgua bruta nÃo pode ser feita de forma uniforme, pois, Ã de {{fundamental}} importÃncia considerarem-se as diferenÃas entre os vÃrios perÃmetros irrigados e tipos de culturas ao se estabelecerem critÃrios de cobranÃa pelo uso de Ãgua bruta nesta Bacia.

In Brasil, hydric resources policy increased in importance after the 1988 Federal Constitution, but its lows regulating the use of water were reinforced only in 1997. The state of CearÃ was pionner in adopting a water resource policy, by means of democratic negociations to overcome conflicts of water usage, taking the hidrografic bay as a unit for water resource. It was observed in this work that charging the use of non-treated water can not be done in a uniform way, since it is extremely important to consider the diferences among the many <b>irrigated</b> <b>perimeters</b> and culture type for the settle rules of charge for the use of non-treated water in this bay...|$|R
