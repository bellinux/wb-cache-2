5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> for introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field.

5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} and riboswitches {{are thought}} to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly-related organisms.

RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could hint at a previously more widespread importance in an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|Relief efforts began almost immediately, and {{hospitals}} quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving from across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, but were impeded by a blizzard.

The International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior has named Mount Merapi as a Decade Volcano since 1995 because of its high volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, {{and there has been}} debate whether he might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>responsible</b> for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale.|$|E
