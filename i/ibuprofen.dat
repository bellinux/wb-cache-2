5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs, such as <b>ibuprofen,</b> may delay {{the healing of}} skin wounds. Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed {{following}} usual treatment.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: <b>ibuprofen</b> (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when <b>ibuprofen</b> became available without prescription.|$|E
5|$|Prevention is by washing {{hands and}} not sharing eating utensils. There is no vaccine for the disease. Treatment with {{antibiotics}} is only recommended {{in those with}} a confirmed diagnosis. Those infected should stay away from other people for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as <b>ibuprofen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to <b>ibuprofen</b> for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and <b>ibuprofen</b> in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of {{its wide}} availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to <b>ibuprofen</b> and aspirin) {{there is a}} much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as <b>ibuprofen</b> {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to the affected area, and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly <b>ibuprofen.</b> Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold. The primary methods of {{prevention}} are hand washing; not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands; and staying away from other sick people. Some evidence supports the use of face masks. No cure {{for the common}} cold exists, but the symptoms can be treated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as <b>ibuprofen</b> may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E
5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as <b>ibuprofen</b> should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. <b>Ibuprofen</b> can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for <b>ibuprofen.</b>|$|E
5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as <b>ibuprofen,</b> may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to <b>ibuprofen</b> or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as <b>ibuprofen,</b> that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
25|$|Advil (<b>ibuprofen)</b> {{for pain}} and fever.|$|E
25|$|Using both {{paracetamol}} and <b>ibuprofen</b> at {{the same}} time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or <b>ibuprofen.</b> It is not clear if it increases child comfort. Response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ibuprofen</b> (Advil)* {{can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} irritation, stomach ulcers, and kidney damage in dogs.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrochemical}} carboxylation of a para-isobutylbenzyl chloride to <b>Ibuprofen</b> {{is promoted}} under supercritical carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Nurofen Cold & Flu (made by Reckitt Benckiser) — {{contains}} 30mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 200mg <b>ibuprofen).</b>|$|E
25|$|Poisoning {{with pain}} {{medications}} is common. Aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol), <b>ibuprofen</b> (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, acetaminophen can cause liver disease, <b>ibuprofen</b> can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment {{depends on the}} clinical signs.|$|E
25|$|Type V: Can occur {{throughout}} the stomach. Associated with the chronic use of NSAIDs (such as <b>ibuprofen).</b>|$|E
25|$|In arm {{fractures}} in children, <b>ibuprofen</b> {{has been found}} to be as effective as a combination of acetaminophen and codeine.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the team}} who {{developed}} <b>ibuprofen</b> in the 1960s, Stewart Adams initially tested it on a hangover.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{doses of}} <b>ibuprofen</b> can extend the {{lifespan}} of yeast, worms and flies by 15 percent, it is reported.|$|E
25|$|Using antidepressants, acetaminophen, <b>ibuprofen,</b> or {{alcoholic}} beverages {{is thought to}} potentially suppress dreams, whereas melatonin may {{have the ability to}} encourage them.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} true in the past, newer {{versions}} of the EMIT bioassay are much less sensitive to <b>ibuprofen</b> (Advil, Motrin, etc.), and this has become relatively uncommon as of 1998, {{at least in the}} United States. However, abnormally high doses of <b>ibuprofen</b> can still potentially cause a false positive in not only THC but other drugs such as barbiturates. Nonetheless, this no longer works as an alibi for THC since GC/MS can now distinguish between the two.|$|E
25|$|For {{use against}} pain, {{dihydrocodeine}} is usually formulated as tablets or capsules containing 15–16mg or 30–32mg {{with or without}} other active ingredients such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), <b>ibuprofen,</b> or others.|$|E
25|$|Two {{studies in}} 2012 showed that <b>Ibuprofen</b> 600 milligrams three times daily was {{effective}} at decreasing the severity and incidence of AMS; {{it was not}} clear if HAPE or HACE was affected.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evaluation}} {{from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{concluded that the}} overall benefit/risk profile of nimesulide is favourable and in line {{with that of the}} other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, <b>ibuprofen,</b> and naproxen.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase {{because they have no}} DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. <b>Ibuprofen,</b> another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking <b>ibuprofen</b> before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Cochrane {{investigation}} {{found that the}} use of antibiotics either just before or just after surgery reduced the risk of infection, pain and dry socket after wisdom teeth are removed by oral surgeons, but that using antibiotics also causes more side effects for these patients. Twelve patients needed to receive antibiotics to prevent 1 infection and for every 21 people who received antibiotics, an adverse event was likely. The conclusion of the review was that antibiotics given to healthy people to prevent infections may cause more harm than benefit to both the individual patients and the population as a whole. Another Cochrane Investigation has found post-operative pain is effectively managed with either <b>ibuprofen,</b> or <b>ibuprofen</b> in combination with acetaminophen.|$|E
25|$|The salts {{pseudoephedrine}} hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine sulfate {{are found}} in many over-the-counter preparations, either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with antihistamines, guaifenesin, dextromethorphan, and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen) or an NSAID (such as aspirin or <b>ibuprofen).</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} EBV. Prevention is by not sharing {{personal}} items with or kissing those infected. Mono generally gets better on its own. Recommendations include drinking enough fluids, getting sufficient rest, and taking pain medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and <b>ibuprofen.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{patient may}} be asked to skip aspirin and aspirin-like {{products}} such as salicylate, <b>ibuprofen,</b> and similar medications for up to ten days before the procedure to avoid the risk of bleeding if a polypectomy is performed during the procedure. A blood test may be performed before the procedure.|$|E
25|$|NSAIDs, such as <b>ibuprofen,</b> {{can be used}} to {{help with}} the pain. Topical {{lidocaine}} may also help. Strep throat is typically treated with antibiotics, such as either penicillin or amoxicillin. It is unclear if steroids are useful in acute pharyngitis, other than possibly in severe cases.|$|E
