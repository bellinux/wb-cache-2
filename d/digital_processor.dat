50|$|At several stages, {{attaining}} the frequently over-optimistic {{expectations for}} digital computation equipment proved to take {{far longer than}} anticipated. For example, the SEASAT system was ready to orbit before its <b>digital</b> <b>processor</b> became available, so a quickly assembled optical recording and processing scheme had {{to be used to}} obtain timely confirmation of system operation. In 1978, the first digital SAR processor was developed by the Canadian aerospace company MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA). When its <b>digital</b> <b>processor</b> was finally completed and used, the digital equipment of that time took many hours to create one swath of image from each run of a few seconds of data. Still, while that was a step down in speed, it was a step up in image quality. Modern methods now provide both high speed and high quality.|$|E

50|$|For a <b>digital</b> <b>processor</b> {{implemented}} in hardware, binary compatibility means that (a large subset of) machine code produced for another processor can be correctly executed and has (much) {{the same effect}} as on the other processor. This is quite common among many processor families, although it is rather uncommon among the ubiquitous small embedded systems built around such processors. Full machine code compatibility would here imply exactly the same layout of interrupt service routines, I/O-ports, hardware registers, counter/timers, external interfaces and so on. For a more complex embedded system using more abstraction layers (sometimes on the border to a general computer, such as a mobile phone), this may be different.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a complete {{design and implementation}} of a low cost digital controller for a High Power LED driver.

Nowadays, the cost of <b>digital</b> <b>processors</b> is continuously decreasing, and the trend is that still lower costs will be achieved in the future. In addition, <b>digital</b> <b>processors</b> offer extra features, e. g. communication protocols, software protections, and so on. Therefore, this study has an increasing practical interest. Design guidelines for a LED based light supply with digital control are proposed. A prototype has been built and tested, and results are shown to validate the design approach. I...|$|R
50|$|CNN {{processors}} {{have been}} implemented and are currently available as semiconductors and there are plans to migrate CNN processors to emerging technologies in the future. Semiconductor-based CNN processors can be segmented into analog CNN <b>processors,</b> <b>digital</b> CNN <b>processors,</b> and CNN <b>processors</b> emulated using <b>digital</b> <b>processors.</b> Analog CNN processors {{were the first to}} be developed. Analog computers were fairly common during the 1950 and 1960s, but they gradually were replaced by digital computers the 1970s. Analog processors were considerably faster in certain applications such as optimizing differential equations and modeling nonlinearities, but the reason why analog computing lost favor was the lack of precision and the difficulty to configure an analog computer to solve a complex equation. Analog CNN processors share some of the same advantages as their predecessors, specifically speed. The first analog CNN processors were able to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (>10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by <b>digital</b> <b>processors.</b> The analog implementation of CNN processors requires less area and consumes less power than their digital counterparts. Although the accuracy of analog CNN processors does not compare to their digital counterparts, for many applications, noise and process variances are small enough not to perceptually affect the image quality.|$|R
