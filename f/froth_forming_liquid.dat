The model describes the temperature dependence of the viscosity of many kinds of glass <b>forming</b> <b>liquids</b> in terms of the mean values of the bond strength, coordination number and their fluctuations of the structural units that form the melt. According to the model, the cooperativity increases with the increase of fragility.
