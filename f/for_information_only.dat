50|$|Reid vapor {{pressure}} (RVP) {{is a common}} measure of the volatility of gasoline. It {{is defined as the}} absolute {{vapor pressure}} exerted by a liquid at 37.8 °C (100 °F) as determined by the test method ASTM-D-323. The test method measures the vapor pressure of gasoline, volatile crude oil, and other volatile petroleum products, except for liquefied petroleum gases. RVP is stated in kilopascals and represents a relative pressure to the atmospheric pressure because ASTM-D-323 measures the gauge pressure of the sample in a non-evacuated chamber. All values are in SI units and are regarded as standards. Imperial units are <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kyle {{abandons}} Barron to his fate, and the Master tracks {{him down}} and tortures him <b>for</b> <b>information,</b> <b>only</b> to learn that Barron believes Kyle and her associates {{are members of the}} Russian Mafia who are bringing their own people over to fill prominent positions in Britain. As this is obviously not true, the Master disposes of Barron, and reluctantly turns himself in to UNIT, knowing he will need their assistance. The Brigadier has serious reservations and is fully aware that the Master has an agenda of his own; nevertheless, he reluctantly accepts the Master's help and gives him access to the Doctor's laboratory. There, the Master sets about using the defunct time machines from the Dalek-invasion timeline to detect phase shifts and the operation of time machines in the vicinity. Boucher apparently returns, claiming to have found nothing at Faslane, but he soon slips up and is revealed to be an impostor. Realizing that he has been found out, Boucher takes Barbara as a hostage and flees from UNIT HQ, and to discourage pursuit he kills a homeless woman who resembles Barbara and makes it appear as though she burned to death in a car crash.|$|E
