40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} state-of-the art in {{vibration}} energy harvesting for wireless, self-powered microsystems. Vibration-powered generators are typically, although not exclusively, inertial spring and mass systems. The characteristic equations for inertial-based generators are presented, {{along with the}} specific damping equations {{that relate to the}} three main transduction mechanisms <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>energy</b> from the system. These transduction mechanisms are: piezoelectric, electromagnetic and electrostatic. Piezoelectric generators employ active materials that generate a charge when mechanically stressed. A comprehensive review of existing piezoelectric generators is presented, including impact coupled, resonant and human-based devices. Electromagnetic generators employ electromagnetic induction arising from the relative motion between a magnetic flux gradient and a conductor. Electromagnetic generators presented in the literature are reviewed including large scale discrete devices and wafer-scale integrated versions. Electrostatic generators utilize the relative movement between electrically isolated charged capacitor plates to generate energy. The work done against the electrostatic force between the plates provides the harvested energy. Electrostatic-based generators are reviewed under the classifications of in-plane overlap varying, in-plane gap closing and out-of-plane gap closing; the Coulomb force parametric generator and electret-based generators are also covered. The coupling factor of each transduction mechanism is discussed and all the devices presented in the literature are summarized in tables classified by transduction type; conclusions are drawn as to the suitability of the various techniques...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the {{detailed study of}} utilization of ambient vibration energy present in a system by converting it into usable electrical energy. With the huge decrease in electrical energy consumption in portable electronic devices the concept of harvesting electrical energy from the renewable sources in the surroundings of the system arouses its great importance. These low power micro electromechanical systems that can scavenge electrical energy from their operating environment are very long lasting, less economical, need no maintenance, and most importantly can be operated in inaccessible sites. There are mainly three transduction mechanisms <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> electrical <b>energy</b> from the vibration energy present in the surrounding of the system namely:-  Electromagnetic  Piezoelectric  Electrostatic This paper is a study of electromagnetic transduction mechanism to harvest useful electrical energy from the ambient vibrations...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} charge {{transport}} and density of trap states (trap DOS) in ambipolar diketopyrrolopyrrole-benzothiadiazole copolymer thin-film transistors. This semiconductor possesses high electron and hole field-effect mobilities {{of up to}} 0. 6 cm 2 /V-s. Temperature and gate-bias dependent field-effect mobility measurements are <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the activation <b>energies</b> and trap DOS to understand its unique high mobility balanced ambipolar charge transport properties. The symmetry between the electron and hole transport characteristics, parameters and activation energies is remarkable.

40|$|Biomass {{is one of}} the {{renewable}} and {{non-conventional energy}} sources and it includes municipal solid wastes and animal wastes in addition to agricultural residue. Concentrated animal feeding operations produce large quantities of cattle biomass which might result in land and water pollution if left untreated. Different methods are <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the available <b>energy</b> from the cattle biomass (CB) which includes co-firing and gasification. There are two types of CB: Feedlot biomass (FB), animal waste from feedlots and dairy biomass (DB), animal waste from dairy farms. Experiments were performed in the part on gasification of both FB and DB. Earlier studies on gasification of DB with different steam-fuel ratios resulted in increased production of hydrogen. In the present study, dairy biomass was gasified in a medium with enriched oxygen percentage varying from 24 % to 28 %. The effect of enriched air mixture, equivalence ratio and steam-fuel ratio on the performance of gasifier was studied. Limited studies were done using a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen as the gasification medium and also a methodology was developed to determine the gasification efficiency based on mass and heat contents of gas. The results show that the peak temperature within the bed increases with increase in oxygen concentration in the gasification medium. Also carbon dioxide concentration in the mixture increases with corresponding decrease in carbon monoxide with increase in oxygen concentration of the incoming gasification medium. The peak temperature increased from 988 ?C to 1192 ?C as the oxygen concentration increased from 21 % to 28 % at ER= 2. 1. The upper limit on oxygen concentration is limited to 28 % due to high peak temperature and resulting ash agglomeration. Higher heating value (HHV) of the gases decreases with increase in equivalence ratio. The gases produced using carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture had a higher HHV when compared to that of air and enriched air gasification. Typically the HHV of the gases increased from 2219 kJ/m? to 3479 kJ/m? when carbon dioxide and oxygen mixture is used for gasification instead of air at ER= 4. 2 in the absence of steam...|$|R
