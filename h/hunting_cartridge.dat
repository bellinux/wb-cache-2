2500|$|As a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge,</b> the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum has a {{very limited}} role. While {{it is capable of}} taking any species of game animal, it is too {{powerful}} for most game species. As a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge,</b> due to its power, energy and penetration, the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum {{has a very}} limited sporting niche. The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum is primarily a thick skinned dangerous game cartridge. It is designed to provide the ultimate in stopping power against African elephant, African buffalo, hippopotamus and [...] the rhinoceros. The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum when loaded to its full potential has little use outside its primary design purpose. Although the cartridge can be used to hunt any species of game, there are far better cartridge choices which offer a greater flexibility of use when hunting big game animals.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum {{cartridge}} {{was conceived}} as a long range <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> and in this it excels most other cartridges. It is able to launch bullets of good weights and sectional densities at high velocities and remaining energy to take game cleanly at longer ranges than lesser cartridges such as the [...]30-06 Springfield and even the [...]300 Winchester Magnum.|$|E
2500|$|A {{commercial}} sporting {{version of}} the M1895 Lee Straight Pull was sold by Winchester. It did not sell well in U.S. markets due to a heavy preference by American consumers for lever-action rifle designs. [...] The cartridge was chambered {{for a time in}} the Remington-Lee and Blake magazine rifles. [...] With a reputation for penetration and explosive effect, the 6mm Lee was reportedly quite popular as a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> in Alaska and Northwest Canada. [...] It was discontinued from commercial production in 1935. [...] The 6mm Lee cartridge case later served {{as the basis for the}} [...]220 Swift, which used a necked-down 6mm Lee case with a [...]22-caliber bullet.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]308 Winchester {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> in the United States, and {{possibly}} the world. It has gained popularity in many countries as an exceptional cartridge for game in the medium- to large-sized class. In North America it is used extensively on whitetail deer, pronghorn and even the occasional caribou or black bear.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{such as the}} [...]25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the [...]270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the [...]284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) {{are used}} when high BCs and {{moderate}} recoil are desired. The [...]30-06 Springfield and [...]308 Winchester cartridges also offer several high-BC loads, although the bullet weights are on the heavy side.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Father of High Velocity" [...] was {{of course}} firearm {{designer}} and cartridge pioneer Charles Newton, being the first to build a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> and rifle capable of firing a bullet at over 3000 fps. It was with Weatherby that the trend of ultra high velocity hunting calibers was developed. In the late 80's, Remington's Ultra Mag series of unbelted cartridges, returning to the Charles Newton style of cartridge design, has given Weatherby competition. However, Weatherby still holds the title of most powerful commercially available <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{in the world with}} its [...]460 Weatherby.|$|E

5000|$|... 300 Winchester Magnum: One of {{the most}} popular big game <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> of all time. Also, as a {{long-range}} sniping round, it is favored by US Navy SEALs and the German Bundeswehr. While not in the same class as the 338 Lapua, it has roughly the same power as 7 mm Remington Magnum, and easily exceeds the performance of 7.62×51mm NATO.|$|R
5000|$|In 1934, Remington {{decided to}} make the new [...]25 Roberts {{cartridge}} available commercially. Remington eliminated case-trimming and modified the shoulder angle from the original 15° to 20° for greater ease in manufacturing. The resulting cartridge had a 1/16" [...] longer case, and was given the slightly different designation of [...]257 Roberts. The new Remington cartridge went on to become, for decades, {{one of the most popular}} North American <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Like other 'dangerous game' cartridges, {{ammunition}} {{is expensive}} compared with standard <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges,</b> often costing up to 10 times more per shell than typical cartridges {{such as the}} [...]30-06. Because of this many shooters choose to handload the [...]470 NE. Brass {{can be obtained from}} a variety of sources, and like most reloading components varies in quality. Lighter loads for practice can be created that are more enjoyable and cheaper to shoot.|$|R
5000|$|In 1872, Sharps {{introduced}} the [...]50-90 Sharps <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Hugo Borchardt designed the last rifle {{made by the}} company, the Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878, but the company went bankrupt and was defunct three years later in 1881.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]500 Linebaugh was {{designed}} as a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> but would also make excellent backup firearm in areas where large bears may be encountered; particularly in Alaska. It {{was designed}} to fire a 440 gr g bullet at 1300 ft/s. This particular loading generates [...] of energy making this {{one of the most powerful}} handgun cartridges put into production. In terms of energy, this is comparable to the [...]454 Casull cartridge. However, the [...]500 Linebaugh provides a larger diameter, heavier bullet with a greater sectional density than the [...]454 Casull. As a <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge</b> it is capable of taking any North American game animals and most African game species.|$|E
5000|$|Supersonic loads {{are capable}} of {{matching}} ballistics of the 7.62×39mm and coming close to the ballistics of the [...]30-30 Winchester (which shoots a heavier bullet at similar velocities), making the [...]300 Whisper a capable short range deer <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Taylor KO Factor is a formulaic {{mathematical}} {{approach for}} evaluating the stopping power of <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The term [...] "KO" [...] is an acronym for [...] "Knock Out."

5000|$|After the {{armistice}} most M1917 rifles {{were placed in}} storage, although Chemical Mortar units continued to be issued them. During the 1920s and 1930s many M1917 rifles were released for civilian use through the NRA, or were sold as surplus. Many were [...] "sporterized", sometimes including rechambering to more powerful magnum <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges,</b> such as [...]300 H&H Magnum and [...]300 Winchester Magnum. It was so popular as a sporting weapon that Remington manufactured about 30,000 new rifles as the Model 30 from 1921 to 1940.|$|R
5000|$|Based {{upon the}} [...]30 Remington cartridge, it is midway between the 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO in bore {{diameter}} and muzzle energy. It {{uses the same}} diameter bullet (not usually the same weight) as the venerable [...]270 Winchester <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 5.6×50mm Magnum and 5.6×50mmR Magnum {{cartridges}} {{were developed}} in Germany as legal hunting cartridges for small game, fox, chamois and roe deer at ranges up to and over 200 m. In North America it is considered a varmint <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 7.62×40mm Wilson Tactical (7.62×40mm WT) is a {{centerfire}} {{rifle cartridge}} introduced in 2011 by Wilson Combat.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to beating the ballistics {{of the old}} [...]44-40 rifle loads, long considered a top deer cartridge, the heavy, flat-point bullets typically used in the [...]44 Magnum have an additional advantage. Tests performed where bullets are shot through light cover, intended to represent twigs and brush, {{have shown that the}} high-velocity, lightweight, thin-jacketed, pointed bullets used by most <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> today are easily deflected by contact with the brush. The ideal bullets for penetrating brush with minimal deflection are heavy, flat-point bullets at moderate velocities.|$|R
50|$|The 6.5×68mm rebated rim bottlenecked {{centerfire}} {{rifle cartridge}} (also {{known as the}} 6.5×68mm RWS, 6.5×68mm Schüler, or the 6.5×68mm Von Hofe Express) and its sister cartridge the 8×68mm S were developed in the 1930s by August Schüler from the August Schüler Waffenfabrik, Suhl, Germany as magnum <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> that would just fit and function in standard-sized Mauser 98 bolt-action rifles. This {{is one of the}} early examples where a completely new rifle cartridge (the 6.5×68mm and 8×68mm S have no other cartridge as parent case) was developed by a gunsmith to fit a specific popular and widespread type of rifle.|$|R
50|$|The 7.92×57mm Mauser is {{a common}} {{chambering}} offering in rifles marketed for European and North American sportsmen, alongside broadly similar cartridges such as the 5.6×57mm, 6.5×55mm, 6.5×57mm, and the 6.5×68mm and 8×68mm S magnum <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Major European manufacturers like Zastava Arms, Blaser, Česká Zbrojovka firearms, Heym, Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH and Steyr Mannlicher produce factory new 7.92×57mm Mauser hunting rifles and European ammunition manufacturers like Blaser, RUAG Ammotec/RWS, Prvi Partizan, Sako and Sellier & Bellot produce factory new ammunition. In 2004 Remington Arms offered a limited-edition Model 700 Classic bolt action hunting rifle chambered for the 7.92×57mm Mauser.|$|R
5000|$|Since the [...]458 Winchester Magnum was {{intended}} as a dangerous game <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge,</b> almost all ammunition manufactured for the cartridge is manufactured for these game species. Bullets used to load the [...]458 Winchester Magnum by ammunition manufacturers generally range between 450 - 510 gr g.|$|E
5000|$|As {{almost all}} {{dangerous}} game hunting is conducted at short ranges with most shootings occurring well within {{a distance of}} 60 yd, the [...]458 was not designed as a long range <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Its effective hunting range against large dangerous game is considered less than 110 yd.|$|E
50|$|At a {{press conference}} on the {{occasion}} of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that the gas analyser had not been used.

5000|$|The {{cartridge}} is a de novo {{design and}} was constructed to outperform popular <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> like the [...]30-06 Springfield and 7.92×57mm Mauser. When {{compared with the}} [...]30-06 Springfield the [...]30 R Blaser features an equal maximum chamber pressure of 405 MPa (58,740 psi) piezo pressure - which is fairly high for a rimmed rifle cartridge - but more cartridge case capacity, allowing the use of more propellant. The [...]30 R Blaser performance does however not reach the power level of [...]30 caliber magnum cartridges like the [...]300 Winchester Magnum that feature more cartridge case capacity and higher maximum chamber pressure levels.|$|R
50|$|The 8×68mm S rebated rim bottlenecked {{centerfire}} {{rifle cartridge}} (the S denoting {{it is intended}} for 8.2 mm (.323 in) groove diameter bullets) and its necked-down sister cartridge, the 6.5×68mm (no S, or other modifier required), were developed in the 1930s by August Schüler of the August Schüler Waffenfabrik, Suhl, Germany as magnum <b>hunting</b> <b>cartridges</b> that would just fit and function in standard-sized Mauser 98 bolt-action rifles.
