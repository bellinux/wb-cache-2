5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Hesiod wrote his poems down, or dictated them, rather than passed them on orally, as rhapsodes did—otherwise the pronounced personality that now emerges from the poems would surely have been diluted through oral transmission from one rhapsode to another. Pausanias asserted that Boeotians showed him an old tablet made of lead on which the Works were engraved. If he did write or dictate, it was perhaps {{as an aid to}} memory or because he lacked confidence in his ability to produce poems extempore, as trained rhapsodes could do. It certainly wasn't in a quest for immortal fame since poets in his era had probably no such notions for themselves. However, some scholars suspect the presence of large-scale changes in the text and attribute this to oral transmission. Possibly he composed his verses during <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> on the farm, in the spring before the May harvest or the dead of winter.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, few {{researchers}} are paying {{focus on the}} effect of considering the <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> cost. Time management is extremely important in any business. This includes timing the completion of one project to coordinate with the beginning of another to reduce <b>idle</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Idle</b> <b>time</b> is the time associated with waiting, or when a piece of machinery is not being used but could be.

Also, too much of <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> means wastage of resources because machinery are idle and it is not in use.

She had no fear of that sordid impersonal goddess who rules Philistia; it mattered not to her what [...] "people said," [...] or whether or not they said anything about her. [...] "Aiunt: quid aiunt? aiant," [...] was her motto. Could she have known to a certainty that her meetings on the common with Alan Merrick had excited unfavorable comment among the old ladies of Holmwood, the point would have seemed to her unworthy of an emancipated soul's consideration. She could estimate at its true worth the value of all human criticism upon human action.|$|E

40|$|Channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> {{distribution}} based {{secondary transmission}} strategies {{have been studied}} intensively in the literature. Under various performance metrics, the ultimate performance of secondary devices are eventually dictated by the presumed channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> distribution. Such distributions can take any arbitrary form in practice. In this work, we study <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> distributions in wireless local area networks (WLAN) using large amount of the channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> data collected in real-world WLAN networks. We demonstrate with experimental data that the channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> distribution can be closely modeled by hyper-exponential distribution. Furthermore, one can treat the primary packet arrival process as a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Several secondary transmission strategies are discussed under this model. It is shown that using only one hyper-exponential distribution, the secondary user can achieve a desirable performance when the primary packet arrival process is stationary. However, experimental data suggests that in practice, this process is not stationary and the secondary user can experience a large performance loss with stationary transmission strategy. We propose a novel transmission strategy that achieves suboptimal secondary user performance when the <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> distribution is not stationary. The performances of secondary transmission strategies are demonstrated using experimental data...|$|R
50|$|A {{sequence}} step algorithm (SQS-AL) is an algorithm implemented in a discrete event simulation system to maximize resource utilization. This {{is achieved by}} running through two main nested loops: A {{sequence step}} loop and a replication loop. For each sequence step, each replication loop is a simulation run that collects crew idle time for activities in that sequence step. The collected crew <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> are then used to determine resource arrival dates for user-specified confidence levels. The process of collecting the crew <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> and determining crew arrival times for activities on a considered sequence step is repeated from the first to the last sequence step.|$|E
50|$|MACPASS was {{introduced}} in 1998 to speed up toll collection and provide a more convenient payment method for bridge users. The MACPASS was such a success that on July 25, 2006 the HDBC announced they were phasing out the use of tokens to reduce <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> at the toll plaza and ensure {{the capacity of the}} bridges was not lessened by toll plaza congestion. When the announcement was made, 55% of tolls were already being paid electronically with MACPASS. It is believed that if this number can be increased, greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced due to reduced <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> at the toll plaza, and help alleviate the immediate need for a third harbour crossing by ensuring the full capacity of the existing bridges is utilized.|$|E
50|$|Cycle {{stealing}} {{is difficult}} to achieve in modern systems due to many factors such as pipelining, where pre-fetch and concurrent elements are constantly accessing memory, leaving few predictable <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> to sneak in memory access.

30|$|The {{overhead}} of this {{random access}} protocol consists of channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> (duration {{of time when}} all nodes are waiting {{and no one is}} using the channel) and loss from packet collisions. There is a trade-off between average channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> and probability of packet collision. If the contention window is too small, chance of packet collision increases. If the contention window is too large, channel <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> increases. An optimal contention window size depends on factors such as number of contending stations and average packet size.|$|R
