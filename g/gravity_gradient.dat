25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient,</b> atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> torque. For the space station, the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E

This solution, while potentially effective, raises a number of operational, engineering, and physiological issues that {{will need to be}} addressed. The human physiological responses to long-duration exposure to anything other than zero-gravity or Earth's gravity are unknown.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{the aim of}} the GOCE {{mission to}} {{determine}} a model of the Earth’s gravity field with high accuracy and resolution. For this purpose, <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> will be measured in combination with high– low satellite-to-satellite tracking. The <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> are derived from pair-wise differenced accelerations as determined by the six three-axes accelerometers that form the GOCE gradiometer. Since the measured accelerations suffer from errors of a random and systematic nature, the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> may suffer from random and systematic errors as well. Systematic errors are, for example, a scale factor and a bias. The common accelerations of the paired accelerometers also are contaminated with such errors. The common accelera-tions are used in the drag-free control of the satellite an...|$|R
500|$|The {{attitude}} (orientation) of {{the station}} was independently determined {{by a set of}} externally mounted sun, star and horizon sensors. [...] Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors. Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or [...] "gyrodynes") rotating at 10,000rpm kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the Kvant-1 and Kvant-2 modules. When the attitude {{of the station}} needed to be changed, the gyrodynes were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the Sofora girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged. This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible. Conversely, materials processing experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station, and so Mir would be oriented in a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradient</b> attitude for stability. Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes, the station's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station's orientation.|$|E

40|$|The Gravity {{field and}} {{steady-state}} Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) is the European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite gravity mission {{to determine the}} Earth's mean gravity field. GOCE delivers <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> anew type of satellite data. We study how these data can improve modeling of the Earth's lithosphere. We discuss {{the use of the}} original GOCE <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> versus the use of <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> in grids at satellite altitude or close the Earth's surface and conclude that grids are easier to handle than the original data because one does not have to deal with very different error characteristics of the different gradients, given in a rotating frame at varying heights. The downward continuation to the surface enhances signaland better reflects the near-surface geology. But this does not outweigh the amplification of noise and omission errors, which is why we recommend using the field at mean satellite altitude for lithospheric modeling. The North-East Atlantic region is ideal to analyze the additional value of GOCE <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients</b> because it is a well-studied region in terms of regional geophysics. We calculated the gradient sensitivity for crustal depth slices using a 3 D lithospheric model. This reveals that especially interfaces with large density contrasts have a distinct signal in the <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> but that they are quite insensitive to intra-crustal density sources, which can have quite a large effect on surface gravity data. We also show thatthe satellite gradients have a depth sensitivity well suited to study the upper mantle density structure, making them complementary to gravity and seismic tomography. In the underexplored Rub'al-Khaliarea the GOCE vertical gradient was used to invert for crustal thickness. The updated Moho model givesa good fit to four of the six gradients and independent depths from seismic stations. The Moho modelwas used to update the heat flow model and source rock maturity maps, which are generally consistent with known source rock maturity trends in the surrounding regions. GOCE gradients are therefore usefulto map crustal thickness and deep regional structures for frontier areas. In combination with other data, heat flow can be modeled which is essential for basin maturity evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Long-time atom {{interferometry}} is instrumental to various high-precision measurements of fundamental physical properties, including {{tests of the}} equivalence principle. Due to rotations and <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> the classical trajectories characterizing {{the motion of the}} wave packets for the two branches of the interferometer do not close in phase space, an effect which increases significantly with the interferometer time. The relative displacement between the interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe pattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the oscillations of the integrated particle number {{as a function of the}} phase shift. Paying particular attention to <b>gravity</b> <b>gradients,</b> we present a simple mitigation strategy involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses which is very easy to implement. A useful representation-free description of the state evolution in an atom interferometer is introduced and employed to analyze the loss of contrast and mitigation strategy in the general case.

Furthermore, exact results are obtained for (pure and mixed) Gaussian states which allow a simple interpretation in terms of the alignment of Wigner functions in phase-space. Analytical results are also obtained for expanding Bose-Einstein condensates within the time-dependent Thomas-Fermi approximation.
