5000|$|A {{group of}} paranormal investigators, Neal, Henry, Jessica, Neal's girlfriend Amy, and Jessica's girlfriend Devon, {{have arrived at}} a house where Henry's wife and {{daughter}} were murdered by a serial killer known only as the Night Stalker. The team hopes to free the pair's souls via a device created by Neal, which can capture ghosts and seal them in containers. As the investigation proceeds Devon leaves and is killed by a <b>floating</b> <b>knife</b> while another Amy experiences a series of visions. These visions not only show her the deaths of Henry's wife and daughter, but also reveal that Henry is the Night Stalker. Henry had murdered {{them as part of}} a paranormal experiment, in the hopes that their extreme distress would amplify paranormal energy. Amy manages to get a recording of Henry confessing to the murders, an action ends with Henry shooting Neal with a gun he was carrying with him. Amy and Jessica flee, but are caught by Henry. They are almost shot, but are spared when the ghost of Henry's wife appears and distracts him long enough for Jessica to break the containers of ectoplasm. The now released ghosts attack Henry, giving Amy and Jessica a chance to escape - only for Jessica to get shot and die. The film ends with Amy, the sole survivor of the night's events, leaving the house as police arrive.|$|E

All of the coating described in these articles was applied by a knife over blanket technique. In the work described herein, other application techniques were used, including <b>floating</b> <b>knife,</b> re-verse roll, and transfer coating. Tearing strengths were measured, and pene-tration studied by the stereo technique described previously. High tearing strengths could be obtained {{by all of the}} coating techniques, but no simple relationship existed between tearing strength and degree of penetration. Certain of the techniques created a porosity in the penetrated coating which is believed to be responsible for the high tearing strengths obtained...|$|E
