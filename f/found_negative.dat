25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that religiosity {{can be a}} pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control. Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity {{has been found to}} mitigate the negative impact of injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction.|$|E

[...] Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome, stating, [...] "The old, the ugly or the unwanted is simply made to disappear through a manhole". He also criticized the show for presenting bland and unrealistic characters, and for failing to teach children about social relationships and how {{to become a part of}} the society around them. [...] Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw Sesame Street's urban setting as [...] "superficial" [...] and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child.|$|E

An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men.

500|$|The show's {{research}} {{staff and}} producers conducted regularly-scheduled internal reviews and seminars {{to ensure that}} their curriculum goals were being met and to guide future production. As of 2001, ten seminars had been conducted specifically to address the literacy needs of preschool children. Curriculum seminars prior to Sesame Street's 33rd season in 2002 resulted in a change from the show's magazine-like format to a more narrative format. There have been over 1,000 studies as of 2001 which examine the show's impact on children's learning and attention. Most of these studies were conducted by the CTW and remain unpublished. The most important studies that <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> effects of Sesame Street were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Both studies found that the show increased the educational gap between poor and middle-class children. Morrow reported that these studies had little impact on the public discussion about Sesame Street. Another criticism was made by journalist Kay Hymowitz in 1995, who reported that most of the positive research conducted on the show has been done by the CTW, and then sent to a sympathetic press. She charged that the studies conducted by the CTW [...] "hint at advocacy masquerading as social science".|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of phenotypic effects of genetic mutations on molecular evolution {{is not well}} understood. Neutral and nearly neutral theories of molecular evolution predict a negative relationship between the evolutionary rate of proteins and their functional importance; nevertheless empirical studies seeking relationships between evolutionary rate and the phenotypic role of proteins have not produced conclusive results. In particular, previous studies have not <b>found</b> the expected <b>negative</b> correlation between evolutionary rate and gene pleiotropy. Here, we studied the effect of gene pleiotropy and the phenotypic size of mutations on the evolutionary rate of genes in a geometrical model, in which gene pleiotropy was characterized by n molecular phenotypes that affect organismal fitness. For a nearly neutral process, we <b>found</b> a <b>negative</b> relationship between evolutionary rate and mutation size but pleiotropy {{did not affect the}} evolutionary rate.

50|$|The D1-D2 {{receptor}} is upregulated {{in individuals}} suffering from major depression, {{and especially the}} ratio D1-D2 to D1 receptor is markedly shifted towards the heteromer.

Disruption of the heteromer can be achieved either directly by ligands interacting with the cytoplasmic interface, less directly by ligands that target the extracellular binding site, or indirectly as a downstream effect of classical antidepressant treatment. One study <b>found</b> <b>negative</b> results regarding a shift from Gs/a coupling to Gq/11 signaling; so such dynamics could be mediated by cAMP-dependent cascades rather from phospholipase C regulation.|$|E
