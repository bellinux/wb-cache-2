5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{commenced}} on 10 May 1940. While initial {{air operations}} went well, and the German fighters and bombers soon gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce {{opposition in the}} Battle for The Hague and the Battle of Rotterdam. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{chasm between}} the official, {{communist}} culture and genuine culture. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> authorities intentions, the outstanding works {{were perceived as}} a realm of moral truths and the significant representatives of genuine cultural achievement were held in very high esteem by the public opinion. On the other hand, the slogans disseminated nationwide through the forms of official culture helped spread simplistic views, which were relatively successful among some ranks of the population. The tension between these two directions can still be perceived {{at the level of}} society as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The drum {{is usually}} {{played in a}} seated position, held {{vertically}} on the player's thigh and supported {{by his or her}} upper body and arm (usually on the left side, for a right-handed player), with the hand placed {{on the inside of the}} skin where it is able to control the tension (and therefore the pitch and timbre) by applying varying amounts of pressure and also the amount of surface area being played, with the back of the <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> crossbar, if present. The drum is struck with the other arm (usually the right) and is played either with the bare hand or with a tipper. There are numerous playing styles, mostly named after the region of Ireland in which they originated. The most common is Kerry style, which uses a two-headed tipper; the West Limerick style uses only one end of the tipper.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E

This section is in [...] time (three {{crochets}} to a bar) and is marked [...] "Andante con moto" [...] ("at a walking pace, with movement"). The fugue, which is mainly in four-part writing with frequent rhythmic changes, gradually builds to a climax. In bar 69, a new louder melody is added in the right <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fugue theme in the pedals. Gradually, the piece dies away to two parts and ppp (pianississimo, [...] "very, very quietly") as the left and right hands play the fugue theme a bar apart from each other, in canon. The whole piece lasts about five minutes.|$|E

500|$|Suter's tenure {{with the}} Whalers lasted only one day, as Hartford {{immediately}} dealt {{him to the}} Chicago Blackhawks along with Randy Cunneyworth and a draft pick for Frantisek Kucera and Jocelyn Lemieux. Suter appeared in 16 regular season games with the Blackhawks, finishing the season with 41 games played and 18 points combined between Calgary and Chicago. He quickly established a place alongside Chris Chelios as the team's top defensive pair. [...] In his first full season in Chicago, Suter was looked upon {{to serve as a}} team leader and played a key role with the team's power play. He appeared in all 48 games of the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, scoring 37 points, but missed several playoff games after suffering a broken <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Vancouver Canucks.|$|E
500|$|Between 4:00pm and 5:00am the {{following}} day, the Polish 10th Armored Division, Polish 19th Armored Division, Polish 4th Infantry Division and Polish 5th Infantry Division, totaling about 10,300troops and the Internal Security Corps {{under the command}} of Poplavsky entered Poznań. A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators. At 7:30am on June29 the Prime Minister arrived and infamously declared on the local radio station that [...] "any provocateur or lunatic who raises his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> people's government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Although in the {{previous}} years the Venetians had generally held the upper <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans, largely controlling the Aegean and able to extract tribute and recruits from its islands, they {{had been unable to}} transform this superiority into concrete results. Despite their defeats, the Ottomans were still free to roam the Aegean and resupply their forces in Crete, in particular through the use of supply fleets from places like Alexandria, Rhodes, Chios or Monemvasia in the Peloponnese. In June 1656 however, a combined Venetian–Maltese fleet of 67 ships under Marcello inflicted on the Ottomans, with 108 ships under Kenan Pasha, their [...] "worst naval defeat since Lepanto": Sixty Ottoman ships were destroyed and 24 captured and 5,000 Christian galley slaves set free, although the Venetians and Maltese suffered some casualties too, including the loss of Captain General Marcello. Although in the aftermath of this victory the Maltese contingent departed, the scale of their success enabled the Venetians under Barbado Doer to seize Tenedos on 8 July and Lemnos on 20 August. Using the two islands, strategically located near the entrance of the Straits, as forward bases, the Venetian blockade became much more effective. As a result, the resupply of Crete was effectively cut off, and Constantinople itself suffered a shortage of food during the following winter.|$|E

500|$|Beginning on 28 June 1956, {{workers in}} the {{industrial}} city of Poznań, who had repeatedly, but in vain petitioned the authorities to intervene and improve their deteriorating situation, went on strike and rioted {{in response to a}} cut in wages and changed working conditions. Demonstrations by factory workers turned into a huge citywide protest. 16 tanks, 2 armoured personnel carriers and 30 vehicles were brought to bear by a local military commander. Some of them were seized by the protesters, who also broke into the local government buildings. 57 people were killed and several hundred injured in two days of fighting. Several major military formations entered the scene, but the army's role was mainly that of support of the police and the security forces action. At the Poznań radio station, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz in his widely publicized speech warned and threatened the rioters: he [...] "…who will dare raise his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> people's rule may be sure that… the authorities will chop off his hand". Of the 746 people officially detained during and {{in the aftermath of the}} disturbances, almost 80% were workers. The authorities launched an investigation, attempting to uncover a claimed premeditated instigation and involvement by Western or anticommunist underground centers. Such efforts were unsuccessful and the events were found to have been spontaneous and locally supported. The Poznań revolt's lasting impact was that it caused a deeper and more liberal realignment within the Polish communist party and its relationship to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|By June 1813 Belgrano {{set up a}} base in Potosí with an army of 2,500 men, {{to prepare}} an attack on Upper Peru. Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned, being {{replaced}} by Joaquín de la Pezuela. Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli. Belgrano initiated {{good relations with the}} natives as well. Belgrano's plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides, with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya. Both armies were near 3,500 men. However, the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers, which gave them insight into the patriotic plans. Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October, and initially gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> royalist troops, who started to flee. However, when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following, he reorganised his forces, returned to the battle, and won. There were barely 400 survivors. Belgrano said: [...] "Soldiers: we have lost the battle after so much fighting. Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph. It does not matter! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands!". After gathering his army at Macha, where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba, Belgrano was ready for another engagement with Pezuela, whose troops were not in a better situation. On 14 November, Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma, and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy.|$|E

And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field. And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces. And he said to Jeroboam: 'Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee—but he shall have one tribe, for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel—because that they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, to do that which is right in Mine eyes, and to keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, as did David his father." ...|$|E
