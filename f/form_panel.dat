40|$|I analyze {{remittance}} {{behavior among}} new legal {{immigrants in the}} US using the 2003 New Immigrant Survey (NIS), a nationally representative survey of immigrants admitted to legal permanent residency in 2003. I use the NIS to address data limitations common to empirical remittance studies, such as low sample sizes, missing information on the donor or recipient {{and the absence of}} data which includes immigrants from many countries. Looking first at the distribution of remittances, I find that it is skewed to the right, with a small number of immigrants sending very large amounts. I then analyze the determinants of remittances among new immigrants and estimate remittance-income elasticities. From this analysis, I find evidence that the motivations to remit are not purely altruistic and may include the desire to invest in the home country. I then discuss how future work will re-examine this investment motivation and its relationship to return migration by incorporating later waves of the 2003 NIS to <b>form</b> <b>panel</b> data. Finally, I find that large country differentials in remittance behavior are only partially explained by observable characteristics of the donor, recipient and origin country...|$|E

40|$|As {{economic}} {{time series}} or cross sectional data are typically affected by serial correlation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown <b>form,</b> <b>panel</b> data typically contains {{some form of}} heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and/or spatial correlation. Therefore, robust inference {{in the presence of}} heteroskedasticity and spatial dependence is an important problem in spatial data analysis. In this paper we study the standard errors based on the HAC of cross-section averages that follows Vogelsang’s (2012) fixed-b asymptotic theory, i. e. we continue with Driscoll and Kraay approach (1998). The Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the finite sample properties of commonly used estimators both not accounting and accounting for heteroskedasticity and spatiotemporal dependence (OLS, GLS) in comparison to brand new estimator based on Vogelsang’s (2012) fixed-b asymptotic theory in the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity and serial and spatial correlation in panel data with fixed effects. Our Monte Carlo experiment shows that the OLS exhibits an important downward bias in all of the cases and almost always has the worst performance when compared to the other estimators. The GLS corrected for HACSC performs well if time dimension is greater than cross-sectional dimension. The best performance {{can be attributed to the}} Vogelsang’s estimator with fixed-b version of Driscoll-Kraay standard errors...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role of operational customer relationship management (OCRM) on customer loyalty with special reference to the mobile telephone industry in Zimbabwe. Motivation for the research was generated by the need to find out how customer loyalty can be created through OCRM. The research was conducted by reviewing various streams of literature and interviews with 7 representatives from the 3 dominant companies in the industry and 15 sampled customers from these three competing companies in the mobile telephone industry (MTI). A semi-structured questionnaire was used. All qualitative responses were grouped into themes for coding purposes. The data gathered was coded and captured to <b>form</b> <b>panel</b> data for further analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 0. Results of the research showed that because of the highly dynamic market environment, consumers have become highly demanding calling for the strategic significance of the intelligent network in OCRM for the creation of customer satisfaction. The research also revealed that increasing organizational performance through operational CRM implementation can increase customer perceived value which results in customer loyalty and competitiveness. Our current research focused on operational CRM’s influence on customer loyalty. Future research should assess the impact of analytical CRM on customer loyalty. The measurement and critical analysis of customer life time value against company investments in building loyalty should redirect future research towards thi...|$|E
40|$|A central {{finding in}} earlier {{research}} is that attitudes to work generally are more positive among older workers than among younger workers. This {{result has been}} interpreted in two different ways, by the cultural and the structural hypotheses. The cultural hypothesis sees age differences as outcomes of generational differences. We would expect that different cohorts should hold different work attitudes and that the work values of an age group at an earlier point in time should {{be different from the}} work values of the same age group at a later point in time. The structural hypothesis sees age differences as expressions of labour market inequality between older and younger workers. This point of view leads us to expect that age differences in work attitudes will follow changes in the job structure and in working conditions. Drawing on data from the Swedish survey of living conditions (ULF), attitude change within the Swedish work force during the period 1979 – 2003 was examined. Three sub-periods, 1986 / 1987, 1994 through 1996 and 2001 through 2003 were compared to 1979, the year of reference. The main results showed that a consistently lower share of the work force held extrinsic work values in the subsequent periods and this applied to all age groups. The results did not support the assumption that broader cultural differences between generations are central explanations of differences in work values. Older workers held extrinsic work values to a lesser degree than younger workers regardless of period. Most strikingly the gap between the youngest group on the labour market (aged 16 – 29) and the older ones widened during the period. Furthermore, class differences in the distribution of the extrinsic attitude were intact throughout the study period; manual employees were consistently more likely to hold an extrinsic attitude than were service class employees. This implies that differences in the probability of extrinsic work attitudes have been identifiable regardless of period, but that their prevalence has decreased since jobs involving features related to extrinsic work values have decreased since 1979.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine {{a number of}} issues related to the Italian youth labour market and, in particular, youth labour market entry, over the last decade or so. The Italian youth labour market has a number of characteristics, present to a degree in other countries, but which by by their {{pronounced}} character mark it apart from other European Countries. The analysis presented here is essentially motivated by concern with two of these: a) the very high youth unemployment rate, and, above-all high ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates; and, b) the strong and increasing tendency for youngish Italians to remain in the parental home. The paper takes a broad approach to the analysis of these questions looking first at time trends in labour market entry, human capital accumulation, home leaving and family formation on the basis of information contained in the Italian Labour Force Survey using also the Bank of ItalyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs Survey on Household Income and Wealth. The analysis also employs a broad definition of young people which is extended to include young people up to 34 years old rather than the conventional definition using only 15 - 24 year olds. Reduced <b>form</b> <b>panel</b> estimates of the determinants of the behavioural variables are derived. The approach adopted is close in spirit and methodology to the work undertaken by Card & Lemieux (2000) in the North American context, OÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂHiggins (2003) on global trends and OÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂHiggins (2005) in the Italian context. It is complementary to the recent studies of home leaving and labour market entry in the Italy which tend to concentrate on single specific determinants of, for example, home-leaving such as in Becker at al. (2004) on the impact of job uncertainty or Mannacorda & Moretti (2004) on the impact of parental income. The analysis identifies a substantial impact of labour market conditions in shaping young peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs choices. The results also highlight the importance of distinguishing the effects of these aggregates by age and throw some light on the interrelationship between the phenomena under study. It may be seen as a first step in a broader research programme aimed at identifying the central factors driving young peopleÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs transition choices in recent yearsyouth employment; human capital; home-leaving...|$|E

In this research, a pair of two-span bridges utilizing full-span prestressed concrete <b>form</b> <b>panels</b> were fabricated and tested in the Karl H. Kettelhut Structural Engineering Laboratory at Purdue University. Time-dependent effects were monitored during the cast-in-place (CIP) concrete cure period of each bridge. 	At the conclusion of this period, each bridge was subjected to 5 million cycles of repeated service loading prior to a final loading to failure. In addition, one of the test bridges and five smaller composite specimens were exposed to a 15 % sodium chloride solution followed by 3 days of drying at a minimum of 100 o F. The durability of these bridges was then assessed by determining the potential for the build-up of chlorides at the boundary of the prestressed panels and CIP topping, and the resistance of the reinforcement to corrosion induced by chlorides. 	This study found that the PCA and CTL methods considerably overestimated the negative moments due to the restraint of time-dependent deformations in the laboratory test bridges. The negative restraint moments could be more accurately determined using a new method proposed in this report. The proposed method includes the effect of cracking of the CIP concrete at interior piers. 	This study also showed that adequate long-term performance could be achieved with bridges constructed using full-span precast prestressed concrete panels. The 5 million cycles of repeated service loading did not reduce the continuity between adjacent spans. Durability cycling revealed that an accumulation of chlorides at the boundary of the CIP topping and prestressed panels would not lead to a diminished load-carrying capacity of the structure. Sever corrosion occurred at the positive moment connection in the diaphragm of the test bridge. The connection detail should be modified before this construction method is implemented in the field...|$|R
