When her idea to make a time capsule is chosen by the school, each child draws what they believe the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like. Lucinda writes a page of {{seemingly}} random numbers for the time capsule, {{which is to be}} opened in 50 years. Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish but Lucinda continues until her teacher takes the page off her desk unfinished. Lucinda goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found in a utility closet scratching numbers into the door with her fingernails bleeding.|$|E

5000|$|Entrepreneurial quality builds from creativity. Not only do {{entrepreneurs}} have an {{idea that}} they must implemented, {{they know how to}} implement it and are realistic in the vision of implementing it. Drayton says that, [...] "Entrepreneurs have in their heads the vision of how society will be different when their idea is at work, and they can't stop until that idea is not only at work in one place, but is at work across the whole society." [...] This manifests through a clear idea of what they believe the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> and a drive to make this come true. Besides this, entrepreneurs are not happy with the status quo; they want healthy change.|$|E
5000|$|We won't be able {{to detect}} the changes while they happen because they will be deep, but slow, and will take centuries to fully develop. <b>Future</b> generations <b>will</b> <b>look</b> unto us as an era of {{permanent}} turmoil, but not all of us will live realizing this.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Lynda Gratton {{founded the}} Future of Work Research Consortium, {{which is a}} {{collaborative}} research project that creates insights into what the <b>future</b> of work <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, and how organisations can prepare.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{experts in}} some studies argue that role {{thinking}} does {{not contribute to}} the accuracy of the forecast. The discipline of demand planning, also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting, embraces both statistical forecasting and a consensus process. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting, is the relationship it holds with planning. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like. There is no single right forecasting method to use. Selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions (data etc.). A good place to find a method, is by visiting a selection tree. An example of a selection tree can be found here.Forecasting has application in many situations: ...|$|E
50|$|Also, {{planning}} has {{a specific}} process and {{is necessary for}} multiple occupations (particularly in fields such as management, business, etc.). In each field there are different types of plans that help companies achieve efficiency and effectiveness. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the relationship it holds to forecasting. Forecasting {{can be described as}} predicting what the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like for multiple scenarios. Planning combines forecasting with preparation of scenarios and how to react to them. Planning {{is one of the most}} important project management and time management techniques. Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. If a person does it effectively, they can reduce much the necessary time and effort of achieving the goal. A plan is like a map. When following a plan, a person can see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they are from their destination.|$|E

"To {{build trust}} and confidence, Kosovo {{authorities}} {{need to be}} attentive to culture and religious symbols, such as the Serb Orthodox cemetery in Mitrovica, on the Albanian, south, bank of the Ibar. The main Albanian cemetery is in the North and intact. The Serb cemetery is devastated, hundreds of headstones in shards and the chapel at its centre desecrated and burned. Most of the damage dates to 1999 and March 2004, but also to 2007 and 2008. The site is unguarded and open to sporadic vandalism, some allegedly perpetrated by residents of a neighbouring Ashkali settlement apparently seeking to ingratiate themselves with Albanians by lashing out at Serbs. Northern Serbs often cite the two cemeteries as signs of their tolerance and Albanian hostility. The Kosovo authorities’ failure to repair and secure the graveyard sends a terrible message to Northern Serbs: this is what your <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like, once you have integrated." ...|$|E

How could I be named Che and then do all songs about dancing in the club and who got the fattest ass? That would be an oxymoron to who I am. I think there's something very important in a name. So I think when we name ourselves and name our children, I think {{we have to think about}} what the <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like. I named my son Solomon, and when people look at him they say, [...] "Oh, Solomon, the wise king," [...] and I think he's growing into that role. It's evident even in hip-hop. You see people who are Lil' this and Young that. What do they do? They act just like their name dictates." ...|$|E

Would they pay more attention to viral videos or the wave of home foreclosures after the late-2000s financial crisis? Moore meets with his friend Wallace Shawn and they discuss what capitalism and [...] "free enterprise" [...] mean. Looking back on his happy and prosperous early life, Moore reflects, [...] "if this was capitalism, I loved it... and so did everyone else": in the 1950s, the top tax rate was 90% and this meant that the country could build dams, bridges, schools and hospitals, most families only had one parent in work, union families had free healthcare, college tuition was free, most people had little personal debt and pensions were guaranteed. This prosperity was driven by the manufacturing industry, which benefited from post-war Germany and Japan struggling to recover.|$|E

Lucinda goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found in a utility closet scratching numbers into the door with her fingernails bleeding. In 2009, Caleb Koestler is a student at the same elementary school. When the time capsule is opened, Caleb is supposed to read and write about some of the capsule's contents. He is given Lucinda's page of numbers. His widowed father John, an astrophysics professor at MIT, notices that the numbers have a set of sequences, with digits referring to the dates and death tolls of disasters over the last 50 years, including 911012996, apparently representing the date and death toll of the 9/11 attacks. The last three sets of digits on the page are dated in the immediate future.|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen {{far-reaching}} structural transformations in the public sphere. Few topics have attracted more attention, wild guesses, and misinterpretation, than the prospective effects of ongoing changes in information and communication technology.
