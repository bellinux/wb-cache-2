Jones also said he did not think he got a fair say in his April meeting with Goodell.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Helen Carte in 1913, Rupert D'Oyly Carte became the {{controlling}} stockholder of the hotel group. In 1919, he sold the Grand Hotel, Rome, which his father had acquired in 1894 {{at the urging of}} Ritz. For the Savoy, he hired a new chef, François Latry, who served from 1919 to 1942. In the 1920s he ensured that the Savoy continued to attract a fashionable clientele by a continuous programme of modernisation and the introduction of dancing in the large restaurants. It also became the first hotel with air conditioning, steam-heating and soundproofed windows in the rooms, 24-hour room service and telephones in every bathroom. It also manufactured its own mattresses. One famous incident during Rupert's early years was the 1923 shooting, at the hotel, of a wealthy young Egyptian, Prince Fahmy Bey, by his French wife, Marguerite. The widow was acquitted of murder after it was revealed that her husband had treated her with extreme cruelty throughout the six-month marriage and had stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her.|$|E
500|$|In June 1947, {{after four}} non-title bouts, Robinson was {{scheduled}} to defend his title {{for the first time}} in a bout against Jimmy Doyle. Robinson initially backed out of the fight because he had a dream that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Doyle. A priest and a minister convinced him to fight. Sadly, his dream proved true. On June 25, 1947 Robinson dominated Doyle and scored a decisive knockout in the eighth round that knocked Doyle unconscious and resulted in Doyle's death later that night. Robinson said that the impact of Doyle's death was [...] "very trying".|$|E

500|$|Beauchamp's {{trial began}} May 8, 1826. After {{a change of}} venue was denied, Beauchamp pleaded {{innocent}} to the charge against him. A jury was empaneled, and testimony began May 10. Eliza Sharp recounted {{the events of the}} night of the murder and reiterated that Beauchamp's voice was that of the murderer. John Lowe, a magistrate of Simpson County, testified that he had heard Beauchamp threaten to kill Sharp, and said that on Beauchamp's return from Frankfort, he saw him waving a red flag and heard him tell his wife that he had [...] "gained the victory". Patrick Darby repeated his testimony of the 1824 meeting between him and Beauchamp. Darby said that Beauchamp had told him that Sharp offered him one thousand dollars, a slave girl, and [...] of land if he and his wife Anna would leave him (Sharp) alone. As Sharp had apparently reneged on the promise, Beauchamp told Darby <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the man. Other witnesses testified that Beauchamp habitually referred to Sharp's friend, John W. Covington, as [...] "John A. Covington", the name used by the murderer to gain entry to Sharp's house.|$|E
500|$|Takumi {{found the}} game's first defendant, Larry Butz, to be {{particularly}} difficult to write, and had to re-write him several times. Originally, Larry {{was going to be}} an [...] "average Joe" [...] type of character, who only appeared in the game's fourth episode, but after his inclusion in the first episode, Suekane and Iwamoto told Takumi to give the character [...] "some oomph". Following this, Takumi wrote him as a [...] "prickly tough-guy" [...] who had the habit of telling people <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them. Some of the higher-ups at Capcom did not like this, so Takumi changed him into a character who laments his lot in life, saying [...] "I'm going to die!" [...] or that the situation is killing him. The culprit of the third episode was originally going to be male, until Suekane pointed out that all villains in the game were male. The development team debated over what to do with the now female character; some staff members thought it would be odd to have a female character be the director of an action show, and some wondered what to do with the director role if she could not fill it. In the end, Takumi changed the scriptwriter character into a director, and made the culprit a [...] "strong, glamorous, fashionable, and cool-headed" [...] producer.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 February 1982 Pintarić {{managed to}} escape from the prison by simply adding his name to a list of prisoners to be {{released}} on a leave. Five days later, he wrote a letter to his attorney, saying that he escaped because writing petitions made no sense any more. He announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> [...] "a lot of people", and that what he had done was just the beginning.|$|E

2500|$|Days later, reports {{surfaced}} that Johnson {{was under}} investigation for allegedly telling a woman that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> her boyfriend then spat in her face at Kansas City's Club Blonde on October 10, just four days prior to his court hearing for a separate incident. Johnson's pattern of behavior {{could lead to a}} possible suspension under the NFL's personal conduct policy. Johnson made a public apology on October 22. As a result of his October 10 incident, Johnson was de-activated for the Chiefs' game against the New York Jets. As a result, Johnson was charged with simple assault {{for the second time in}} two weeks. The Chiefs indicated that Johnson would meet with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and would not play [...] "for the foreseeable future." [...] Goodell subsequently suspended Johnson for the Chiefs' Week 10 game against the Chargers.|$|E
2500|$|Referring to an {{incident}} that occurred on , 2013, Rodger wrote that [...] "he tried to shove girls at a party over a ten-foot ledge after being mocked but failed", and instead other boys pushed him over it. He said that he [...] "felt a snap in [...] ankle, followed by a stinging pain" [...] and [...] "tried {{to get away from}} there as fast as [...] could". Realizing that he left his sunglasses at the party, Rodger returned to retrieve them but the [...] "same people he had tangled with before began mocking him and calling him names, then dragged him into the driveway to beat him up". One of Rodger's neighbors said that [...] "he saw Rodger come home, crying" [...] and said that Rodger claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the men involved, and [...] "kill myself". Rodger told investigating officers that he had been assaulted, but they determined that he might have been the aggressor. He wrote in his manifesto that the incident was the final trigger for his planning of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 1976, Private Harry W. Hiscock {{was shot}} through the hand by an M-16 rifle fired by Sergeant Robert F. Henson from fifty yards away. Henson, {{attempting}} to frighten Hiscock, had loaded a blank round into his rifle, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Hiscock and then firing the weapon at Hiscock as he ran away. Once firing the blank shot, Henson chambered another round believing it also to be blank, {{but in fact the}} round was live and struck Hiscock once fired. Later reports indicated that prior to firing the second round, Hiscock had been told by other drill instructors that Henson was seriously intending to kill him and that he had best [...] "say goodbye" [...] to his platoon. After the incident, Henson and other drill instructors attempted to cover up what had happened, submitting false reports that Hiscock had cut his hand in the rifle range latrine and also had coerced other recruits who had been on the range that day to stay silent out of fear of reprisal. The coverup led to a scandal and several criminal convictions.|$|E

2500|$|The views predominating {{among the}} city's {{politicians}} {{and other leaders}} {{turned out to be}} closer to those of The Stranger than the Times. As mayor Greg Nickels put it, [...] "This is not about music, this is not about a party. This was about a guy who decided <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> people and he had the firepower to do it." [...] Several city council members spoke up against the [...] "quick fix" [...] mentality inherent in the Times editorial; council member Peter Steinbrueck added he was [...] "really incredulous over young teenaged girls going out all night unsupervised and mixing with much older people," [...] but didn't see that as an issue over the nature of the place where they had socialized. Sandra Williamson, mother of shooting victim Christopher [...] "Deacon" [...] Williamson, announced, [...] "I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that those raves continue… That is what I am going to do for Chris." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer added that [...] "even… former City Attorney Mark Sidran", whom they described as [...] "Seattle's best-known defender of underage dance restrictions," [...] said that [...] "Some tragedies defy any sort of rational response in terms of regulation because they're completely irrational events you can't really predict or prevent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Robert Slatzer (who later {{claimed to}} have been {{secretly}} married to Marilyn Monroe) claimed that a few weeks before Vélez's death, he interviewed her at her home and she confided in him that she was pregnant with Gary Cooper's child (by that time, Cooper was married to socialite Veronica [...] "Rocky" [...] Balfe). [...] According to Slatzer, Vélez said that Cooper refused to acknowledge the child, believing that Harald Ramond was the father. After Vélez died, Slatzer said he asked Cooper about the situation and Cooper confirmed that it was possible he might have been the father. Slatzer further claimed that he also interviewed Clara Bow (who had also dated Cooper in the 1920s), who revealed that shortly before Vélez's death, Cooper called her and screamed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> Harald Ramond for impregnating Vélez. Slazter claimed that Bow told him that she never believed Vélez's baby was fathered by Ramond, and that she was convinced that Vélez had attempted to get Ramond to marry her to protect Cooper's reputation. Biographer Michelle Vogel speculated that if Cooper was the father, his rejection of Vélez and their child coupled with the idea of having to raise a child alone may have sent Vélez [...] "over the edge".|$|E
2500|$|Larey {{then picked}} up Hollis' pants and pulled out his wallet and told the assailant, [...] "He doesn't have any money." [...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E

60|$|Like {{a soldier}} then Lenore {{received}} her mortal blow facing him who dealt it, {{and it was}} a sudden overwhelming realization of love. No confusion, no embarrassment, no shame attended the agony of that revelation. Outwardly she did not seem to change at all.

Where was the fulfilment of those vague, stingingly sweet dreamy fancies of love? Where was her maiden reserve, that she so boldly recognized an unsolicited passion? Her eyes met Dorn's steadily, and she felt some vital and compelling spirit pass from her to him. She saw him struggle with what he could not understand. It was his glance that wavered and fell, his hand that trembled, his breast that heaved. She loved him. There had been no beginning. Always he had lived in her dreams.
