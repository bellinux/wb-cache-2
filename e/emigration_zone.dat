40|$|The paper {{analyzed}} {{the dynamics of}} the emigration of the population of Serbia in the period of 1971 to 2011, primarily {{based on the results of}} the five latest population censuses. Special attention was paid to the spatial aspect of emigration, at the level of the lowest administrative units (municipalities). It was shown that the shares of persons working or living aboard were very uneven by municipality, and that the differences became increasingly pronounced over time. Very uneven shares of persons working or living abroad in the total population of Serbia by municipality, as well as the trend of increasing differences, also influenced the very heterogeneous spatial distribution of that emigration contingent. Based on the concentration of population abroad, as well as the percentage of persons abroad in the total population (in the country and abroad), the paper defines three "hot" zones of substantial <b>emigration.</b> <b>Zone</b> 1 (in the central-eastern Serbia) is traditionally a high emigration area, which, for all three observed points in time (1991, 2002 and 2011), had at least twice as high a share of population abroad as the average for Serbia. Zone 2 (in the south of Serbia) consists of the municipalities of Bujanovac and Preševo, where the majority of the population consists of ethnic Albanians. The shares of population abroad was already in 1981 and 1991 noticeably higher than the average for Serbia, but also significantly lower than in Zone 1. Between 1991 and 2002, the number of emigrants from that zone was more than tripled, and their share in the total population of <b>emigration</b> <b>Zone</b> 2 increased from 6. 1 % to 23. 1 % in 2011. Zone 3 (five municipalities from the Serbian part of the region of Sandžak) did not join the group of notably emigration areas until the 1990 s. Between 1991 and 2002, the number of persons abroad increased by up to six times, and their share in the total population of those five Sandžak municipalities increased from 2. 3 % to 12. 6 %. In this paper, all three zones were analyzed, as well as the structures of emigrants based on the length of their stay abroad, the country of destination and ethnic composition. For all three zones, it is notable that the countries of destination do not differ significantly in terms of length of stay abroad, based on which the authors conclude that new emigrants primarily go to places that already have formed migrant networks. In all three zones, the share of ethnic Serbs in the total population of the country is greater than their share in the total number of emigrants. Additionally, census data indicated that members of the local major ethnic group in Zones 2 and 3 participated significantly more often in international migration than "local" ethnic Serbs. In connection to this, the authors stress the importance of the political aspect of this issue, especially in the period of crises and wars during the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Migrations {{play a very}} {{important}} and significant cultural and historical role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have as a consequence brought economic and demographic changes and negative migration balance has been the main characteristic {{for a long period}} of time. Beside strong migration flows from Bosnian territory, internal population movements have also been very intensive, contributing to regional differences in population growth and leading to the development of immigration and <b>emigration</b> <b>zones.</b> At the same time, rural settlements have been registering a decline in population (some even ceasing to exist) while municipal centers have increased in size. To make matters worse, population reproduction has become questionable. The number of municipalities with decreased population has grown by about 13 percent during 1953 – 1991 period. Between censuses in 1981 and 1991, the number of municipalities characterized by immigration declined whereas the number of those with emigration characteristics increased. Furthermore, as a result of war and related problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1991 to 1999, only 24 municipalities now contain more inhabitants than they had in 1991. Also, the relationship between domiciled and displaced populations in municipalities is different, a fact which depends particularly on the administrative organization within the country...|$|R
40|$|Serbia is {{a country}} with a long {{tradition}} of emigration, specific economic and political emigration context, a large number of its citizens abroad, as well as their very heterogeneous geographic distribution and differentiated structures. The main objective of the paper is to show that between the region of origin in Serbia and certain destination countries there are ties, on the basis of which migrant networks originate and spread. Over time, networks towards some countries lose their importance or are diverted to other directions. Through incorporating a regional approach, the analysis includes the results of the last five population censuses conducted between 1971 and 2011. It is based on data on the number, share of emigrants from Serbia, with regard to the length of stay abroad, educational structure, as well as the most represented receiving countries from the regional aspects (municipalities and the intense <b>emigration</b> <b>zones</b> in Serbia). Furthermore, attention is paid to the possibilities and the main problems of statistical monitoring of international migration. Such an approach has both the research and the wider social significance, particularly because most of the population abroad covered by the census maintain ties with Serbia, often visit their hometowns and present an important resource for the socioeconomic development of the country...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades there have been changes in the nature of {{international}} migration trends and spatial mobility of population on the world level. This was influenced by significant changes on the political scene of Europe and the world, globalisation, international capital flows, technical-technological progress, the IT revolution and so forth. International migration trends are mainly analysed {{from the perspective of the}} recipient countries, while research from the perspective of the origin countries is much rarer, and especially those which include both aspects. At the same time, there is an evident lack of reliable information containing data on migration trends between countries of origin and destination, regional origin and demographic structures of migrants, which hinders a more detailed territorial analysis. Serbia does not have satisfactory statistics on international migration as well, even though it is a country with long emigration tradition. The census data on the Serbian nationals working or residing abroad, regardless of the relatively large census undercount, present the main sources of statistical information on the characteristics of Serbian emigration, and practically the only source of data on their regional origin and socio-demographic features. Regional differences in view of the share of nationals abroad are very pronounced in Serbia. They were established as early as 1971 the Census and confirmed by every following census. The 2002 Census results indicated there were three typical <b>emigration</b> <b>zones.</b> The aim of the paper is to determine whether there have been changes in the spatial distribution of the emigrants from the regional aspect of Serbia as an origin country, based on 2011 Census final results. The characteristics of the Serbian citizens abroad, according to age and sex, length of stay abroad, country of destination and ethnic composition, have also been analyzed in this paper.

40|$|Living {{there and}} Existing here : the Absence and Presence of Migrants from Madagascar’s Highlands]. For several decades, rural areas in Madagascar have been {{experiencing}} a continuous increase in <b>emigration.</b> In agricultural <b>zones</b> facing strong land constraints and without alternative source of income, migration is a mean {{to cope with}} growing economic difficulties. A high level of emigration of young people and adults is observed in Sandrandahy, an isolated and very poor village of the Highlands. However, the local social organization, way of production and wealth distribution are steered by rules and practices that are not favorable to a long-standing absence out of the village. The fihavanana, the basic social precept, which is source of different duties for everyone towards family and community members, discourages migration for it hinders the performance of these duties and causes traditional social relations disruption. Different strategies are thus used by migrants, to make their absence acceptable and maintain their local rights. The aim of the paper, using « Migrations à Sandrandahy » survey and qualitative interviews, is to describe migrants' relationship with their origin community, or how they continue {{to take part in}} local social life and meet their duties despite remoteness. By making non-migrants participating to the migration project, and sharing migration earnings with them, migrants can face the material and social constraints linked to absence. They can live out of the village and continue to "exist" in their origin community...|$|R
