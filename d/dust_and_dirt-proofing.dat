40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether occupational exposures to <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> {{chemicals in the}} Shanghai textile industry are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. Methods: A case cohort study nested in a cohort of 267 400 female textile workers in Shanghai, China was conducted among 180 incident pancreatic cancer cases and an age stratified randomly selected comparison subcohort (n = 3188). A complete occupational history {{of work in the}} textile industry was obtained for each woman, and was linked to a job exposure matrix developed for the textile industry to estimate exposures to specific <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> chemicals. Cumulative exposures to cotton <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin were reconstructed from historical and contemporaneous measurements. Results: After adjusting for smoking status, a trend of decreasing risk of pancreatic cancer was observed for increasing cumulative exposures to cotton <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin with a lag of 20 years. The hazard ratios for women cumulatively exposed to. 143. 4 mg/m 36 years of cotton <b>dust</b> <b>and.</b> 3530. 6 EU/m 36 years of endotoxin were 0. 6 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 9) and 0. 5 (95 % CI 0. 3 to 0. 9), respectively, compared to unexposed women.

40|$|Abstract Outdoor dust as a {{pollutant}} is also {{a transit}} environment for different pollutants emphasizing heavy metals. Commonly, it is urban population, who is exposed to the maximal adverse impact of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> associated pollutants. In most cases, urban atmosphere researches are implemented on a few permanent monitoring stations. Data obtained from these stations cannot be sufficient enough to provide a real picture of atmospheric pollution. The most detailed information is obtained from synchronous instrumental sampling (aspiration) and studies of indicator environments (snow cover, leaves). This research pursued assessment of levels of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> heavy metal pollution of near-surface air through different methods on the example of city of Yerevan (Armenia). The city area comprises a complex mosaic of natural and man-made sources of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> heavy metals. So, for many years Yerevan has been exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> associated heavy metals pollution levels. The research was implemented in 2011 through 2012 and included spatially coherent snow and tree leaf sampling, and instrumental sampling of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> allowed assessing <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> heavy metal load and contents on the entire territory of Yerevan, identifying pollution sources, contouring ecologically unfavorable sites and finally identifying risk groups among the population...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Endotoxin {{exposure}} {{associated with}} organic dust exposure {{has been studied}} in several industries. Coffee cherries that are dried directly after harvest may differ in <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin emissions to those that are peeled and washed before drying. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure personal total <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin levels and to evaluate their determinants of exposure in coffee processing factories. Methods: Using Sidekick Casella pumps at a flow rate of 2 l/min, total dust levels were measured in the workers’ breathing zone throughout the shift. Endotoxin was analyzed using the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Separate linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate exposure determinants for <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin. Results: Total <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin exposure were significantly higher in Robusta than in Arabica coffee factories (geometric mean 3. 41 mg/m³ and 10 800 EU/m 3 versus 2. 10 mg/m³ and 1400 EU/m³, respectively). Dry pre-processed coffee and differences in work tasks explained 30 % of the total variance for total <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> 71 % of the variance for endotoxin exposure. High exposure in Robusta processing is associated with the dry pre-processing method used after harvest. Conclusions: <b>Dust</b> <b>and</b> endotoxin exposure is high, in particular when processing dry preprocessed coffee.

40|$|Modern (sub-) {{millimeter}} interferometers {{enable the}} measurement of the cool gas <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> emission of high-redshift galaxies (z > 5). However, at these redshifts {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) temperature is higher, approaching, and even exceeding, the temperature of cold <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> molecular gas observed in the local universe. In this paper, we discuss the impact of the warmer CMB on (sub-) millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB affects the observed (sub-) millimeter <b>dust</b> continuum <b>and</b> the line emission (e. g., carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (1) it provides an additional source of (both <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas) heating and (2) it is a non-negligible background against which the line and continuum emission are measured. We show that these two competing processes affect the way we interpret the <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> gas properties of high-redshift galaxies using spectral energy distribution models. We quantify these effects and provide correction factors to compute what fraction of the intrinsic <b>dust</b> (<b>and</b> line) emission can be detected against the CMB as a function of frequency, redshift, and temperature. We discuss implications on the derived properties of high-redshift galaxies from (sub-) millimeter data. Specifically, the inferred <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> molecular gas masses can be severely underestimated for cold systems if the impact of the CMB is not properly taken into account. ...|$|R

Small, suspended particles of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> ice vary with height above the surface.|$|R

A systematic literature search of entries made in the MEDLINE-PubMed database between 1957 and 2013 was conducted to identify studies that had assessed the relationship between occupational exposure to wood <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> different types of cancer. A meta-analysis of selected case-control and cohort studies was subsequently performed. A total of 114 studies were identified and 70 were selected for review. Of these, 42 studies focused {{on the relationship between}} wood <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> nasal cancer (n = 22), lung cancer (n = 11), and other types of cancer (n = 9). Low-to-moderate quality evidence that wood dust acts as a carcinogen was obtained, and a stronger association between wood <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> nasal adenocarcinoma was observed. A lesser association between wood <b>dust</b> exposure <b>and</b> lung cancer was also observed. Several studies suggested that there is a relationship between wood <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> the onset of other cancers, although there was no evidence to establish an association. A meta-analysis that included four case-controls studies showed that workers exposed to wood dust exhibited higher rates of nasal adenocarcinoma than other workers (odds ratio = 10. 28; 95 % confidence interval: 5. 92 and 17. 85; P< 0, 0001), although a large degree of heterogeneity was found.

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{part of the}} {{refining}} of {{gold and}} silver molten metal, silver <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fumes are released into the atmosphere. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforces an 8 -hour, equivalent Time Weighted Average concentration limit for silver <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fumes of 10 µg/m 3. MSHA initiated a program to assess the controls that were being used to control silver <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fume exposure. Refineries were visited at six mines. The layout of each refinery and the controls used varied at each refinery. At each operation, personal and area silver fume <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> samples were collected to assess worker exposures and to determine sources of fume. Primary source of silver <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fume exposure was the pouring of molten metal from the furnace. Secondary sources of exposure included: precipitate mixing, bar cooling, and housekeeping. Guidelines were developed addressing housekeeping, exhaust ventilation, general ventilation, administrative controls, and system monitoring. In most cases, housekeeping and general ventilation were adequate; however, the exhaust ventilation systems needed to be improved. 1 INRODUCTION Silver <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> fumes become airborne during the refining step of producing gold and silver.
