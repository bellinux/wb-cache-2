40|$|Sudden {{application}} of heavy traction/braking torque induces flats in rail wagon wheelsets. <b>Flat</b> <b>wheels</b> generate high frequency impact forces sufficient to cause severe {{damage to the}} rail head surface. Early detection of flats would facilitate re-profiling the wheels before they cause serious damage to critical rail components, such as switches, crossings, and insulated rail joints. Although there are many sensors available in the market to detect/record wagon accelerations, there are no powerful signal processing tools readily available to detect the presence of <b>wheel</b> <b>flats</b> from the recorded acceleration signatures. This study presents two wavelet approaches to overcome the difficulties in the on-board monitoring and detection systems of rail <b>wheel</b> <b>flats</b> using vibration signals.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} wavelet decomposing {{technique}} using {{the average of}} the vertical vibration signatures generated at bogie frame with a view to developing the technique as an on-board rail <b>wheel</b> <b>flat</b> monitoring system. Although vibration signatures are affected by a large number of design and operational parameters, such as the track irregularities, the train bogie system damping and variation in loading pattern, the proposed method aims at overcoming these difficulties to provide clear insight into the identification of the existence of <b>wheel</b> <b>flats</b> even at higher operating speeds. The wavelet decomposition method presented in this paper shows that the absolute values of the 4 th level detail component of the acceleration signature averages clearly exhibit the existence and location of the <b>wheel</b> <b>flat</b> damages. One of the advantages of the method is its ability to display the 4 th level detail component as a 2 D plot that is easy to interpret rather than the 3 D plots traditionally used by other researchers as presented in the literature. To illustrate this approach, vertical acceleration signatures of a railway containing <b>flat</b> <b>wheels</b> in the front axles have been generated using a 2 D Matlab-Simulink dynamic simulation system model previously developed by the authors. The simulation results obtained for different operational speeds on a track containing large irregularities presented in this paper, demonstrate that the wavelet decomposition model is an efficient and easy method to identify <b>wheel</b> <b>flats</b> such that it could be integrated into whole-of-train on-board real-time condition monitoring systems...|$|R

The 10 degrees of freedom (DOF) vehicle model is built up. 90 -DOF rail model is constructed. The <b>wheel</b> <b>flat</b> excitation model is built up. The vehicle-track coupling dynamic model including <b>wheel</b> <b>flat</b> excitation is set up through nonlinear Hertzian contact theory. The vertical accelerations of axle box are calculated at different speeds and flat sizes based on the vehicle-track coupling dynamic model with <b>wheel</b> <b>flat.</b> Frequency slice wavelet transform (FSWT) is employed to analyze time-frequency characteristics of axle box accelerations to detect the W-R noncontact risks s which the traditional time domain or frequency domain method does not analyze. The {{results show that the}} small flat size and high running speed lead to high frequency W-R impact. Large flat size and high running speed result in momentary loss of W-R contact, and there exist security risks between wheel and rail.

50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The aim of Spoornet is {{to provide}} a {{minimise}} predictable service. In order to provide a predictable service, it is necessary to move trains safely and effectively from the place of departure to their destination. The keywords here are safely and effectively. Although support functions such as infrastructure and train control procedures are vital in moving the train, the train or rolling stock as it is generally known, warrants some attention. Defects on the rolling stock are very costly to Spoornet. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} a defect on the rolling stock that goes undetected can cause damage to the rolling stock and the infrastructure. This damage can eventually lead to derailments. Considering that a derailment can cost Spoornet millions of rand and cause delays to the services, it is only logical to spend time preventing derailments. It is for this reason that a workgroup was formed to investigate and solve the problem of defects causing derailments and delays by developing an early warning system. The need for an integrated train condition monitoring system became apparent when considering an early warning system. The objectives of the integrated train condition monitoring system are to provide train condition information to different users, and alarms on detection of emergency or dangerous conditions. Various train defects that may cause damage or derailments were identified. One of them being a <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> on a rail vehicle. A <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> is characterised by the flattening of the wheel on one or more positions on its circumference, so that the wheel does not have an even and completely round profile. Flat wheels are mostly caused by the wheels of a vehicle becoming locked during braking, and sliding along the rail track. The friction created by this action grinds a flat spot on the wheel. The <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> leads to a decline in the riding quality of the rolling stock and a rise in the levels of vibration and noise is evident. But more importantly, the flat spot causes the wheel to roll unevenly, creating impacts on the rail on some points. It is these impacts that can cause damage to the rail and the rolling stock. Depending on the length of the flat spot, the vehicle type and speed, the stresses may be sufficient to cause final failure of the rail or initiate fatigue cracks in the rail. Severe flat wheels are a safety hazard and can in some cases, cause derailments and consequent delays to trains. Smaller flat spots contribute to track deterioration and so increase maintenance costs by damaging the rails, sleepers and ballast. Flat wheels can thus be very costly to Spoornet and its public image. In addition to safety and economic considerations, wheel flats reduce the comfort levels in the passenger coaches and the noises they make is annoying. In an attempt to restrict the damage caused by flat wheels, most railway administrations place a limit on the length of the flats that may stay in service. But to effectively find a <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> on rolling stock is currently a very expensive exercise. Flat wheels can be detected by an audible knocking sound when standing next to the rail. This sound is impossible for the driver to hear and therefore goes undetected. Normally flat wheels are detected by random inspection of the rolling stock or when they are brought in for a routine service. The service cycle on rolling stock can be up to 24 months in Spoornet. Considering that a <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> has an impact roughly every 3 m, a serious flat generates roughly 160 000 impacts on a single trip on the coal heavy haul export line. It is therefore clear that a <b>flat</b> <b>wheel</b> can cause a considerable amount of damage between service cycles. The severity of the problem is however not accurately defined in Spoornet, because up to a few months ago there was no detection system in use to determine the distribution of flat wheels. The research department of the Deutsche Bundesbahn however considers rail fractures due to the flat wheels to be a serious problem with a significant annual replacement cost. There are thus sound safety and economic reasons for wishing to understand the mechanisms of flat wheels and to develop an early warning system using an automatic detector...|$|E
