40|$|A {{conservative}} {{scheme for}} phase transformations under mixed control {{of heat and}} mass transport has been deduced. Based on the conservative formulation of the Stefan condition for isothermal diffusion problems in two-phase systems by Illingworth and Golosnoy (Journal of Computational Physics 209 (2005) 207 - 225), a scheme for transformations under mixed control of heat and mass transport in systems containing multiple moving interfaces was developed. The scheme is illustrated for a phase bounded by two moving interfaces in cartesian, cylindrical or spherical 1 D coordinates and for a fully implicit time discretization. In the limiting cases the scheme reduces to either an isothermal diffusion case or the thermally driven transformation of a pure component, for which good agreement with analytical solutions is obtained.

The effect of variations in GI motility on the drug plasma concentration-time profiles of high permeability and high solubility (BCS Class I) drugs was simulated. Simulations showed that increases in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) greater than 10 % can occur when drugs that have an effective permeability greater than 0. 04 cm/min and a high dissolution rate (85 % of the dose dissolves within 15 minutes) are dosed during phase III of the MMC. 	Many explanations have been given for the appearance of double peaks in oral ranitidine plasma concentration-time curves. Using a discontinuous PET model with a 2 -compartment pharmacokinetic model, parameter sensitivity analysis was done on the following parameters: dosing time relative to the MMC, dissolution rate, effective permeability in the duodenum and ileum, and intravenous pharmacokinetic parameters (k 12, k 21, kout, Vd). Simulations suggest that the variety of shapes for ranitidine plasma concentration-time profiles with double peaks is <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> differences in these parameter values between individuals.

40|$|Solubility {{enhancement}} of poorly-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge and poses a practical {{issue in the}} pharmaceutical industry. The emergence of pharmaceutical cocrystals has contributed another dimension to the diversity of crystal forms available {{at the disposal of}} the pharmaceutical scientist. That pharmaceutical cocrystals are amenable to the design principles of crystal engineering means that the number of crystal forms offered by pharmaceutical cocrystals is potentially greater than the combined numbers of polymorphs, salts, solvates and hydrates for an API. The current spotlight and early-onset dissolution profile (2 ̆ 2 spring-and-parachute 2 ̆ 2 effect) exhibited by certain pharmaceutical cocrystals draw attention to an immediate question: How big is the impact of cocrystals on aqueous solubility? The scientific literature and in-house data on pharmaceutical cocrystals that are thermodynamically stable in water are reviewed and analyzed for trends in aqueous solubility and melting point between the cocrystal and the cocrystal formers. There is poor correlation between the aqueous solubility of cocrystal and cocrystal former with respect to the API. The log of the aqueous solubility ratio between cocrystal and API has a poor correlation with the melting point difference between cocrystal and API. Structure-property relationships between the cocrystal and the cocrystal formers remain elusive and the actual experiments are still necessary to investigate the desired physicochemical properties. Crystal form (cocrystals, polymorphs, salts, hydrates and solvates) diversity is {{and will continue to be}} a contentious issue for the pharmaceutical industry. That the crystal form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API dramatically impacts its aqueous solubility (a fixed thermodynamic property) is illustrated by the histamine H 2 -receptor antagonist ranitidine hydrochloride and HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. For more than a century, the <b>dissolution</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> has been shown to be directly dependent on its solubility, cçterîs paribus. A century later, it remains impossible to predict the properties <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid,</b> given its molecular structure. If delivery or absorption <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API are limited by its aqueous solubility, aqueous solubility then becomes a critical parameter linking bioavailability and pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API. Since the majority of APIs are Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class II (low solubility and high permeability) compounds, crystal form screening, optimization and selection have thus received more efforts, attention and investment. Given that the dissolution rate, aqueous solubility and crystal form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API are intricately linked, it remains a scientific challenge to understand the nature of crystal packing forces and their impact upon physicochemical properties of different crystal forms. Indeed, the selection <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal crystal form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> API is <b>an</b> indispensable part <b>of</b> the drug development program. The impact of cocrystals on crystal form diversity is addressed with molecular and ionic targets in ellagic acid and lithium salts.

The dissolution of potassium bicarbonate in dimethylformamide is experimentally studied indirectly at elevated temperatures. We monitor the dissolution via the homogeneous deprotonation of 2 -cyanophenol by dissolved KHCO 3. The loss of 2 -cyanophenol was detected electrochemically at a platinum microdisk electrode, and separately, the formation of the 2 -cyanophenolate anion was monitored via UV-visible spectroscopic analysis. The results presented show that the kinetics of the loss of 2 -cyanophenol behaves on one hand as a homogeneous chemical process {{and on the other hand}} as a dissolution-rate-controlled process.

The method enables the study of the solubility curve in a broad temperature range by means of an optimized single calorimetric run. The experimental equipment comprises a Differential Reaction Calorimeter (DRC, Setaram, France) and a conventional heat flow calorimeter (DSC 111, Setaram, France). The proposed method is applied to study the solubility curve of several organic substances (glycine, mandelic acid and a pharmaceutical intermediate) in different solvents. The applicability of the approach is specified and a general procedure for studying new systems is recommended. In the theoretical part a model is presented describing the dissolution process in the calorimetric reactor. The model allows to convert the experimental calorimetric data into the solubility curve. It can be further applied to predict the heat flow curve provided the thermodynamic parameters are known. The sensitivity of different parameters that affect the calorimetric curve are studied in detail based on a comparison between theoretical and experimental results...|$|E
30|$|The {{release of}} Si during the {{leaching}} experiments was initially {{too fast to}} be explained with the dissolution of crystalline silicates. In silicate dissolution experiments described in other studies (e.g., Rimstidt and Barnes 1980; Tester et al. 1994), the fast initial release of Si was explained by the highly reactive disturbed surfaces, such as amorphous coatings, edges, kinks, and micrograins, which dissolve quickly before the slower dissolution of the crystalline matrix starts. The sensitivity analysis performed {{in the present study}} confirmed this assumption, as it showed that Si release during the 7  days of the leaching experiments was mainly due to dissolution of amorphous silica (Fig.  9). Its regularly incongruent dissolution might explain the poor goodness-of-fit values calculated for the numerical simulation of Si release (Fig.  6). A second possible effect was suggested by the strong correlation of Si with Mn and Fe in the anoxic extraction of the Sinemurian siltstone, which might be explained by mixed layers of amorphous silica, iron (hydr)oxides and manganese hydroxides, potentially altering the dissolution kinetics of amorphous silica. The mobilization of Al from the Hettangian sandstone could be explained well by combining ion exchange and the equilibrium dissolution of amorphous aluminum hydroxide, while the same explanation overestimated the Al release from the Sinemurian siltstone, and could not reproduce the observed time trends. A possible explanation is that Al hydroxides contained in the siltstone were partially crystalline, while those in the sandstone were entirely amorphous. The quantification of amorphous Al hydroxides applied in this study relies on Al hydroxide dissolution at pH 3.7 (see item 2.3), which will include part of the crystalline Al hydroxides as well (Marion et al. 1975). A second explanation could be the dissolution of highly reactive disturbed surface areas of the Al-bearing minerals kaolinite and muscovite, as already discussed above for Si. The strong correlation between anoxic Si and Al releases from the Hettangian sandstone suggests the <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> phase containing both elements (Fig.  3). However, this correlation was not observed for the Sinemurian siltstone, although it could have been masked by other processes such as the dissolution of amorphous silica.|$|E
