5000|$|They note (as does Clements-Croome) {{that the}} three costs for every {{individual}} building are affected by a plethora of factors, yielding a wide variation in ratios. They suggest that [...] "perhaps the original 1:5:200 ratio was simply {{meant to be a}} statement to focus clients' attention" [...] on the importance of considering the higher staffing costs of a building relative to its operating and construction costs, and to encourage people to not be too concerned with higher initial build costs to improve build quality and reduce later lifetime costs. They state that if this is so [...] "then subsequent users of the ratio have misused it", and that the frequency of use of the ratio is not problematic, but that the authority and gravitas that are assigned to it is. They conclude that [...] "perhaps the most worrying feature of this whole discussion is how this passing <b>introductory</b> <b>remark</b> in the paper by Evans et al has gained the status of a finding from research carried out by the Royal Academy of Engineering, which it most certainly is not!".|$|E
5000|$|Ecclesiastes Rabbah or Kohelet Rabbah (Hebrew: קהלת רבה) is an haggadic {{commentary}} on Ecclesiastes, {{included in the}} collection of the Midrash Rabbot. It follows the Biblical book verse by verse, only a few verses remaining without comment. In the list of the old sedarim for the Bible four sedarim are assigned to Ecclesiastes, namely, to i. 1, iii. 13, vii. 1, and ix. 7; and the Midrash Ḳohelet was probably divided according to these sections. This appears from the phrase [...] "Sidra tinyana" [...] inserted between the comments to Eccl. vi. 12 and to vii. 1, and the phrase [...] "Sidra telita'a" [...] between the comments to Eccl. ix. 6 and to ix. 7. These phrases occur at the end of the second and third midrash sections, in the same way that [...] "Seliḳ sidra" [...] indicates the end of sections in Ruth R. and Esth. R. in the earlier editions. The commentary to iii. 12 having been lost, the exposition of the conclusion of the first section is missing. Nothing remains to indicate where one section ends and another begins, as there is no <b>introductory</b> <b>remark</b> to the comment on ii. 13. But an introduction is also lacking to the comment on vii. 1 and ix. 7.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Psychological {{game theory}} {{encompasses}} formal theo-ries designed to remedy game-theoretic indeterminacy and to predict strategic interaction more accurately. Its theoretical plu-rality entails second-order indeterminacy, but this seems un-avoidable. Orthodox game theory cannot solve payoff-dominance problems, and remedies based on interval-valued beliefs or pay-off transformations are inadequate. Evolutionary game theory ap-plies only to repeated interactions, and behavioral ecology is pow-erless to explain cooperation between genetically unrelated strangers in isolated interactions. Punishment of defectors eluci-dates cooperation in social dilemmas but leaves punishing behav-ior unexplained. Team reasoning solves problems of coordination and cooperation, but aggregation of individual preferences is prob-lematic. R 1. <b>Introductory</b> <b>remark...</b>|$|E

There are alternatives to using introductory remarks, but vocatives have a strong denotational meaning, and therefore can get the attention of the hearer irrespective of where they occur, whilst at the same time clearly demonstrating the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of the hearer...|$|E

40|$|A {{pedagogical}} {{description of}} a simple ungeometrical approach to General Relativity is given, which follows the pattern of well understood field theories, such as electrodynamics. This leads quickly {{to most of the}} important weak field predictions, {{as well as to the}} radiation damping of binary pulsars. Moreover, certain consistency arguments imply that the theory has to be generally invariant, and therefore one is bound to end up with Einstein’s field equations. Although this field theoretic approach, which has been advocated repeatedly by a number of authors, starts with a spin- 2 theory on Minkowski spacetime, it turns out in the end that the flat metric is actually unobservable, and that the physical metric is curved and dynamical. Short sections are devoted to tensor-scalar generalizations, the mystery of the vacuum energy density, and quintessence. 1 <b>Introductory</b> <b>Remark...</b>|$|E
