The restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya was recreated by Prasanna and Lekha Washington in Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013). Vaibhav Reddy compared his character in Kappal (2014) to Manohar in Mouna Ragam because of their shared effervescence. In one scene, which Reddy compared to the [...] "Mr. Chandramouli" [...] scene, his character pesters the heroine {{to fall in love}} with him. M. Suganth of The Times of India called the Malayalam film Bangalore Days (2014) a [...] "sort-of Mouna Ragam with the roles reversed", since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> man who is unable to forget his past love and accept his wife.

Director B. V.

500|$|On July 17, 1919, a new {{comic strip}} by DeBeck in the vein of Married Life on the sports page; Take Barney Google, For Instance {{differed}} in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> henpecked, sports-obsessed husband and his travails defying his wife. [...] Google {{was interested in}} non-fictional sports stories, such as the heavyweight championship between Jess Willard and Jack Dempsey. [...] It {{was not long before}} DeBeck refigured the tall, thin Google into the short, squat character he was to be remembered as, and the title too was soon shortened to Barney Google. [...] It was not popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug (nicknamed [...] "Sparky") in a strip dated July 17, 1922. [...] The dilapidated, blanket-covered horse became such a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that the character has been called the Snoopy of the 1920s—toys, balloons, and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky's image. [...] When DeBeck introduced the horse, he also introduced a little-used technique into the strip: continuity. [...] Barney Google went from being a gag-a-day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back each day, as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race. [...] The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of Comic Monthly—likely the earliest newsstand comics periodical.|$|E
500|$|... "Together Again" [...] {{was written}} {{as a tribute}} from Jackson to {{a friend who had}} {{recently}} died from AIDS as well as AIDS victims and their families worldwide, as stated in the liner notes of The Velvet Rope (1997). Originally written as a ballad, the track was re-arranged as a dance and house song. Jackson was reportedly inspired to write the song from her own personal experience, as well as a piece of fan-mail she received from a young boy in England who had lost his father. According to Jimmy Jam, [...] "it had a deep meaning for her because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> friend she lost to AIDS, but as with all her songs, she tries to make them apply in a general sense to anybody. The idea was to make it a joyous song musically". The arrangement of the song was constructed in 30 minutes by Jam, Lewis, and Jackson while in the recording studio. Once the melody was in place, Jackson finished writing the lyrics to the song. The song's sound was inspired by Donna Summer's song [...] "Last Dance". Jackson told MTV News that her inspiration to write [...] "Together Again" [...] was [...] "Runaway" [...] by Nuyorican Soul, as the song reminded her of being in Studio 54 in New York when she was a child. [...] "Runaway" [...] gave Jackson a kind of New York feel of disco and she wanted to do something like this.|$|E

She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom must feel around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it seem like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> relationship I was in, because I didn't {{want people to know}} about my parents.

[...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely about people in Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E
500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience {{wanted to know more}} about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early Japanese tale of [...] "Urashima Tarō" [...] {{involves}} traveling forwards {{in time to}} {{a distant}} future, and was first described in the Nihongi (720). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young fisherman named Urashima Taro who visits an undersea palace and stays there for three days. After returning home to his village, he finds himself three hundred years in the future, where he is long forgotten, his house in ruins, and his family long dead. The 10th-century Japanese narrative The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter may also be considered proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-hime, is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan. She is later taken back to the Moon by her real extraterrestrial family. A manuscript illustration depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last was}} {{tested in the}} English High Court in May 2005 in {{relation}} to Nazi-looted Old Master artworks held at the British Museum, which the Museum's Trustees wished {{to return to the}} family of the original owner; the Court found that due to the British Museum Act 1963 these works could not be returned without further legislation. The judge, Mr Justice Morritt, found that the Act, which protects the collections for posterity, could not be overridden by a [...] "moral obligation" [...] to return works, even if known to have been plundered. It has been argued, however, that the case was not directly relevant to the Elgin Marbles, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> transfer of ownership, and not the loan of artefacts for public exhibition overseas, which is provided for in the 1963 Act.
