40|$|Interactive Digital TV {{services}} are considered nowadays {{as the key}} element to introduce digital TV services and to encourage customers to invest in new digital TV appliances. Some time ago, the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) forum, which already produced a harmonised family of technical standards [1, 2, 3], decided to engage the work of defining return channels using the same medium than the broadcast “downstream ” one. Thus, the cable and the satellite medium have been endowed with their dedicated return channel [4, 5]. The last product of this work is called DVB-RCT (Return Channel Terrestrial) [6] and is intended to provide standard specification for interactivity in the UHF/VHF bands. Using the newly defined DVB-RCT standard as a companion of the world-wide proven, recognised and adopted Terrestrial DVB system [3], DVB-T is no longer limited to unidirectional broadcast, it can become a true Terrestrial Wireless Interactive system. The DVB-RCT technical subgroup performed a tremendous work to define the physical layer (RCT-PHY), the Medium Access Control layer (RCT-MAC) and the RF Implementation Guidelines. As a result, the DVB-RCT standard makes use of a Multiple Access OFDM arrangement, to constitute a high bandwidth Wireless Interactive Terrestrial Digital TV system. Officially approved by the DVB forum in April 2001, it will be soon published as an ETSI European standard (EN 301 958). Two European Research projects (WITNESS and IM 4 DTTV – <b>Integrated</b> <b>Modem</b> for Digital Terrestrial TV) {{have been set up}} to support the roll-out of DVB-RCT through extensive field trials and the design of an integrated VLSI solution for the user terminal. Thus, fast and cost-effective integration of the DVB-RCT standard in the Terrestrial Digital TV set-top boxes are expected. Following a presentation of the DVB-RCT technical specifications, the two projects dealing with the future of the DVB-RCT standard are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{of culture}} and worldview {{and their impact on}} students' {{learning}} of science have become increasingly important to science teachers. This study details work that I carried out in the period 1995 - 1999 which examined the effect of culture on students' conceptualisations of nature. It is framed as the creation of my own 'living educational theory' as I, a teacher-researcher, dealt with what I perceived were the cultural inequities experienced by students in my classroom. I carried out my first study with a group of seven rural high school students in the Far North of Queensland in Australia, where I was teaching in 1995. Later, in two visits to China, I was able to carry out the same sort of research with a group of seven Chinese college students in Jinan, Shandong Province, PRC, largely using the Chinese language. I used a naturalistic inquiry approach and a semi-structured interview technique to determine students' conceptualisations of nature. I have chosen to embed the results of these two studies within narratives that describe my experiences in the two cultures as I carried out my research. For each culture, I have also developed an epic description of the role of science from the literature and history of that culture. From my three sources of data, interview, narrative and historical description, I have made knowledge claims about the students' beliefs about the natural world. My research findings are ironic to me since they are diametrically opposite to what I had expected. Initially I had believed that Mainland Chinese students would possess a world view full of alternative perspectives to that of Western school science. My research indicates however that students in rural Mainland China hold a traditional and <b>integrated</b> <b>modem</b> Western scientific world view. Although some researchers in other South-East Asian communities propose alternative frameworks for ++the teaching of science, frameworks that are actually 'pre-modern' these {{do not appear to be}} appropriate for Mainland Chinese students. I had expected that the Australian students would bring a modern Western scientific world view to the science classroom. However, the group of rural Western students that I interviewed displayed a world view that is not recognisable as that of modern Western science. Postmodernism and other cultural and social effects appear to have influenced them to such an extent that some have clearly not 'crossed the border' to a modern Western scientific world view. This thesis reflects my desire to overcome the perceived problem of inequity in my own teaching. The knowledge claims made here give some indication as to how I may improve my own practice. A return to the classroom will allow me to continue the cycle of action and reflection by which I can validate, develop and refine my living educational theory...|$|E
