40|$|Instantaneous {{force with}} static {{deflection}} feedback model {{is applied to}} predict cutting force and dimensional surface error generation in peripheral milling with <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch end mills. It is demonstrated that the <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch end mill reduces the dimensional surface errors according to the chip regeneration mechanism. Unlike in case of uniform tooth pitch cutters, chip loads on each flute are different in milling with <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch cutters. The excess surface error generated by the flutes which have larger chip loads is removed by the following flutes which have smaller chip load due to the <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch. In order to predict precise cutting force and dimensional surface error for the <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch end mill, the chip regeneration mechanism or the static tool deflection has to be considered to derive the accurate chip loads. Predicted cutting force and dimensional sur face error show good agreement with experimental results. Up to 20 % reduction in surface errors is achieved by using the <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch end mills tested...|$|E
40|$|Tooth wear {{is often}} {{suggested}} {{as an important}} factor limiting {{the life span of}} free-ranging wildlife. Given the frequent occurrence of poor dental health in captive animals reported in the literature, one would expect tooth health to be a limiting factor in captivity as well. Additionally, it could be assumed that brachydont (browsing) animals are more susceptible to dental health problems than are hypsodont (grazing) animals, given current indications for systematic increased tooth wear in some browsing species. A pilot survey of necropsy reports of adult captive wild ruminants (n = 294, 12 species) in one facility was performed in order to test these hypotheses and to calculate the incidence of <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> wear. The overall incidence of <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> wear was 20 %, with a very high proportion of reports that did not mention the teeth at all. In contrast to this study's hypotheses, animals with <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> wear were older than animals that died from other causes, indicating that reaching above-average age was a prerequisite for the development of reported abnormalities in this data set. A grazing species (blackbuck, Antilope cervicapra) was most affected, whereas two browsing species were not affected. Affected species had been regularly fed on sandy soil, whereas browsers had received feeds from racks, indicating that husbandry practices are most important for dental health. There was a high proportion of reported serous fat atrophy in animals with <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> wear, indicating the clinical relevance of the problem. On average, adult individuals of the species investigated reached 41 % of the maximum reported life span. Although this number appears low, the lack of comparative data from other facilities does not allow for conclusions on the adequacy of the husbandry practices used...|$|E
40|$|Chatter {{vibration}} for <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch {{end mill}} has been simulated using time domain cutting simulation {{based on the}} regenerative force and dynamic deflection model. The time domain cutting simulation program assumes that the vibration of end mill can be represented by using a lumped-parameter model with two degrees-of-freedom. Furthermore, it treats realistic nonlinearities accounting for the variation of uncut chip thickness, the changing of cutting force direction. In {{order to get a}} stability lobe diagram, the results of many time domain cutting simulations are evaluated by the average acceleration of the tool vibration during one rotation. Predicted stability lobes are compared with the results of cutting experiments, and they show that an <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> pitch end mill can lead to an increase of stability. It is difficult to accomplish the quantitative agreement because of the assumptions in the modeling such as the constraint of tool motion and the treatment of process damping. But, the time domain cutting simulation can give the information to find an optimum cutting condition and a chatter free tool configuration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} critical and communicative oral health literacy (OHL) and oral health outcomes (status, oral health-related {{quality of life and}} practices) in adults. Methods This cross-sectional study examined a household probability sample of 248 adults, representing 149, 635 residents (20 – 64  years old) in Piracicaba-SP, Brazil. Clinical oral health and socioeconomic and demographic data, as well as data on oral health-related quality of life (OHIP- 14) and health practices were collected. The oral examinations were carried out in the participants’ homes, using the World Health Organization criteria for oral diseases. The critical and communicative OHL instrument was the primary independent variable, and it was measured using five Likert items that were dichotomized as ‘high’ (‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’ responses for the 5 items) and ‘low’ OHL. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions were performed on each outcome (oral health status and practices), controlling for age, sex and socioeconomic status (SES). Results Approximately 71. 5 % presented low OHL. When adjusted for age and sex (first model) low OHL was associated with untreated caries (Odds Ratio =  1. 92, 95 % Confidence Interval =  1. 07 – 3. 45), tooth brushing < 3 times a day (OR =  2. 00, 1. 11 – 3. 62) and <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> flossing (OR =  2. 17, 1. 24 – 3. 80). After SES inclusion in the first model, significant associations were found for low OHL when the outcomes were: presence of biofilm (OR =  1. 83, 1. 08 – 3. 33), dental care for emergency only (OR =  2. 24, 1. 24 – 4. 04) and prevalence of oral health impact on quality of life (OR =  2. 06, 1. 15 – 3. 69). Conclusion Adjusting for age, sex and SES, OHL is related to a risk factor (biofilm) and a consequence of poor oral health (emergency dental visits) and can interfere with the impact of oral diseases on quality of life. As low OHL can be modified, the results support oral health promotion strategies directed at improving critical and communicative oral health literacy in adult populations...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The study {{aimed to}} compare the oral health variables, general, and oral {{health-related}} quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety between spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and healthy controls and also to determine the key factors related to the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in the SCI patients. Methods A total of 203 SCI patients and 203 healthy controls were enrolled. Patients and healthy adults were invited to attend a dental clinic to complete the study measures and undergo oral clinical examinations. OHRQoL was assessed by the 14 -item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14), and the general health-related quality of life (GHRQoL) was evaluated by SF- 36. In SCI patients, depression and anxiety were recorded using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), while Functional Assessment Measure (FAM) {{was used to assess}} dependence and disability. All the subjects were examined for caries which was quantified using the decayed, missing, and filled Teeth (DMFT) index, gingival bleeding index (GI), plaque index, and periodontal status by community periodontal index (CPI). Results The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed {{significant differences between the two}} groups in terms of oral health expressed in DMFT, oral hygiene, and periodontal status, controlled for age, gender, family income, and occupational status (p < 0. 001). Using the hierarchical linear regression analyses, in the final model, which accounted for 18 % of the total variance (F(126. 7), p < 0. 01), significant predictors of OHRQoL were <b>irregular</b> <b>tooth</b> brushing (β = 1. 23; 95 % CI = 1. 06; 1. 41), smoking (β = 0. 82; 95 % CI = 0. 66; 0. 97), dry mouth (β = 0. 37; 95 % CI = - 0. 65 to 0. 10) functional and motor functioning (β = 0. 32; 95 % CI = - 0. 45 to 0. 17), DMFT (β = 0. 06; 95 % CI = 0. 02; 0. 09), CPI (β = 0. 22; 95 % CI = 0. 04; 0. 04), physical component measure of GHRQoL (β = - 0. 275; 95 % CI = - 0. 42 to 0. 13), lesion level at the lumbar-sacral (β = - 0. 18; 95 % CI = - 0. 29 to - 0. 06) and thoracic level (β = - 0. 09; 95 % CI = - 0. 11 to - 0. 06). Conclusion SCI patients had poor oral hygiene practices, greater levels of plaque, gingival bleeding, and caries experience than the healthy controls. In addition, more number of SCI patients had periodontal pockets and dry mouth than the comparative group. SCI patients experienced more depression and anxiety, poor GHRQoL, and OHRQoL than the healthy control group. The factors that influenced OHRQoL in SCI patients were age, toothbrushing frequency, smoking, oral clinical status, depression, physical component of GHRQoL, and level of lesion.
