A literature search was carried out for articles published prior to January 2017 in PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Scopus, TRIP and ClinicalTrials databases; relevant articles included randomized clinical trials that compared materials used for <b>indirect</b> pulp <b>treatment</b> in primary teeth. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and extracted the data. The effects of each material on the outcome (clinical and radiographic failures) were analyzed using a mixed treatment comparisons meta-analysis. The ranking of treatments according to their probability of being the best choice was also calculated. From 1, 088 potentially eligible studies, 11 were selected for full-text analysis, and 4 were included in the meta-analysis. In all papers, calcium hydroxide liner was used as the control group versus an adhesive system, resin-modified glass ionomer cement or placebo. The follow-up period ranged from 24 to 48 months, with dropout rates of 0 - 25. 7 %. The material type did not significantly affect the risk of failure of the <b>indirect</b> pulp <b>treatment.</b> However, calcium hydroxide presented a higher probability of failure. In conclusion, there is no scientific evidence showing the superiority of any material used for <b>indirect</b> pulp <b>treatment</b> in primary teeth...|$|R

It has been shown that the complete removal of the carious dentin became unnecessary after the total tooth sealing, because the remaining microorganisms of the affected dentin would stop proliferating and/or die. This case report describes the management of a deep caries lesion of an 11 -year-old girl with great coronary destruction in the left mandibular permanent first molar. Infected dentinal walls were excavated with manual instruments and the remainder affected dentin was filled with ionomer glass cement and composite resin.

40|$|Objective Stuttering is {{a common}} {{childhood}} disorder. There is limited high quality evidence regarding options for best treatment. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effectiveness of direct treatment with <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> in preschool children who stutter. Methods In this multicenter randomized controlled trial with an 18 month follow-up, preschool children who stutter who were referred for treatment were randomized to direct treatment (Lidcombe Program; n = 99) or <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> (RESTART-DCM treatment; n = 100). Main inclusion criteria were age 3 - 6 years, ≥ 3 % syllables stuttered (%SS), and time since onset ≥ 6 months. The primary outcome was the percentage of non-stuttering children at 18 months. Secondary outcomes included stuttering frequency (%SS), stuttering severity ratings by the parents and therapist, severity rating by the child, health-related quality of life, emotional and behavioral problems, and speech attitude. Results Percentage of non-stuttering children for direct treatment was 76. 5 % (65 / 85) versus 71. 4 % (65 / 91) for <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> (Odds Ratio (OR), 0. 6; 95 % CI, 0. 1 - 2. 4, p =. 42). At 3 months, children treated by direct treatment showed a greater decline in %SS (significant interaction time x therapy: β = - 1. 89; t(282. 82) = - 2. 807, p =. 005). At 18 months, stuttering frequency was 1. 2 % (SD 2. 1) for direct treatment and 1. 5 % (SD 2. 1) for <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment.</b> Direct treatment had slightly better scores on most other secondary outcome measures, but no differences between treatment approaches were significant. Conclusions Direct treatment decreased stuttering more quickly during the first three months of treatment. At 18 months, however, clinical outcomes for direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> were comparable. These results imply that at 18 months post treatment onset, both treatments are roughly equal in treating developmental stuttering in ways that surpass expectations of natural recovery.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relative effectiveness of a participatory intervention process on the level of satisfaction for an employee benefits package. The main hypotheses attempted to determine if the treatment improved: 1. Posttest satisfaction scores of the combined groups. 2. Posttest scores for the direct treatment (delegate) <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> and the control groups as compared to their pretest scores. A randomized sample of ten per cent of the employees were selected and divided into a control group and an <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> group. A ten per cent sample of the <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> group was selected to form a direct treatment group (delegate). A questionnaire was administered to all groups to obtain pretest scores on old fringe benefits. The direct treatment group (delegate) was given a benefits package and after dialogue with researcher was charged with the options of altering, modifying or creating a new benefits package. Subsequently, the direct treatment group (delegate) informed the <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> group of changes. All groups were then readministered a new benefits package questionnaire to determine their posttest scores. The results show no difference in pretest scores among groups, the posttest scores indicate significant differences. A comparison of pretest/posttest scores for each of the groups indicate significant differences. The main implication is that participants involved in decision-making obtain greater satisfaction and hence, should be used for socialization by school systems. The study indicated that the new fringe benefits were designed to improve the quality of life yet maintain ones income at some parity level and hence, accounted for the improved posttest ratings...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} and cost-effectiveness of erlotinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment of {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. DESIGN. <b>Indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison and a cost-effectiveness assessment. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Those having epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Erlotinib versus gefitinib use was compared {{on the basis of}} four relevant Asian phase-III randomised controlled trials: one for erlotinib (OPTIMAL) and three for gefitinib (IPASS; NEJGSG; WJTOG). The cost-effectiveness assessment model simulates the transition between the health states: progression-free survival, progression, and death over a lifetime horizon. The World Health Organization criterion (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio < 3 times of gross domestic product/capita: <US$ 102 582; approximately <HK$ 798 078) was used to rate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The best fit of study characteristics and prognostic patient characteristics were found between the OPTIMAL and IPASS trials. Comparing progression-free survival hazard ratios of erlotinib versus gefitinib using only these randomised controlled trials in an <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison resulted in a statistically significant progression-free survival difference in favour of erlotinib (<b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison hazard ratio= 0. 33; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 19 - 0. 58; P= 0. 0001). The cost-effectiveness assessment model showed that the cost per progression-free life year gained and per quality-adjusted life year gained was at acceptable values of US$ 39 431 (approximately HK$ 306 773) and US$ 62 419 (approximately HK$ 485 619) for erlotinib versus gefitinib, respectively. CONCLUSION: The <b>indirect</b> <b>treatment</b> comparison of OPTIMAL versus IPASS shows that erlotinib is significantly more efficacious than gefitinib. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness assessment indicates that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are well within an acceptable range in relation to the survival benefits obtained. In conclusion, erlotinib is cost-effective compared to gefitinib for first-line epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

In the second method, the same conidial suspensions were applied on a sterile hazelnut branch placed in the Petri dishes. The LT 50 and LT 90 values of 1 [*]×[*] 108 conidia ml− 1 were 4.78 and 5.94 /days, for A. dispar in the direct application method, while they were 4.76 and 6.49 /days in the branch application method. Similarly, LT 50 and LT 90 values of 1 [*]×[*] 108 conidia ml− 1 for X. germanus were 4.18 and 5.62 /days, and 5.11 and 7.89 /days, for the direct and branch application methods, respectively.

40|$|Background: In 2004 Niger {{established}} {{a large scale}} schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths control programme targeting children aged 5 – 14 years and adults. In two years 4. 3 million treatments were delivered in 40 districts using school based and community distribution. Method and Findings: Four districts were surveyed in 2006 to estimate the economic cost per district, per treatment and per schistosomiasis infection averted. The study compares the costs of treatment at start up and in a subsequent year, identifies the allocation of costs by activity, input and organisation, and assesses the cost of treatment. The cost of delivery provided by teachers is compared to cost of delivery by community distributers (CDD). The total economic cost of the programme including programmatic, national and local government costs and international support in four study districts, over two years, was US $ 456, 718; an economic cost/treatment of $ 0. 58. The full economic delivery cost of school based treatment in 2005 / 06 was $ 0. 76, and for community distribution was $ 0. 46. Including only the programme costs the figures are $ 0. 47 and $ 0. 41 respectively. Differences at sub-district are more marked. This is partly {{explained by the fact}} that a CDD treats 5. 8 people for every one treated in school.
