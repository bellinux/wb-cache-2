50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> lags the actual vertical speed, the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the vertical speed because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R

40|$|The world {{tendency}} is {{the increase of}} the productivity {{and the production of}} pieces more and more sophisticated, with high degree of geometric and dimensional tolerances, with good surface finish and low cost. Rectification is responsible for the final finish in the machining process of a material. However, damages generated in this production phase affect all the resources used in the previous processes. Great part of the problems happennig in the rectification process is due to the enormous temperature generated in this activity because of the machining conditions. The <b>dive</b> <b>speed,</b> which {{is directly related to the}} productivity, is considered responsible for the damages that occur during rectification, limiting its values to those that do not cause such damages. In this work, through the variation of the <b>dive</b> <b>speed</b> in the process of cylindrical grinding of type ABNT D 6 steel, rationalizing the application of two cutting fluids and using a CBN (cubic boron nitrate) abrasive wheel with vitrified blond, the influence of the <b>dive</b> <b>speed</b> on the surface damages of hardened steels was evaluated. The results allowed to say that the <b>dive</b> <b>speed,</b> associated to an efficient cooling and lubrication, didn't provoke thermal damages (including heated zones, cracks and tension stresses) to the material. Residual stresses and the roughness of rectified materials presented a correlation with the machining conditions. The work concluded that it is possible to increase the productivity without provoking damages in the rectified components...|$|R

50|$|In aeronautics, {{the rate}} of climb (RoC) is an aircraft's {{vertical}} speed - {{the rate of}} positive altitude change with respect to time or distance.
