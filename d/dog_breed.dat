5|$|The Cattle <b>Dog</b> <b>breed</b> {{standard}} {{states that}} it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel (also {{known as}} the English Toy Spaniel) is a small <b>dog</b> <b>breed</b> of the spaniel type. In 1903, the Kennel Club {{combined}} four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed {{one of the four}} colours available in the breed.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} American <b>dog</b> <b>breeds</b> are noted {{to have been}} mixed with Spanish and French <b>dog</b> <b>breeds.</b> The European idea of {{registering}} <b>dog</b> <b>breeds</b> and breed clubs led to the foundation of Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1873. The American Kennel Club, prevalent in The United States, was highly influenced by this European predecessor. Currently, The American Kennel Club is the largest purebred dog registry, and registers more than 1 million dogs each year. The kennel club also organizes events for purebred dogs.|$|R
50|$|It is theorized (although not proven) {{that the}} various Carpathian Shepherd <b>Dog</b> <b>breeds,</b> as with other {{livestock}} guardian and Mountain <b>dog</b> <b>breeds,</b> are descendant from dogs that were developed somewhere around 9,000 years ago in Mesopotamia following the domestication of sheep and goats in the same area.|$|R
5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their {{depictions of the}} dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds.

5|$|The Pomeranian (often {{known as}} a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in Germany and Poland in Central Europe. Classed as a toy <b>dog</b> <b>breed</b> because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, {{specifically}} the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale {{to be part of}} the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz").|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable {{by the end of}} the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any <b>dog</b> <b>breed,</b> including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{study in}} Ireland found that dog bite {{injuries}} greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} legislation targeting specific <b>dog</b> <b>breeds.</b> This study also suggested that targeting <b>dog</b> <b>breeds</b> may actually contribute to increases in dog-bite hospitalisations through the reinforcing of incorrect stereotypes of risk being determined by breed.

5|$|The English Cocker Spaniel is {{the most}} {{successful}} breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due {{to the success of}} dog breeder H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 19301950. They are the second most popular <b>dog</b> <b>breed</b> in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.|$|E
5|$|The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breeds {{conformation}} show. It {{has been}} held in New York City, New York annually since 1877. It was held at Madison Square Garden {{for the first time}} in 1880, and is currently held in the modern arena of the same name. Dogs are first placed in breed specific classes for Best of Breed, with the winners moving on to the respective breed group. Winners from each group then compete for the title of Best in Show. In each class, the individual dogs are judged against the breed standard of each <b>dog</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beagles are the <b>dog</b> <b>breed</b> {{most often}} used in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used {{in a range of}} {{research}} procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{research}} people’s attitudes towards pit bull breeds compared to other <b>dog</b> <b>breeds.</b> The term “pit bull” refers to a type of dog with certain physical features including a muscular and stocky build, short coats, and a large skull with a square jaw. Over 20 different breeds can be classified as pit bulls and many people (including legislation) do not recognize this. Breed specific legislation often targets pit bull <b>breed</b> <b>dogs,</b> leading to <b>breed</b> stereotyping and an increase of pit bulls in animal shelters. In order to better understand peoples’ view of behavior characteristics of pit bull <b>breed</b> <b>dogs,</b> this survey asked questions about eight different <b>dog</b> <b>breeds</b> – four pit bull breeds and four non-pit bull breeds. The survey found that there are significant differences in the way that people view <b>dog</b> <b>breeds.</b> Overall, the majority of pit bull breeds behavioral characteristics (except Boxers) were rated lower than non-pit bull breeds (with the exception of the Rottweiler). Respondents’ 80 % accurate at categorizing breeds as pit bulls or non-pit bulls. There were no correlation between any human factor (age, gender, etc) and a person’s perceptions of <b>dog</b> <b>breeds...</b>|$|R
5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts dog show. Charles first became {{involved}} with dogs {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of <b>dog</b> <b>breed</b> clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any <b>dog</b> <b>breed.</b> Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle <b>Dog</b> <b>breed.</b> These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E
