25|$|The multiwell {{plates are}} {{manufactured}} to allow researchers {{to create and}} manipulate different types of assays (i.e., bioassays, immunoassays, etc.) within each multiwell plate. Due to the variability in multiwell plate formatting, {{it is not uncommon}} for artifacts to arise. Artifacts are due to the different environments found within the different wells on the plate, especially near the edges and center of the wells. Such effects are known as well effects, <b>edge</b> <b>effects,</b> and plate effects. Thus, emphasizing the necessity to position assay designs in the correct manner both within, and between, each plate.|$|E
25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but at least there are no pathological <b>edge</b> <b>effects.</b> Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of spatial pattern in plant ecology usually implies {{the solution of}} some <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> problems. We present in this paper some explicit formulas of <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> correction that should enable plant ecologists to analyse {{a wider range of}} real field data. We consider the local correcting factor of <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> for Ripley's K-function, that can also be used for other statistics of spatial analysis based on the counting of neighbours within a given distance. For both circular and rectangular study areas, we provide a review of explicit formulas and an extension of these formulas for long and narrow plots.

An example in forest ecology, where the soil characteristics determine a study plot of complex shape, illustrates how this <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> correction can be effective in avoiding misinterpretations.

This paper designs a kind of parallel plate capacitance cylinder sensor with a metal protective ring which can significantly eliminate <b>edge</b> <b>effect.</b> Besides, simulation is shown using Ansys, a finite element software.

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>effect</b> {{tests have}} been used in a number of studies on obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), to test for {{evidence}} of mated female immigration into pheromone-treated orchards. This type of test compares obliquebanded leafroller presence or activity around the perimeter of an orchard against presence or activity in the interior. Higher numbers detected around the edges of an orchard would indicate higher levels of flight activity at the edge, a pattern that could be generated by high levels of immigration. Recent work has shown that the spatial distribution of recaptured obliquebanded leafroller adults released from a single location can be directionally biased, which could obscure the ability to detect an <b>edge</b> <b>effect.</b> To test this theory, data from an orchard study conducted in 1991 that found no significant <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> was reanalyzed. When we accounted for the directional bias in the distribution of first-generation mated female moths, we found an <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> with significantly more mated females captured in the edge traps than in the center or mid-interior traps.

40|$|Background: Spatial {{accessibility}} {{indices are}} increasingly applied when investigating inequalities in health. Although most studies are making mentions of potential errors {{caused by the}} <b>edge</b> <b>effect,</b> many acknowledge having neglected to consider this concern by establishing spatial analyses within a finite region, settling for hypothesizing that accessibility to facilities will be under-reported. Our study seeks to assess the <b>effect</b> of <b>edge</b> on the accuracy of defining healthcare provider access by comparing healthcare provider accessibility accounting or not for the <b>edge</b> <b>effect,</b> in a real-world application. Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} the department of Nord, France. The statistical unit we use is the French census block known as 'IRIS' (Ilot Regroupe pour l'Information Statistique), defined by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies. The geographical accessibility indicator used is the "Index of Spatial Accessibility" (ISA), based on the E 2 SFCA algorithm. We calculated ISA for the pregnant women population by selecting three types of healthcare providers: general practitioners, gynecologists and midwives. We compared ISA variation when accounting or not <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> in urban and rural zones. The GIS method was then employed to determine global and local autocor-relation. Lastly, we compared the relationship between socioeconomic distress index and ISA, when accounting or not for the <b>edge</b> <b>effect,</b> to fully evaluate its impact. Results: The results revealed that on average ISA when offer and demand beyond the boundary were included is slightly below ISA when not accounting for the <b>edge</b> <b>effect,</b> and we found that the IRIS value was more likely to deteriorate than improve. Moreover, <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> impact can vary widely by health provider type. There is greater variability within the rural IRIS group than within the urban IRIS group. We found a positive correlation between socioeconomic distress variables and composite ISA. Spatial analysis results (such as Moran's spatial autocorrelation index and local indicators of spatial autocorrelation) are not really impacted. Conclusion: Our research has revealed minor accessibility variation when <b>edge</b> <b>effect</b> has been considered in a French context. No general statement can be set up because intensity of impact varies according to healthcare provider type, territorial organization and methodology used to measure the accessibility to healthcare. Additional researches are required in order to distinguish what findings are specific to a territory and others common to different countries. It constitute a promising direction to determine more precisely healthcare shortage areas and then to fight against social health inequalities...|$|R
