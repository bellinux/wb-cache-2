25|$|The {{electricity}} sector enjoys several tax exemptions: {{import tax}} <b>exemptions</b> <b>for</b> <b>fuels</b> used by ENEE and other power companies for electricity generation, import and sales taxes on {{equipment and materials}} for rural electrification projects, import taxes on equipment and materials for power plants using renewable energy sources, and sales tax on electricity sales. According to the World Bank, the total average annual tax exemptions are estimated at about US$108 million, mostly fuel taxes (US$64.8 million) and sales taxes on electricity consumption (US$37.8 million).|$|R
2500|$|In the American {{market the}} 2016 model year Toyota Mirai started at [...] before any {{government}} incentives, and a leasing option for 36 months is available with a $3,649 down payment and a lease rate of $499 per month. Several states have established incentives and tax <b>exemptions</b> <b>for</b> <b>fuel</b> cell vehicles. As a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV), the Mirai {{is eligible for}} a purchase rebate in California of [...] through the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. The federal tax credit <b>for</b> <b>fuel</b> cell vehicles originally expired on 31 December 2014, but was retroactively extended through 31 December 2016. By September 2016, Toyota had reduced down-payment from $3,649 to $2,499 and leasing price to $349/month with several benefits, and sold 710 Mirais. By the end of April 2017, 1523 Mirais have been sold in the U.S.|$|R

Norway is putting effort into establishing hydrogen as a transportation fuel by offering tax <b>exemptions</b> and incentives <b>for</b> <b>fuel</b> cell vehicles [4]. Norway {{already has a}} pioneering role in hydrogen production [5].|$|R
50|$|Finland was {{the first}} country in the 1990s to {{introduce}} a CO2 tax, initially with few <b>exemptions</b> <b>for</b> specific <b>fuels</b> or sectors. Since then, however, energy taxation has been changed many times and substantially. These changes {{were related to the}} opening of the Nordic electricity market. Other Nordic countries exempted energy-intensive industries, and Finnish industries felt disadvantaged by this. Finland did place a border tax on imported electricity, but this was found to be out of line with EU single market legislation. Changes were then made to the carbon tax to partially exclude energy-intensive firms. This had the effect of increasing the costs of reducing CO2 emissions (p. 16).|$|R
50|$|The main fuel tax in Australia is an excise tax, {{to which}} is added a Goods and Services Tax ("GST"). Both taxes are levied {{by the federal}} government. In Australia, like Canada, the GST (in Australia's case of 10%) is applied {{on top of the}} fuel excise tax. In some cases, {{businesses}} may be entitled to <b>exemptions</b> or rebates <b>for</b> <b>fuel</b> excise tax, including tax credits and certain excise-free fuel sources.|$|R
30|$|The environmental, {{social, and}} {{economic}} impacts of bioenergy development depend greatly on local circumstances (UN-Energy 2007). There are several {{policies and measures}} in the EU that support bioenergy and stipulate targets (McCormick and Kåberger 2007). For example, Finland aims to increase the annual use of forest chips to 12 million m 3 by 2020 (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2008). Current Finnish government incentives and policy measures for energy wood production include: (1) an environmental tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> wood-based <b>fuels</b> used <b>for</b> heat production, (2) a general tax refund for power plants using forest chips as fuel, and (3) a subsidy and financial aid for using small-sized trees from precommercial thinning and for the production and use of forest chips (Hakkila 2006).|$|R
40|$|The large {{potential}} for energy saving by cogeneration and trigeneration {{in the building}} sector is scarcely exploited due {{to a number of}} obstacles in making the investment attractive. The analyst often encounters difficulties in identifying optimal design and operation strategies, since a number of factors, either endogenous (i. e. related with the energy load profiles) and exogenous (i. e. related with external conditions like energy prices and support mechanisms), influence the economic viability. In this paper a decision tool is presented, that simultaneously optimizes the plant lay-out, the sizes of the main components and their operation strategy. For a specific building in the hotel sector, a preliminary analysis is performed to identify the most promising plant configuration, in terms of type of cogeneration unit (either microturbine or diesel oil/natural gas-fuelled reciprocate engine) and of absorption chiller. Then, some sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects induced by: a) tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> the <b>fuel</b> consumed in “efficient cogeneration” mode, b) dynamic behaviour of the prime mover and consequent capability to rapidly adjust its load level to follow the energy loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of polygeneration systems, {{in terms of}} profitability, energy saving and pollutant emissions reduction, highly depends on several factors such as plant efficiency, local normative and tariff conditions and reference technologies adopted to compare the results. In Part I of this paper a reliable tool was described, capable of optimizing the lay-out, design and operation of an integrated polygeneration system serving a cluster of buildings with their heat, cooling and power demand; the tool represents an excellent instrument to perform sensitivity analyses, thus enabling the analyst to formulate general design criteria and predict the effects of {{any change in the}} boundary conditions or in the normative provisions concerning support mechanisms for polygeneration plants. In this Part II of the paper, with reference to a cluster of four buildings located over a small area, once assumed a fixed topology of the site (in terms of distance between buildings) the sensitivity of plant design and operation is investigated, posing a particular focus on some context conditions: (1) the minimum primary energy saving imposed for the ‘‘high efficient cogeneration’’ assessment, (2) the reference efficiency of ‘‘separate power production’’ systems adopted to evaluate energy savings, (3) the local energy prices and (4) the incidence of tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> the <b>fuel</b> consumed by polygeneration plants. The sensitivity analyses are preceded by an accurate study on the robustness of solutions, performed by assuming different widths of the temporal basis adopted for the optimization. The proposed study offers a comprehensive view and interesting insights as concerns the viability of polygeneration systems for buildings applications...|$|R
