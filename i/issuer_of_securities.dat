40|$|The {{relationship}} between the issuer and subscribers of securities has traditionally been based {{on the law of}} contract whereby misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, will result in the contract being rendered voidable. In addition, the law imposes an obligation on the <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> to disclose certain specified 1 and relevant 2 information.

40|$|Statutory {{definitions}} {{of what constitutes}} an “insider” {{for the purposes of}} insider trading laws may be based on either a “person connection” approach or an “information connection” approach. The “person connection” approach defines “insider” by reference to the relationship of the person to the public <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities,</b> while the “information connection” approach considers anyone who has material price-sensitive information about the issuer to be an insider, regardless of his or her relationship to the issuer. In common with Japan, Hong Kong and China, New Zealand’s insider trading law — the Securities Markets Act 1988 — uses a person connection approach in its definition of “insider”. Other jurisdictions, however, including both the United Kingdom and Australia, have, to varying degrees, recently amended their definitions to reflect the information connection approach. The United States, although the first country {{to address the issue of}} insider trading, lacks a statutory definition of “insider” and instead relies on generally applicable laws against securities fraud. It has developed a definition with elements of both approaches. This paper reviews the definitions in use in the United States and in other countries (including New Zealand) which have been influenced by the American experience. It concludes that the narrow, relationship-based approach does not capture some conduct that may be damaging to the integrity of the securities market. A definition based on the information connection approach (perhaps combined with elements of the person connection approach) may therefore be preferable to New Zealand’s current definition...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{presents}} the basic characteristics of debt securities and shares and analyses the amount, structure {{and characteristics of}} the securities portfolio in Croatian banks in period from 1993 to 2004. The analysis shows that in the entire analyzed period Republic of Croatia together with state funds and other public institutions was the main <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> that banks have in their portfolios. The securities issued by banks and companies represent only a marginal part of banks’ portfolios {{but it is also}} true that banks have strongly supported the privatization process of state owned companies by providing credit for purchasing of shares and later on swapping their credit claims for shares. In this way banks acquired a significant portfolio of shares that they later sold on the open market. Data about the significant reduction of securities portfolio in the banking assets structure, from 46. 1 % in 1993 to only 10. 6 % in 2004, is indicative of a low level of trading in securities. This means that in the following years, central and local government should secure the necessary funds more by issuing securities than by credit, especially not by taking credit from abroad. Furthermore, in order to spread business with securities, banks should also substitute a portion of their credit portfolio with short and long term securities. In this way, the investors would be able to use the benefits of investing in securities instead of investing their funds in bank deposits as they have done until now...|$|E
40|$|A lack of {{uniformity}} in laws regulating professionals such as auditors {{and lawyers}} {{in relation to}} defective prospectuses exists across nations around the world. Securities legislation of some jurisdictions clearly imposes criminal liabilities for defective prospectuses on professionals along with directors and promoters of the <b>issuer</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> But the laws of some other countries are ambiguous in this regard. Such an ambiguity {{is present in the}} securities legislation of the United States, Australia and Canada. Their legislation does not categorically name the persons who should be criminally liable for a defective prospectus; nonetheless auditors and lawyers are sometimes caught by virtue of judicial interpretations of those vague legal provisions. Even though they could be on the hook under such interpretations, legislation provides a wide range of defences that facilitate escaping liabilities by offenders {{at the expense of the}} integrity of the market. Regarding sanctions, although the term of imprisonment is identical in all these three jurisdictions, pecuniary penalties significantly vary after the recent reforms triggered by some spectacular corporate bankruptcy taking place especially in the U. S. and Australia. Most importantly, the post-Enron reforms explicitly amend the laws governing secondary securities markets, and therefore their application to defective prospectuses is questionable except for the Canadian reforms. If the post-Enron reforms do not really touch the prospectus liability regimes in the U. S. and Australia, it can be said that the lawmakers have ignored their primary securities markets. If this is so, it would be an unwise policy to wait for an Enron-type disaster to occur in the IPO market for stimulus to initiate reforms addressing professional malpractices in the preparation of prospectuses. If not, the law should make it clear before it is too late...|$|E
