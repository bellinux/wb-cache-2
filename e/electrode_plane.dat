This paper presents an exact solution of dielectrophoretic motion of a polarized particle {{in the vicinity}} of interdigitated bar electrodes fabricated on pla-nar insulating surfaces which have been widely employed in conjunction with hydrodynamic forces and gravity to sepa-rate particles in field flow fractionation device[5]. We solved the electric field using exact mixed boundary conditions on the <b>electrode</b> <b>plane.</b> DEP forces exerted on a spherical parti-cle are calculated and particle levitation is studied.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} aimed at {{investigating}} the variability in resistivity changes in the lung region {{as a function of}} air volume, <b>electrode</b> <b>plane</b> and body position. Six normal subjects (33. 8 Â± 4. 7 years, range from 26 to 37 years) were studied using the Sheffield Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) portable system. Three transverse planes at the level of second intercostal space, the level of the xiphisternal joint, and midway between upper and lower locations were chosen for measurements. For each plane, sixteen electrodes were uniformly positioned around the thorax. Data were collected with the breath held at end expiration and after inspiring 0. 5, 1. 0, or 1. 5 liters of air from end expiration, with the subject in both the supine and sitting position. The average resistivity change in five regions, two 8 x 8 pixel local regions in the right lung, entire right, entire left and total lung regions, were calculated. The results show the resistivity change averaged over electrode positions and subject positions was 7 - 9 % per liter of air, with a slightly larger resistivity change of 10 % per liter air in the lower <b>electrode</b> <b>plane.</b> There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) between supine and sitting. The two 8 x 8 regions show a larger inter individual variability (coefficient of variation, CV, is from 30 % to 382 %) compared to the entire left, entire right and total lung (CV is from 11 % to 51 %). The results for the global regions are more consistent. The large inter individual variability appears to be a problem for clinical applications of EIT, such as regional ventilation. The variability may be mitigated by choosing appropriate <b>electrode</b> <b>plane,</b> body position and region of interest for the analysis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} several decades, {{extensive}} amount of research {{work has been done}} to understand the fundamental characteristics of the electrical breakdown. Breakdown voltage is a phenomenon where the quantity of an electrical force is required to transform the electrical properties of an object. Many factors that lead to the breakdown voltage are still not fully discovered. These factors are including the physical parameters of the <b>electrodes</b> (sphere, <b>plane,</b> point etc.) and also the environmental conditions. In electrical power system, high voltage (HV) power equipment is mainly subjected with spark over voltage. In this study, point <b>electrode</b> and <b>plane</b> <b>electrode</b> have been used for the experimental study of the short air gap. The electrodes are vertically aligned. In order to simulate the performance characteristic of the air breakdown voltage and maximum electric field between the conducting point and <b>plane</b> <b>electrodes,</b> the electrodes is taken into considered in this work using FEMM simulation. The air breakdown voltages between the <b>electrodes</b> (point and <b>plane)</b> are measured by conducting the air breakdown voltage experiment in high voltage laboratory and corresponding electrical field strength. The electrodes gap distances are being varied to 5 different gaps which are 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm. In order to achieve maximum strength in such a field, the point of the highest stress is controlled. From the experiment, it was established that the point at the electrode that produces maximum electric field is at the point with the smallest area or width. As for point electrode, the smallest area is at the angle of the electrode. Besides, it shows that the electrical breakdown characteristic is affected by the strength of the impulse voltage. Higher gap distance between the electrodes will result higher breakdown-impulse voltage while higher breakdown-impulse voltage will produce higher field intensity...|$|R

40|$|The fabrication, {{characterization}} {{and application}} of the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes for selective detection are demonstrated. The electrodes, fabricated by lithographic microfabrication technology, are composed of a planar film electrode and a 32 x 32 recessed microdisk array electrode. Different from commonly used redox cycling operating mode for array configurations such as interdigitated array electrodes, a novel strategy based {{on a combination of}} interferent depleting and redox cycling is proposed for the electrodes with an appropriate configuration. The planar film <b>electrode</b> (the <b>plane</b> <b>electrode)</b> is used to deplete the interferent in the diffusion layer. The recessed microdisk array electrode (the microdisk array), locating within the diffusion layer of the <b>plane</b> <b>electrode,</b> works for detecting the target analyte in the interferent-depleted diffusion layer. In addition, the microdisk array overcomes the disadvantage of low current signal for a single microelectrode. Moreover, the current signal of the target analyte that undergoes reversible electron transfer can be enhanced due to the redox cycling between the <b>plane</b> <b>electrode</b> and the microdisk array. Based on the above working principle, the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes break up the restriction of selectively detecting a species that exhibits reversible reaction in a mixture with one that exhibits an irreversible reaction, which is a limitation of single redox cycling operating mode. The advantages of the plane-recessed microdisk array electrodes are verified by detecting dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid and detecting pyrocatechol in the presence of hydroquinone, i. e., the electrodes can work regardless of the reversibility of interfering species.

Thus in this work, {{which is part}} of a project of the Hahn-Meitner-Institut (HMI), a novel neutron detector has been developed. In the central detector plane a composite foil converter (" 1 " 5 " 7 Gd/CsI) is located, emitting, after neutron capture and subsequent emission of conversion electrons, a detectable cluster of low-energy electrons. In two adjacent low-pressure gas gaps, sandwiched between fourfold segmented micro-strip gas chamber (MSGC) plates on each side, the clusters are pre-amplified in parallel-plate mode and further in the strong alternating fields between the micro-strips. The advanced micro-strip design is made in multilayer technology on a robust glass substrate. Two closely spaced <b>electrode</b> <b>planes</b> are used for two-dimensional position readout.

40|$|EIT {{estimates}} the internal conductivity distribution from body surface electrodes via {{the solution of}} an inverse problem. Most approaches require solution of a forward problem based on a finite element model (FEM) of the medium of interest. For iterative solvers, the solution time is typically dominated by the time to solve the FEM (both for estimation of the measurements and the Jacobian) at each iteration. There is thus a strong incentive to develop techniques to reduce the solution time. To obtain accurate forward solutions, it is typically necessary to model a large region {{far away from the}} electrodes. This is most severe in geophysical or endoscopic EIT applications where the medium is effectively infinite. However, it is also true of traditional EIT applications where, for example, the chest extends above and below the <b>electrode</b> <b>plane(s).</b> In these extended regions, we do not actually need so solve for the internal voltages; we simply need to model the effect of the extended region on the ROI.
