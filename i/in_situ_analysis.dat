40|$|We have {{identified}} novel nuclear transcripts {{in the human}} beta-globin locus using nuclear run-on analysis in erythroid cell lines and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization <b>analysis</b> of erythroid tissue. These transcripts extend across the LCR and intergenic regions but are undetectable in nonerythroid cells. Surprisingly, transient transfection of a beta-globin gene (epsilon, gamma, or beta) induces transcription of the LCR and intergenic regions from the chromosomal beta-globin locus in nonerythroid cell lines. The beta-globin genes themselves, however, remain transcriptionally silent. Induction is dependent on transcription of the globin gene in the transfected plasmid but does not require protein expression.

40|$|The {{presence}} of N-myc DNA amplification in human neuroblastoma tumors {{has been shown}} to be an independent prognostic factor predicting rapid progression of disease. Southern blot analysis has been used previously to detect N-myc amplification in these tumors. The authors report an analysis of N-myc gene expression by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization <b>in</b> 28 human neuroblastoma tumors previously studied by Southern blot analysis. In the LA-N- 5 human neuroblastoma cell line known to be amplified for N-myc, reaction conditions favoring RNA-RNA hybridization yielded an optimal signal. Using these hybridization conditions, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization <b>analysis</b> of N-myc expression in 28 human neuroblastoma tissues correlated perfectly with N-myc DNA amplification in these tumors as detected by Southern blot analysis. In particular, there were no tumors in which N-myc RNA expression was found by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> the absence of DNA amplification detectable by Southern blot, nor were there tumors that had DNA amplification in the absence of RNA expression. Heterogeneity of N-myc RNA expression was observed both among cells in any given tumor area, as well as within different areas of a single tumor. N-myc expression by <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization <b>analysis</b> was not observed in those tumors with more neuronally differentiated, ganglioneuroma histology. It is concluded that <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> hybridization of tissue sections is as effective as Southern blot analysis of tumor cell DNA in identifying human neuroblastoma tumors in which the N-myc gene is of prognostic significance...|$|R

50|$|A {{miniature}} {{mass spectrometer}} (MMS) {{is a type}} of mass spectrometer (MS) which has small size and weight and can be understood as a portable or handheld device.

30|$|Likely pigment identifications {{were based}} on the {{chemical}} composition from XRF analysis and were then confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> XRF <b>analysis</b> was considerably faster and positioning was easier than for the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> Raman <b>analysis</b> and hence many more points were analyzed by XRF than by Raman. In general, if all points of a given color had identical XRF spectra, only one or two points were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The presence of organic colorants (such as red lake pigments, organic yellow pigments or indigo) were inferred from a lack of elements characteristic of the inorganic pigments of the corresponding color and from the Raman spectra for indigo. Raman spectra from red, pink or purple areas colored with an organic red showed a highly florescence background with no identifiable peaks regardless of operating conditions. The behavior in UV illumination also provided an indication of the presence of organic red pigments and in particular for the organic yellow pigment Indian yellow.|$|R
