5|$|Bomar {{was born}} on January 21, 1901, in Bell Buckle, Tennessee to Oliver Eugene Bomar, a blacksmith, and Elizabeth May McAdams. Vanderbilt records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> spent part of his youth in Gallatin. Bomar {{attended}} Webb School in his native Bell Buckle, and spent a year at Castle Heights Military Academy.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{asked that}} Oviri {{be placed on}} his grave, which seems to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw the figure as his alter ego and the fox as {{changeable}} in its gender as he was (according to Mathews) and thus symbolic of dangerous sexuality. A number of sources indicate that Gauguin was suffering at the time from a syphilitic rash that prevented him from travelling to Tahiti for several months. She suggests the orifice is a pars pro toto for the woman who infected him.|$|E
5|$|II: The New York Times {{gives the}} place of birth as Kortrijk, while The New York Herald Tribune gives Brussels. It is presumed that the more obscure city would be the less likely error.

However, Cockrel himself <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would prefer to renegotiate an alternate agreement to maintain joint management of the tunnel between the two cities.|$|R
5|$|Serbian police {{documents}} from 1998 <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suspected {{of participating in}} the kidnapping and execution of nine Serb mineworkers at the Belaćevac coal mine, near Obilić. In 1999, Xhinovci was wounded in battle and airlifted to Germany for treatment. While in hospital, he grew a toothbrush moustache which {{attracted the attention of}} hospital staff.|$|E
5|$|Around 1000, Vladimir, still a boy, succeeded {{his father}} Petrislav as {{the ruler of}} Duklja. Petrislav is {{regarded}} as the earliest ruler of Duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary sources, which also <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in close relations with Byzantium. The principality consisted of two provinces: Zenta in the south and Podgoria in the north. A local tradition has it that Vladimir's court was situated on the hillock called Kraljič, at the village of Koštanjica near Lake Skadar, in the Krajina region of southeastern Montenegro. Near Kraljič lie the ruins of the Prečista Krajinska Church (dedicated to Theotokos), which already existed in Vladimir's time. According to Daniele Farlati, an 18th-century ecclesiastical historian, the court and residence of Serbian rulers once stood in Krajina.|$|E
5|$|Briskin {{was born}} on February 8, 1896 in either Riga, Russia or New York City. His Parents were Benjamin and Rose Briskin. Two of his brothers, Irving and Murray also became film producers, while his sister, Ida, married a film studio executive. Briskin also had one other brother, Barnett (Barney), who {{was also in the}} film {{industry}} as a theater manager and in sales capacities. While some sources have his birthplace is Riga, Russia, others <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in New York, after his parents immigrated there. Briskin was a product of the public school system. He obtained his college degree in accounting from the College of the City of New York.|$|E

5|$|First Officer John Rachuba, 30, {{was hired}} by Piedmont in 1989. At {{the time of the}} accident, company records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{accumulated}} approximately 4,507 flying hours, of which 29 hours were in the F28. Rachuba held a flight engineer certificate with ratings for turbojet-powered aircraft and an expired instructor certificate issued on August 16, 1987. He also held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license for non-federal control towers. Previously, he had served as a flight engineer on Boeing 737s and Boeing 727s.|$|E
5|$|Following Samuel Aba's death, Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and {{restored}} Peter. Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm, {{which suggests that}} Hungary became an imperial fief. He accepted the Emperor's suzerainty on Whitsun 1045, giving his royal lance to his overlord (who returned to Hungary). A number of plots to overthrow Peter <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> remained unpopular. Two of King Stephen I's maternal cousins (Bolya and Bonyha) conspired against Peter in 1045, but the King had them arrested, tortured and executed. Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul's exiled sons to the country. An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter's second rule in 1046.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped {{like that of the}} Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E

5|$|Once back in {{northern}} Thrace, Vitalian went into hiding, {{while many of}} his erstwhile aides were captured and executed. Nothing is known of him {{for the next three}} years, although a short remark by a chronicler seems to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> resurfaced and led another armed rebellion during the last months of Anastasius's life. When Anastasius died in July 518, he was succeeded by Justin I, the comes excubitorum (commander of the imperial bodyguard). The new emperor quickly moved to strengthen his rule, dismissing a number of potential rivals or enemies. At the same time, he called upon Vitalian to come to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Riel {{was first}} educated by Roman Catholic priests at St. Boniface. At age 13 {{he came to}} the {{attention}} of Alexandre Taché, the Suffragan Bishop of St. Boniface, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young Métis. In 1858 Taché arranged for Riel to attend the Petit Séminaire of the Collège de Montréal, under the direction of the Sulpician order. Descriptions of him at the time <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy, but exhibited a frequent and unpredictable moodiness.|$|E
5|$|Since 1789, {{the press}} had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however {{he was first}} elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow {{appointed}} to {{serve the interests of}} his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a charge for the impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.|$|E

5|$|Soegija {{arrived in}} Muntilan in September 1926, where he began {{teaching}} algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little {{is known about}} his period as an instructor at the school, although records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> based his teaching style on that of van Lith, {{who had died in}} early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's gamelan and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty.|$|E
5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his {{descendants}} remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune {{to take over the}} country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date {{may well be}} too late for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{received}} {{an invitation to}} {{become a member of the}} Knickerbockers a month or so after the team's September 23, 1845, creation. He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers. Records of the club's practice games <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18, 1845. In an inter-squad game held that day, which was the Knickerbockers' last of the year, Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton, 51–42. The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three-man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club. The committee's efforts were successful, and a game was scheduled on June 19. Adams participated in the contest, which the Knickerbockers lost 23–1. Batting second in the Knickerbockers' lineup, he made one out and did not score a run.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he belonged}} to a prestigious family, Cofresí was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maravedís in taxes, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofresí was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofresí's recognition by local residents <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
