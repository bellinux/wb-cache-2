5|$|The Carmel Mountain {{has three}} main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Siâ€™ach. For {{the most part}} these valleys are undeveloped natural {{corridors}} that run up through the city from the coast {{to the top of}} the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, <b>hyrax,</b> Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a watering hole before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on <b>hyrax</b> and rock <b>hyrax,</b> bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

50|$|The bush <b>hyraxes,</b> Heterohyrax brucei, {{are known}} to live with rock <b>hyraxes,</b> Procavia capensis and Procavia johnstoni However, {{different}} species of <b>hyraxes</b> do not interbreed because their sex organs vary significantly. Some behaviors observed in populations of rock and bush <b>hyraxes</b> includes caring for each other's young by sharing nurseries as well as inhabiting the same rock crevices. The associations observed between these <b>hyraxes</b> is variable and studies in Zimbabwe have shown that they often overlap habitats near parturition (the time of giving birth).|$|R
40|$|Feeding of rock <b>hyraxes</b> by {{tourists}} at the Storms River Mouth rest {{camp in the}} Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park, Republic of South Africa, has led to taming of the <b>hyraxes,</b> soliciting of {{food from}} tourists and occasionally to aggression resulting in tourists being bitten. As a result {{it was decided to}} capture and translocate a number of the tamer <b>hyraxes</b> during 1981. At the rest camp the <b>hyraxes</b> occur in well defined groupings (Fairall & Crawford 1983, S. Afr. J. Wildl. Res. 13 : 25 - 26). All the animals caught were from the Sandbay - office group...|$|R
5000|$|Captive rock <b>hyraxes</b> {{make more}} than 20 {{different}} noises. In a study of their social networks, {{it was found that}} <b>hyraxes</b> that live in more [...] "egalitarian" [...] groups, in which social associations are spread more evenly among group members, survive longer. In addition, <b>hyraxes</b> are the first non-human species in which structural balance was described. They follow [...] "the friend of my friend is my friend" [...] rule, and avoid unbalanced social configurations.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hyrax</b> Hill {{is named}} after the <b>hyrax,</b> a small mammal that lives in rocky areas. Hyraxes were once common in the rocky crevasses of <b>Hyrax</b> Hill, but their numbers have dropped in recent years due to the rapid {{urbanization}} of the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|The Torah permits only land animals {{which both}} chew the cud and have cloven hooves.

50|$|The {{species in}} the genus live in close {{association}} with rock <b>hyraxes</b> (Procavia capensis). These <b>hyraxes</b> have communal toilets or dung middens. These middens are a stable and dependable food source for Dicranocara in a resource scarce environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hyraxes</b> share several unusual {{characteristics}} with {{elephants and}} the Sirenia (manatees and dugongs), which {{have resulted in}} their all being placed in the taxon Paenungulata. Male <b>hyraxes</b> lack a scrotum and their testicles remain tucked up in their abdominal cavity next to the kidneys, the same as elephants, manatees, and dugongs. Female <b>hyraxes</b> have a pair of teats near their arm pits (axilla), as well as four teats in their groin (inguinal area); elephants have a pair of teats near their axillae, and dugongs and manatees have a pair of teats, one located close {{to each of the}} front flippers. The tusks of <b>hyraxes</b> develop from the incisor teeth as do the tusks of elephants; most mammalian tusks develop from the canines. <b>Hyraxes,</b> like elephants, have flattened nails on the tips of their digits, rather than curved, elongated claws which are usually seen on mammals.|$|R
50|$|All modern <b>hyraxes</b> {{are members}} of the family Procaviidae (the only living family within Hyracoidea) and are found only in Africa and the Middle East. In the past, however, <b>hyraxes</b> were more diverse, and widespread. The order first appears in the fossil record at a site in the Middle East in the form of Dimaitherium, 37 million years ago. For many {{millions}} of years, <b>hyraxes</b> were the primary terrestrial herbivores in Africa, just as odd-toed ungulates were in North America.|$|R

25|$|<b>Hyrax</b> Hill is a prehistoric {{site near}} Nakuru in the Rift Valley {{province}} of Kenya. It is a rocky spur roughly half a kilometer in length, with {{an elevation of}} 1,900 meters above sea level at its summit. The site was first discovered in 1926 by Louis Leakey during excavations at the nearby Nakuru Burial Site, and Mary Leakey conducted the first major excavations between 1937 and 1938. There are two distinct areas of occupation at <b>Hyrax</b> Hill: one which was occupied during the Neolithic and late Iron Age, and one which was occupied by the Sirikwa earlier in the Iron Age.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the zoo {{brought in}} a troop of guinea baboons, the largest {{alligator}} outside of Florida, moved their flamingos to another pond, and altered the old tiger exhibit to hold a rock <b>hyrax</b> {{and a group of}} colobus monkeys.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, the {{odd-toed}} ungulates were classified with other mammals such as artiodactyls, <b>hyraxes,</b> mammals with a proboscis, and other [...] "ungulates". A close family relationship with <b>hyraxes</b> was suspected based on {{similarities in the}} construction of the ear and the course of the carotid artery.|$|R

25|$|<b>Hyrax</b> Hill {{is located}} near Lake Nakuru. 5000 to 6000 years ago, during the {{occupation}} of Site I, a wetter climate meant that lake levels were as much as 100 meters higher than their present levels. <b>Hyrax</b> Hill was a peninsula at this time, which jutted out into {{the north side of}} the lake. The occupants would have had access to a steady supply of fresh water, as well as fish. Mary Leakey identified the ancient rocky beach of the lake in her 1938 excavations. The early occupation of Site I lies directly on the ancient beach, and she was able to use this and relative dating to date this portion of the site.|$|E
25|$|Somalia {{contains}} {{a variety of}} mammals due to its geographical and climatic diversity. Wild fauna are found throughout the territory, including the cheetah, lion, reticulated giraffe, baboon, civet, serval, elephant, bushpig, gazelle, ibex, kudu, dik-dik, oribi, Somali wild ass, reedbuck and zebra, shrew, rock <b>hyrax,</b> golden mole and antelope. It also has a large population of the dromedary camel.|$|E
25|$|Other animals {{include the}} monitor lizards, <b>hyrax,</b> sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dog, in perhaps only 14 {{countries}} and red-necked ostrich.

50|$|<b>Hyraxes</b> are {{sometimes}} {{described as being}} the closest living relative of the elephant, although whether this is so is disputed. Recent morphological- and molecular-based classifications reveal the sirenians to be the closest living relatives of elephants. While <b>hyraxes</b> are closely related, they form a taxonomic outgroup to the assemblage of elephants, sirenians, and the extinct orders Embrithopoda and Desmostylia.|$|R

40|$|Cutaneous leishmaniasis, {{caused by}} Leishmania tropica, has {{recently}} emerged in {{urban and rural}} foci of central and northern Israel, and constitutes a major public health concern. Rock <b>hyraxes</b> (Procavia capensis), the suspected natural reservoir, were trapped in the cutaneous leishmaniasis urban focus of Maale Adumim in central Israel and evaluated for L. tropica infection by real-time kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Real-time PCR on blood and computerized western blot serology analysis was positive for L. tropica in 58 % and 80 %, respectively, of the <b>hyraxes</b> tested. Phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 region indicated that similar genotypes were present in humans and <b>hyraxes</b> from the same habitat. The high rates of infection and exposure to L. tropica among <b>hyraxes</b> supports their involvement in the transmission cycle of this parasite, and their potential role as a reservoir for human disease...|$|R

25|$|A {{wide range}} of fauna can be found within the reserve. Four species of {{primates}} are found, the Eastern Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurtii), the golden monkey, the blue monkey, and the L'Hoest's monkey (also known as mountain monkey). Though not since 2002, a fifth species of primate, {{the black and white}} colobus has been reported having been seen. There are currently estimated to be 20 East African chimpanzees in the forest. This is a 54% increase in population size from the 13 chimps in 2008, when the GACP first started. This includes five infants. The average density of chimpanzee nests was found to be 1.473 per km2 by Dr. Plumptree. Other mammals include the red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), the black front duiker (Cephalophus nigrifrons), the southern tree <b>hyrax</b> (Dendrohyrax arboreus), the serval (Felis serval), and Felis aurata.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and RÃ¼ppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock <b>hyrax</b> (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
