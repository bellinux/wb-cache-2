Here, the case of singular <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrices</b> is investigated, and algorithms are presented under a rank condition that indicates the existence of a unique TLS solution, thereby adding a new method to the existing literature on TLS adjustment. In contrast to more general “measurement error models,” the restriction to the EIV-Model still allows the derivation of (nonlinear) closed formulas for the weighted TLS solution.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} have quickly {{become part of}} everyday life. However, wireless devices are range and data rate limited. To overcome these limitations one method is to use Multiple-Input Multiple Output (MIMO) links. The multiple antenna allow MIMO systems to perform precoding (multi-layer beamforming),diversity coding(space-time coding),and spatial multiplexing. In the novel Space-Time Shift Keying (STSK) modulation scheme for MIMO communication systems, the concept of spatial modulation is extended to include both the space and time dimensions, {{in order to provide}} a general shift-keying framework. More specifically, in the proposed STSK scheme one out of Q <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrices</b> is activated during each transmitted block, which enables us to strike a flexible diversity and multiplexing tradeoff.

The principle and some statistical methods of pooling data have been discussed by Bancroft [1], Kitagawa [1], [2], Bennet [1], Asano [1] and various authors and developed mainly in case when the observations were obtained from the univariate populations. Recently Asano and the author of this paper [1] dealt the inference of a mean vector and a <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrix</b> on the basis of pooling data in the bivariate case.

40|$|This letter {{addresses}} {{the application of}} Linear Dispersion Codes (LDC) in space and frequency domains in Single Carrier-Frequency Domain Equalization (SCFDE) systems. Space-frequency (SF) -LDCs are more suitable than space-time (ST) LDC in high mobility environments. However, the application of LDCs in space and frequency domains in SCFDE systems is not straightforward as in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems because in this case {{there is no direct}} access to subcarriers at the transmitter. This letter shows {{that it is possible to}} induce a target SF symbol dispersion in SCFDE by using a simple linear pre-coder and a conventional LDC that spreads the symbols in time and space domains according to specific ST <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrices.</b> The letter shows how to derive the ST <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrices</b> to be used at the transmitter as a function of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>matrices</b> describing the target SF dispersion. The presented procedure can be applied to both pure transmit diversity and pure multiplexing schemes, which are special cases of LDCs. Therefore, the proposed scheme provides a low complexity implementation of any dispersion in space and frequency over SCFDE systems, which alternatively would require the use of FFT/IFFT also at the transmitter side. The letter also shows a performance comparison of SF-LDCs and ST-LDCs in a typical propagation environment for future radio systems. The comparison confirms the suitability of using the dispersion in frequency rather than time for a wide range of coherence bandwidths...|$|R
