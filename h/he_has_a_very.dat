No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries...

25|$|In {{the fifth}} novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape returns {{to a more}} {{prominent}} role. With Voldemort having returned to a fully corporeal body, Snape continues working as a re-doubled agent for Dumbledore. He is seen {{prior to the start}} of school at Number 12, Grimmauld Place giving reports to the Order of the Phoenix. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strained relationship with Sirius, who owns Grimmauld Place and must remain there in hiding. The two trade frequent snide remarks and at one point almost begin a duel. Snape taunts Sirius about the latter's not being able to take an active role in the Order's missions because of his fugitive status. Harry feels later that this taunting contributed to Sirius' willingness to take unsafe risks. Back at school, Snape's allegiance to the Order has no effect on his dislike for Harry.|$|E
25|$|Staal is an {{excellent}} skater, adept shot blocker and regular penalty killer with the Rangers. Offensively, he is a smart passer who makes the intelligent plays to his teammates and generally plays positionally. Due to his skating ability, he periodically joins the offensive rush despite being a defenceman. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> accurate wrist shot and a hard slapshot that has improved in accuracy since his NHL debut. His improving offence led him to see more ice time on the power play beginning in the 2010–11 season, where he can apply those offensive skills more directly in the scoring effort. Upon entering the NHL, the Rangers coaching staff have primarily used him in a defensive role. However his point totals improved steadily his first few years in the NHL, and each year from 2007–08 to 2009–10, he established new career highs in goals, assists and points.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and {{unsure of}} himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer [...] "forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and [...] "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which he gestures to the Virgin gives {{the impression of a}} shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face [...] "twisted into an empty smile".|$|E
500|$|Strangers with Candy was {{conceived}} of as a parody of after school specials, following the life of Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old dropout who returns to finish high school after 32 years {{of life on the}} street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, politically incorrect moral lesson. Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, and portrayed Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, Chuck Noblet, seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on The Daily Show and later The Colbert Report, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> specific niche in portraying [...] "poorly informed, high-status idiot" [...] characters. Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a closeted homosexual, was having a [...] "secret" [...] affair with fellow teacher Geoffrey Jellineck, despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's Daily Show and Colbert Report character.|$|E

He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon... <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's {{going to be hard for}} [...] to keep up." ...|$|E

500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a [...] "chameleon" [...] and very charismatic. He continued: [...] "On the facade, {{he seems to have}} it all. He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's one of the first keyholders at the Playboy Club, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> mysterious past." [...] Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, [...] "Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's going to take to really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has." ...|$|E

[...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> pleasing fancy and a delightful sense of style; and his graceful draughtsmanship, his exquisite feeling for delicate harmonies of colour, and his brilliantly direct and expressive brushwork make his productions more than ordinarily important as examples of the judicious application of the water-colour medium.
