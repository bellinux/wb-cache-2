40|$|Many {{previous}} techniques <b>identify</b> <b>trending</b> {{topics in}} social me-dia, even topics {{that are not}} pre-defined. We present a technique to <b>identify</b> <b>trending</b> rumors, which we define as topics that include disputed factual claims. Putting aside any attempt to assess whether the rumors are true or false, it is valuable to <b>identify</b> <b>trending</b> ru-mors as early as possible. It {{is extremely difficult to}} accurately classify whether every in-dividual post is or is not making a disputed factual claim. We are able to <b>identify</b> <b>trending</b> rumors by recasting the problem as finding entire clusters of posts whose topic is a disputed factual claim. The key insight is that when there is a rumor, even though most posts do not raise questions about it, there may be a few that do. If we can find signature text phrases that are used by a few people to express skepticism about factual claims and are rarely used t...|$|R

25|$|Despite this vulnerability, {{the history}} of drought and famine in the Sahel do not {{perfectly}} correlate. While modern scientific climate and rainfall studies {{have been able to}} <b>identify</b> <b>trends</b> and even specific periods of drought in the region, oral and written records over the last millennium do not record famine in all places at all times of drought. One 1997 study, in attempting to map long scale rainfall records to historical accounts of famine in Northern Nigeria, concluded that “the most disruptive historical famines occurred when the cumulative deficit of rainfall fell below 1.3 times the standard deviation of long-term mean annual rainfall for a particular place.” The 1982 to 1984 period, for instance, was particularly destructive to the pastoral Fula people of Senegal, Mali and Niger, and the Tuareg of northern Mali and Niger. The populations had not only suffered in the 1968 to 1974 period, but the inability of many to rebuild herds destroyed a decade earlier, along with factors as various as the shift of political power to settled populations with independence in the 1960s, Senegalese-Mauritanian border relations, and Niger's dependence upon falling world uranium prices coinciding in a destructive famine.|$|E

40|$|Background: The authors {{tentatively}} {{believe they}} have <b>identified</b> a new <b>trend</b> within branding, where an established brand launches a new and innovative product that is somehow related to the brand’s core values, interactively through a complementary marketing communication video. Support for the relevance to further investigate the <b>identified</b> <b>trend</b> {{can be found in}} academic literature. Due to today’s competitive marketplace, several researchers emphasize the importance to further explore and evaluate creative customer-based brand equity-building strategies. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore the <b>identified</b> <b>trend</b> and whether this <b>identified</b> <b>trend</b> can assist in building customer- based brand equity. The authors of this thesis use the Volvo LifePaint campaign as a case for the study. The research questions concerns what associations consumers make to the launched product when being exposed to its complementary marketing communication video, and whether these associations are transferable to the brand. Method: The method of this research was qualitative and the primary data collection was collected through 10 semi-structured interviews, as well as observations through netnography. Conclusion: Based on the findings from the case study, the authors conclude that the <b>identified</b> <b>trend</b> may serve as a creative branding strategy for an established brand, to assist in building customer-based brand equity. However, the authors noticed that unfavorable associations also may be created and transferred, which potentially can harm the brand. ...|$|R
