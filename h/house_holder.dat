ABSTRACT: Storage fungi damage grains in several ways: they reduce germinability, produce undesirable odour and kernel discoloration, reduce the nutritional value and also produce mycotoxins injurious {{to the health of}} the consumers. A study was conducted to assess the prevalence of fungi associated with stored wheat grains under the storage conditions of farmers in Shashemene and Arsi Nagelle districts from June to July, 2013. Stratified random sampling technique was used to collect wheat grains from the study sites of Arsi Nagelle and Shashemene districts. Two peasant associations from each district and 10 <b>House</b> <b>Holders</b> from each of the peasant associations, with a total of 40 <b>House</b> <b>Holders</b> were purposively drawn for sample collection. A Malt Extract and Potato Dextrose Agar were used for the isolation of fungi. Fungi were identified based on the microscopic examination of spore morphology and culture characteristics of the isolates. A total of 898 fungal isolates belonging to five genera and three unidentified taxa were obtained. The isolated mycoflora were dominated by the morphotaxa of Aspergillus (45. 54 %) and Penicillium (29. 18 %), respectively. It was concluded that stored wheat from the study areas could be contaminated by storage fungi and therefore, awareness creation and training should be given to th...|$|R

50|$|Lord Siva is {{regarded}} limitless, transcendent, unchanging and formless. Lord Siva has many benevolent and fearsome forms. In benevolent aspects, Lord Siva {{is depicted as}} an omniscient yogi who lives an aesthetic life on Mount Kailash {{as well as a}} <b>house</b> <b>holder</b> with wife Sri Parvathi and their two children Lord Ganesha and Lord Kartikeya. Sri Prvathi is the ideal wife, mother and householder. The vision of ideal couple is derived from Lord Siva and Sri Parvathi as one being the better half of other. There is no separate existence for Lord Shiva or Sri Parvati. They are inseparable. The composite form of Lord Siva and Sri Parvathi conveys the unity of opposites in the universe. Lord Siva stands for Purusha and Sri Parvathi stands for Prakriti. Purusha is the male principle and passive force of the universe, while Prakriti is the female active force. The union of Purusha(Shiva) and Prakriti(Siva’s energy, Shakthi) is behind the entire creation in the universe. Hence devotees come at Maheswaram Sri Sivaparvati Temple to pray to Sri Sivaparvati for the auspiciousness of their family in all aspects.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} two novel semi-blind channel {{estimation}} techniques based on QR decomposition for Rayleigh flat fading Multiple Input Multiple output (MIMO) channel using various pilot symbols.

The matrix R is estimated blindly from only received data by using orthogonal matrix triangularization based <b>house</b> <b>holder</b> QR decomposition, while the optimum rotation matrix Q is estimated exclusively from pilot based Orthogonal Pilot Maximum Likelihood Estimator (OPML) algorithm.

40|$|Abstract — The present paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by constructing a web platform that integrates monitoring and management capabilities for {{a large number of}} home automation sensors. In the Internet of Things domain, it is possible to control remotely the sensors and their actuators, in order to assist (or substitute) the <b>house</b> <b>holder</b> in the management of home sensors. The platform has been applied in houses located in the rural village of Verrua Savoia, in North-Western Italy. Verrua Savoia is a Municipality that covers a territory of about 16 square kilometers, with approximately 1400 inhabitants, and half of the population aging more than sixty-five years old. The economical background is formed by small factories, few family-run shops, a couple of restaurants and bars. Most of the working people are commuters. For the rest, the economy is mainly agricultural, devoted to family needs. In such a context, the platform has been used to monitor the home temperature, and consequently to control the heating/cooling equipment, to monitor the humidity in the terrain, and consequently to control the garden watering facilities, to monitor the gas and water leakages, and consequently to control the activation of alarms. All sensors have been consequently interfaced to the Internet, either by wireless devices compliant to the IEEE 802. 11 standards, or by Ethernet devices. I...|$|E

50|$|Original block {{sizes were}} generous in Turner, ranging from around 800 m2 to 1400 m2, with some even {{reaching}} 1600 m2. 900-1000 m2 is typical. In {{the postwar period}} when resources were scarce, disproportionately small houses were built on these large blocks that are now inner city. This has made Turner blocks well suited for redevelopment, whether it be for units, townhouses, dual occupancies or occasional luxury houses. It was quite usual with the original buildings to have tiny three bedroom and even two bedroom houses on the blocks with floor areas of around 85 m2 - 110 m2. These houses were not only small but typically had tiny windows and were poorly positioned on the block for solar access - an important consideration in Canberra's cold climate. Houses were typically positioned for aesthetic effect with various ideas like inner-corner semi-detached (Hackett Gardens), facing the corner (Macleay Street) or symmetrical arrangements between the <b>houses</b> (<b>Holder</b> Street).|$|R

As Langley Green was walking distance to the new factory estate, many of the factory workers brought down from London with firms such as APV settled here.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study 1036 pregnant women were selected from health centers of urban areas in Qom.

The data analysis was performed by SPSS software program. X 2 test was used to determine the significance of differences (p< 0 / 05). Results: Calorie intake of 50 % of subjects was adequate.
