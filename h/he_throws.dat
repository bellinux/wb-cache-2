5|$|Clippard {{primarily}} {{throws a}} fastball and a changeup. His hard, straight four-seam fastball averages about , topping out at , and {{sets up a}} deceptive changeup in the high 70s to low 80s. Periodically, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> a cutter early in the count to right-handed hitters and a curveball in the mid 70s. Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success comes from his curveball and changeup.|$|E
5|$|Zoe visits her {{old school}} with Sarah and Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), recalling her {{relationship}} with her former teacher. She and Sarah get drunk and sleep together, which they both regret and agree to keep quiet.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who {{had been}} fired in the {{previous}} episode, auditions for The Next Great A Cappella Sensation. However, before {{he is able to}} try out, the judges close the auditions, sending home the remaining applicants, who have been standing in line for hours. Refusing to accept this, he bolts past security and argues with the judges to let him audition. When they refuse, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> a crying tantrum. Later, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets his former office workers. All together, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS's Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> {{away the}} rubbish, and after having washed his nets clean of the dirt, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> {{them for the}} third time. But he only drew in stones, shells, and mud. He was almost in despair.|$|R
50|$|Spokane Shock quarterback Kyle Rowley {{was named}} the games MVP. He went 24 for 32 with 237 yards. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> nine {{touchdown}} passes without an interception and added another touchdown on the run. The nine touchdowns <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> for set an ArenaBowl record.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> fled, <b>throwing</b> {{the white}} bottle behind him, {{and it became}} a thicket of thorns. As a fox, she made her way through it. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> the blue bottle behind him, and trapped her in a river, but as a fox, she swam ashore. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> the red bottle behind, and she was trapped in fire. It burned her until she {{was no more than a}} mosquito.|$|R
5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> his slow curveball much more frequently than does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{separate}} from Marge and Lisa and attend a sumo match.

Consequently, the only money the family has left is a one-million yen bill, which Lisa loses in the wind after Homer created an origami crane from it.|$|E
5|$|Max {{leaves the}} house when Ray reappears and Tim accuses Ray of ruining his night. Lee and Ben {{make their way to}} the beach and share a kiss.

He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her. The next morning, they pack up their belongings and go to pick up Jude.|$|E
60|$|The Indian {{was digging}} {{in the sand and}} dust under the {{shelving}} wall. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> out an object that rang against the stone. It was a belt buckle. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> out old shrunken, withered boots. He came upon other things, and then he ceased to dig.|$|R

After Adam attempts to use information from the future for his own gain <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> Adam out of his time machine, the TARDIS. This was the first example of the Doctor forcing a companion to leave because of negative behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a spoilt child opening {{numerous}} Christmas presents including a toy train, a box full of kittens {{and a copy of}} Hey Venus! (which <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before we cut back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a {{repertoire}} of four pitches. <b>He</b> <b>throws</b> a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95mph; {{this is one of}} his main pitches. He also has a slider, a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs.|$|E

5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E

She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E

60|$|Then {{a sudden}} thought seemed to strike him, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> back his head, gave a short laugh {{as if he}} were pleased with this new thought, then turned, meeting Mistress de Chavasse's stern gaze {{squarely}} and fully. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> his hat down upon the steps and crossed his arms over his chest.|$|R

5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has been sitting on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E

Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions.
