5|$|<b>If</b> <b>two</b> {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, <b>if</b> <b>two</b> smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E

5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; <b>if</b> <b>two</b> people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim.

5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. <b>If</b> <b>two</b> disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft.

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and <b>if</b> <b>two</b> (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>two</b> {{cells of}} the same type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The {{conditions}} which trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>two</b> of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In the first family (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile <b>if</b> <b>two</b> kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. <b>If</b> <b>two</b> theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory.
