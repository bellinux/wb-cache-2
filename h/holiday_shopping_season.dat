[...] Beginning in late 1959, the Mint {{failed to provide}} enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing.

[...] Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver.

BBC Online's writer James Blake called the album [...] "more than decent" [...] and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, as it was released only eleven months before #1's. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell felt that it was a [...] "smart" [...] move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it [...] "has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined".

However the wrong balance of these elements can hinder the positive reactions of consumers especially during the <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> <b>shopping</b> where potentially sales are at the highest. This study employed a convenience sampling data collection method from 300 respondents in a selected shopping mall during the month of December 2013 to capture the consumer’s reaction to the mall’s atmosphere which were enhanced with festive decorations to help induce potential buying behaviour. Results were collated based on the analysis of four significant environmental variables which are interior settings, music, employee engagement and consumer density. The findings indicated that the effects of interior settings, music and employee engagement were found to be evident. Conversely, consumer density was found to elicit no effect on consumer behaviour. It was also noted that gender moderates the relationship between music and consumer behaviour. The implications of the results obtained are discussed along with the managerial implications, limitations and future research...|$|R
