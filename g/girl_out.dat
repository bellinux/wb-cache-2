5|$|Jane and Kingsley {{lived at}} Lemmons with Jane's mother and brother, two artist friends, and Kingsley's three children, {{including}} the novelist Martin Amis. Several of the family's novels were written at Lemmons: Kingsley's The Green Man (1969) and The Alteration (1976), Jane's Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> (1972) and Mr. Wrong (1975), and Martin's The Rachel Papers (1973) and Dead Babies (1975).|$|E

5|$|Returning to the {{character}} she fantasized about the most, the last book in the series, Beebo Brinker, published in 1962, was Bannon's prequel to Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out.</b> It follows Beebo around Greenwich Village ten years before she meets Laura in I Am a Woman. Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown into New York City to find a waiting friend in Jack, and to discover herself. She begins {{an affair with a}} famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life.|$|E

5|$|Hiding {{inside an}} oil field shack while police comb {{the area and}} set up roadblocks, Gil is {{discovered}} by young Suzy who offers to fetch him cookies. Hurrying back to her house, Suzy is caught hoarding cookies by her mother and is forced to reveal who they are for. While her mother calls the police, Suzy slips {{out of the door}} to return to Gil. Her mother chases after her into the oil field, and police cars soon arrive. Realizing Suzy is endangered by being with him, Gil carries the <b>girl</b> <b>out</b> of the shack into the sunlight where he lets her go. He soon transforms into the creature. In the ensuing police chase, Gil slaughters one of the officers and then climbs the stairs {{to the top of a}} tall natural gas tank, where the remaining officer chases after him. As Gil begins to strangle him, the officer shoots Gil in the neck. Mortally wounded, the mutated Gil falls several stories to his death while Buckell, Hoffman and a sobbing Ann watch in dismay.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, Quisling {{departed}} Norway {{to become}} an intelligence officer with the Norwegian delegation in Helsinki, a post that combined diplomacy and politics. In the autumn of 1921, Quisling left Norway once again, this time {{at the request of}} explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen, and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there. Highlighting the massive mismanagement of the area and the death toll of approximately ten thousand a day, Quisling produced a report that attracted aid and demonstrated his administrative skills, as well as his dogged determination to get what he wanted. On 21August, he married the Russian Alexandra Andreevna ("Asja") Voronina, the daughter of a peddler. Alexandra wrote in her memoirs that Quisling declared his love for her, but based on his letters home and investigations undertaken by his cousins, it appears that there was never any question of romantic involvement between the two. Quisling merely seemed to have wanted to lift the <b>girl</b> <b>out</b> of poverty by providing her with a Norwegian passport and financial security.|$|E
5|$|The Beebo Brinker Chronicles are six {{books in}} all, first {{published}} between 1957 and 1962. They featured four characters {{who appeared in}} at least three of the books in a chronological saga of coming to terms with their homosexuality and navigating their ways through gay and lesbian relationships. The first in the series, Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out,</b> was published in 1957, and became Gold Medal Books' second best-selling title of the year. Based on Bannon's own experiences, the plot involved a lesbian relationship between two sorority sisters in a fictional sorority at a fictional midwestern university. As was custom with pulp fiction novels, neither the cover art nor the title were {{under the control of the}} author. Both were approved by the publisher in order to be as suggestive and lurid as possible. The main character is Laura Landon, who realizes that she's in love with Beth, her older, more experienced roommate, a leader in the sorority.|$|E

5|$|The Little Mother is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars Marie Eline who goes to her mother's employer and asks for her mother's job after she dies. Her employer is an artist with a kind heart and though the girl does not do the chores well. One of the artists models plot against him makes false charges against him, leading to his arrest. The little girl follows them and learns that they were out to obtain {{a large amount of}} money to have the false case dropped. She reports it to the police and the artist is freed, whereby he adopts the <b>girl</b> <b>out</b> of gratitude. Released on February 28, 1911, the film received mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, or leaving the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
25|$|A {{procession}} {{of all the}} men and boys, even carrying male infants, accompanied the <b>girl</b> <b>out</b> of the village to the scaffold. Together they awaited the morning star. When the star was due to rise, the girl was placed and tied on the scaffold. At the moment the star appeared above the horizon, the girl was shot with an arrow, then the priest cut the skin of her chest to bleed. She was quickly shot with arrows by all the participating men and boys to hasten her death. The girl was carried {{to the east and}} placed face down so her blood would soak into the earth, with appropriate prayers for the crops and life she would bring to all life on the prairie.|$|E

25|$|One {{of those}} 'big names' {{listening}} was Bruce Flohr, a top-level A rep for RCA Records and newly established ATO Records (known for introducing David Gray to American audiences). Upon meeting Jem, {{and listening to}} more of her demos, Flohr recalled thinking 'How do I not let this <b>girl</b> <b>out</b> the door without signing her?'. ATO Records quickly made the unanimous decision to offer her a recording contract. At that time {{there was no other}} label interest in her because her status as a studio only artist meant that she flew under the radar of most A She was subsequently signed to the label and on 13 October 2003 in preparation for the release of the full-length album, ATO released an extended play entitled, It All Starts Here..., consisting of five adapted demos that Jem had initially recorded. In anticipation of the album release, Jem also relocated to Los Angeles, where she felt there was more opportunity for her to promote her work and explore her musical potential.|$|E
500|$|Reacting to {{the renewed}} {{interest}} in the books, Bannon wrote in the 2002 introduction to Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> that she was shocked {{to find out that}} her characters were not only remembered but that they were archetypes among the lesbian community. The books are frequently on required reading lists for Women's and LGBT studies college courses. Bannon often admits to being surprised by this, explaining that she had no such aspirations when she was writing Odd Girl Out: [...] "If I had known, it might well have resulted in a much more polished product, but one that would have been so cautious and self-conscious as to be entirely forgettable. It would never—my best guess—have had the vibrant life it has now." ...|$|E

Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure is where my soul came from.

500|$|In Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out,</b> Laura Landon's {{resistance}} {{to the idea that}} she may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In I Am a Woman, the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance [...] "seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura", leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo in a moment of self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently. In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, Women in the Shadows, Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed. Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a man, if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a lesbian {{identity}} is also explored throughout Journey to a Woman, as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself {{at the end of}} the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent the anguish of self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in Women in the Shadows. Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain [...] "a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery". Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.|$|E

500|$|Her fourth {{book in the}} series, Journey to a Woman, {{published}} in 1960, again shows parallels between Bannon's own life and her plots. Beth, of Laura's affair in Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out,</b> is living {{with her husband and}} children in Southern California. She tries to find Laura again nine years after college, and escapes a deranged woman who has a fixation on her, a reflection of a relationship Bannon had with a beautiful, but [...] "very bewildered and unstable person." [...] Beth writes to an author of lesbian books in New York, and goes to meet her in hope of finding Laura. They have a brief relationship, after which Beth finds Laura married to Jack and with a child, then discovers Beebo as well. A fifth book, The Marriage, also {{published in}} 1960, again addresses issues of love outside the realm of socially acceptable relationships, although it is not primarily about homosexuality. In it, Jack and Laura are friends with a young married couple who discover they are brother and sister, and must decide whether they will stay together or conform to societal standards.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Bannon's {{work was}} {{included}} {{in a collection of}} authors who had made the deepest impact on the lives and identities of gays and lesbians, titled Particular Voices: Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers. In 2000, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors awarded Bannon a Certificate of Honor [...] "for breaking new ground with works like Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> and Women in the Shadows" [...] and for [...] "voic (ing) lesbian experiences at a time when explicit lesbian subject matter was silenced by government and communities." [...] In 2004, Bannon was elected into the Saints and Sinners Literary Festival Hall of Fame. She received the Sacramento State Alumni Association's Distinguished Faculty Award for 2005, and received the Trailblazer Award from the Golden Crown Literary Society the same year; the GCLS created the Ann Bannon GCLS Popular Choice Award. She was the recipient of the Alice B Award in 2008, that goes to authors whose careers have been distinguished by consistently well-written stories about lesbians. In May 2008, Bannon was given the Pioneer Award from the Lambda Literary Foundation.|$|E
500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd <b>Girl</b> <b>Out</b> with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E
