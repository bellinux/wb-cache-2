30|$|Although its {{application}} for instability {{did not have}} the lasting affect, use of plasma layer in chondroplasty was a novel method to treat cartilage lesions. Historically, these lesions were treated non-operatively, potentially leading to propagating fissures and further erosion of the cartilage (Vangsness Jr et al. 2004; Voloshin et al. 2007). The use on cartilage was found to have different physical and chemical properties as the probe tip creates a plasma layer through the conductive medium (Voloshin et al. 2007). The energy is converted to heat through molecular friction as the electrolytes in the solution oscillate (Meyer et al. 2005). As the collagen is heated, the triple helix of cartilage changes form. As it cools, the fibers realign in a fashion parallel to the joint (Piez 1984; Shellock and Shields Jr 2000). Additionally bipolar plasma layer has been found to have the added benefit of annealing which make the cartilage surface less permeable (Uthamanthil et al. 2006). The annealing process seals the passage of joint fluid enzymes into subchondral bone and maintain cartilaginous water content. This new layer may provide an impermeable surface that is more resilient to shear stresses commonly encountered in the knee, preventing <b>fissure</b> <b>propagation</b> (Gambardella et al. 2016), most helpful in treating grade 2 and 3 cartilage lesions.|$|E
40|$|THE ACCIDENTAL CONDITION PRODUCED BY A COOLANT PIPE BREAK INSIDE THE BREEDER UNIT HAS BEEN CHOSEN TO CONTROL THE CONTAINMENT AND PROTECTION CAPABILITIES OF A 17 LI 83 PB BREEDER BLANKET DESIGN. THE FIRST BARRIER AGAINST THE RADIOACTIVITY PROPAGATION IS THE VESSEL OF THE BREEDER UNIT WHICH HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN DETAIL. THE STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY HAS BEEN ASSESSED TO GENERALIZED PLASTIC COLLAPSE AND BRITTLE-DUCTILE <b>FISSURE</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b> MECHANISM ACCORDING TO THE ASME RULES AND THE TWO CRITERIA METHOD. ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SEVERAL UNKNOWNS (RADIATION DAMAGE ETC.) THIS BLANKET SHOWS A HIGH PRO- BABILITY OF SURVIVAL WITH REGARD TO THIS ACCIDENT. THE GENERAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN ADOPTED TO CONTROL EACH SOURCE OF HAZARD BY MEANS OF THREE "LINES OF DEFENCE" (CONTAINMENT BARRIERS + PROTECTION SYSTEM), TWO OF WHICH MUST BE OF TYPE "A" AND ONE OF TYPE "B", DEFINED AS : - TYPE "A" GUARANTEED FAILURE RATE OF LESS THAN 10 - 4 PER REQUEST, OBTAINED IF NECESSARY WITH REDUNDANCIES AND COUPLING OF VARIOUS PROTECTION SYSTEMS, - TYPE "B" : IN THESE SYSTEMS FAILURE RATES AS ABOVE CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. THE EVENT TREE OF THE ACCIDENT PROPAGATION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE LINES OF DEFENCE AND THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY. THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER LINE OF DEFENCE, REPRESENTED BY AN INTERMEDIATE CONTAINMENT BETWEEN THE TORUS AND THE REACTOR HALL IS GIVEN AS A DESIGN OPTION. NA-NOT AVAILABL...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{extensive}} applications in various {{fields such as}} science and engineering, fractional differential equations attract more and more attention of experts and scholars. Fractional differential equations may be derived from the particle sticking and trapping phenomena which would be more accurate to describe certain physical phenomena (see, for examples, [10 â€“ 12]). In addition, Sobolev-type equation appears {{in all kinds of}} physical problems such as flow of fluid through <b>fissured</b> rocks, thermodynamics, <b>propagation</b> of long waves of small amplitude (see [13]). Therefore, it is necessary and significative to study fractional order differential equations of Sobolev-type (see [14, 15] and the references therein). The existence and uniqueness of mild solution to Sobolev-type fractional nonlocal dynamical equations in Banach spaces is shown in [16]. By using the fractional calculus, semigroup theory and stochastic analysis techniques, [17] considered a class of nonlinear fractional Sobolev-type stochastic differential equations in a Hilbert space.|$|R
