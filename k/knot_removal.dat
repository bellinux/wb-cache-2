Obviously, this is not always possible while retaining the exact shape of the curve. In practice, a tolerance in the accuracy is used to determine whether a knot can be removed. The process is used to clean up after an interactive session in which control points may have been added manually, or after importinga curve from a different representation, where a straightforward conversion process leads to redundant control points.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{techniques}} for fitting generalized additive models mostly rely on basis expansions of covariates using {{a large number}} of basis functions and penalized estimation of parameters. For example, a mixed model approach is used to fit a model for children's lung function that allows for non-linear influence of several covariates available in a substantial data set. While the resulting model is expected to have good prediction performance, its handling beyond simple visual presentation is problematic. It is shown how the number basis functions of the underlying B-spline representation can be reduced by <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> techniques without refitting, while preserving the shape of the fitted functions. The condition for exact <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> is extended towards approximate <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> by incorporating the covariance matrix of the initial parameter estimates, resulting in considerable simplification of the model. Covariance matrices for the transformed parameter estimates are provided. It is demonstrated that enforcing the <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> condition during estimation leads to the difference penalties employed in the P-spline approach for estimation of B-spline coefficients, and therefore provides a further justification for this type of penalty. A final transform to a truncated power basis provides a simple equation for the model. This increases transportability, while retaining properties of the initial fit such as good prediction performance. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} and efficient wavelet construction for non-uniform B-spline curves and surfaces. The method allows to remove knots in arbitrary order minimizing {{the displacement of}} control points when a knot is re-inserted. Geometric detail subtracted from a shape by <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> is represented by an associated wavelet coefficient replacing one of the control points at a coarser level of detail. From the hierarchy of wavelet coefficients, perfect reconstruction of the original shape is obtained. Both <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> and insertion have local impact. Wavelet synthesis and analysis are both computed in linear time, based on the lifting scheme for biorthogonal wavelets. The method is perfectly suited for multiresolution surface editing, progressive transmission, and compression of spline curves and surfaces...|$|E

Just before incubation, the composition of waxes secreted by the uropygial gland of Red Knots and other sandpipers changes quickly and completely from a mixture of only monoesters to a mixture of only diesters. We hypothesized that the change in composition of the preen wax helps protect the plumage against feather-degrading bacteria. We tested the hypothesis by studying growth of the feather-degrading bacterium Bacillus licheniformis, which we found in the plumage of Red <b>Knots.</b> The <b>removal</b> of preen waxes from feathers resulted in faster bacterial degradation, confirming earlier findings that preen wax inhibits growth of feather-degrading bacteria. However, the degradation rate of feathers with preen wax based on diesters {{did not differ from}} that of feathers with preen wax based on monoesters. We suggest that preen waxes protect feathers by forming a physical barrier to microbes rather than through chemical properties of the waxes. ...|$|R

In Indian cooking, the leaf is added whole to biryani, a kind of rice pilaf, made with ordinary rice (as opposed to that made with the premium-grade Basmati rice). The basis for this use is that both Basmati and Pandan leaf contain the same aromatic flavoring ingredient, 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline.

Results for a small sample of six disk galaxies (NGC 1566, NGC 2976, NGC 3031, NGC 3184, NGC 4321, and NGC 5194) with a range of morphological properties, dust contents and star formation histories are presented to demonstrate our approach. We use an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) technique designed to separate statistically independent source distributions, maximizing the distinction in the [3. 6]-[4. 5] colors of the sources. The technique also removes emission from intermediate-age evolved red objects with a low mass-to-light ratio, such as asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars, revealing maps of the underlying old distribution of light with [3. 6]-[4. 5] colors consistent with the colors of K and M giants. Contaminants are identified via comparison to the non-stellar emission imaged at 8 microns, which is dominated by the broad PAH feature. Using the measured 3. 6 / 8 micron ratio to select the individual contaminants, we find that hot dust and PAH together contribute between ~ 5 - 15 % to the integrated light at 3. 6 microns, while light from regions dominated by intermediate-age stars accounts for only 1 - 5 %.

40|$|AbstractObjective: {{to review}} {{published}} reports on knotted intravascular devices/catheters. Method : report of two cases and systematic {{review of the}} literature. Results: a total of 113 reported cases of knotted intravascular devices/catheters were located. Pulmonary artery catheters (Swan–Ganz) were responsible {{for more than two}} thirds of the total reported intravascular knots. In 62 % (70 / 113) of the cases withdrawal of the knotted catheters was achieved successfully with different interventional radiological techniques, avoiding the need for surgical exploration. In 32 % (36 / 113) of the patients surgical removal was favoured. Capture with one of the interventional techniques and pulling down the knot into an easily accessible vein to be removed through an open venotomy, was the most common surgical procedure. However, in five cases, an open cardiotomy was required. In seven cases the patient's condition was critical and precluded any surgical procedure, so the knotted catheter was left in situ. The mortality of this event was 8 % (9 / 113). Conclusions: interventional radiological techniques have largely replaced open surgical <b>removal.</b> <b>Knotted</b> catheters may need to be surgically removed when (a) the knot is large in size with many loops, or (b) intracardiac fixing of the knot is encountered...|$|R

40|$|Subject of {{the work}} {{presented}} here is a flow-adaptive measurement grid algorithm developed for one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) flow field surveys with pneumatic probes in turbomachinery flows. The algorithm automatically determines the distribution {{and the amount of}} measurement points needed for an approximation of the pressure distribution within a predefined accuracy. All operations of the algorithm are based on transient measurements, which are conducted back and forth in one spatial direction within the measurement domain. The dynamic response of the pressure measuring system is disregarded during the traverses, which serve to detect changes in the pressure field. A correction to take account of the dynamic response of the pressure measuring system is implemented in the algorithm. The dynamic response is compensated by deconvolving the transient measurement data using the information embedded in both transient measurements. By deconvolution of the transient measurement data, the performance of the flow-adaptive algorithm becomes largely independent of the transient traversing speed and the geometry of the pressure measuring system. <b>Knot</b> insertion and <b>removal</b> strategies are incorporated in order to reduce measurement points and increase robustness toward differing flow field conditions. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated for 1 D and 2 D flow field surveys with a pneumatic five-hole probe in an annular cascade wind tunnel. The pressure distribution in the measurement domain is approximated within a predefined accuracy, based on the measurement uncertainty of the pressure transducers. The application of the algorithm shows a significant {{reduction in the number of}} measurement points. Compared to the uniform measurement grids, approximately 30 % fewer measurement points are required for 1 D and 20 % fewer points for 2 D flow field surveys with the identical spatial resolution. Consequently, measurement time is reduced by at least 19 % for 1 D measurements and by at least 7 % for 2 D measurements with the same spatial resolution...|$|R

Most of the work on scattered data approximation with radial basis functions has been in the Euclidean setting (see e. g. [4], and some references therein). On the sphere interpolation was treated e. g. in [1, 3, 7, 8]. So far there has been no discussion of the use of radial basis functions for approximation over the sphere.

40|$|In many {{settings}} with possibly non-linear {{influence of}} covariates, {{such as in}} the present application with children's respiratory health data, generalized additive models are an attractive choice. Although techniques for fitting these have been extensively investigated, there are fewer results on stability of replication, i. e. stability of fitted model components with respect to perturbations in the data. Nevertheless, this aspect is essential for judging how useful the present model is for understanding predictors of lung function. We therefore investigate existing tools for stability analysis based on bootstrap samples, such as quantities for variability and bias, for our application. Furthermore, as the focus is on models based on "B"-splines, <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> techniques are available. These can help to provide more insight into the stability of local features that are fitted in bootstrap samples. We analyse the bootstrap result matrix via log-linear models. Specifically, the relationship with respect to local features between the influence functions of potential lung function predictors is investigated.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for more intuitive methods for creating and modifying free-form curves and surfaces in CAD modeling systems. The methods should be based {{not only on the}} change of the mathematical parameters, such as control points, knots, and weights, but also on the user's specified constraints and shapes. This paper presents a new approach for directly manipulating the shape of a free-form curve, leading to a better control of the curve deformation and a more intuitive CAD modeling interface. The user's intended deformation of a curve is automatically converted into the modification of the corresponding NURBS control points and knot sequence of the curve. The algorithm for this approach includes curve elevation, knot refinement, control point repositioning, and <b>knot</b> <b>removal.</b> Several examples shown in this paper demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to deform a NURBS curve into the desired shape.

40|$|Suppose we {{are given}} noisy data which are {{considered}} to be perturbed values of a smooth, univariate function. In order to approximate these data in the least squares sense, a linear combination of B-splines is used where the tradeoff between smoothness and closeness of the fit is controlled by a smoothing term which regularizes the least squares problem and guarantees unique solvability independent of the position of knots. Moreover, a subset of the knot sequence which defines the B-splines, the so-called free knots, is included in the optimization process. The resulting constrained least squares problem which is linear in the spline coefficients but nonlinear in the free knots is reduced to a problem that has only the free knots as variables. The reduced problem is solved by a generalized Gauss-Newton method.

40|$|Precise {{curve fitting}} is an {{important}} feature of many computer applications, from statistical analysis cools, co the editors used by font and graphic designers, co the sophisticated computer-aided design/manufacturing environments developed for engineering systems. B-splines are {{the most widely used}} curve forms in such applications; composed of piecewise parametric cubic segments, they are notable for their compact representation, computational efficiency and, in particular, the high degree of continuity they enforce between successive curve segments. Such continuity, however, inhibits the freedom with which local, finer resolution editing may be performed on these curves. Refinement is most directly accomplished by inserting knots into the curve, subdividing the curve into a larger number of segments. Mulciresolution analysis, a form of data analysis based on the use of wavelets, offers a means of determining a unique such subdivision of a given curve. The application of this process is also reversible so chat curve smooching or <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> operations may be performed with the same economy as refinement operations. Furthermore, the special computational properties of wavelets guarantee chat such shifts of resolution may be performed in time linear with the size of the curve, suggesting chat editing operations on a curve, at a variety of resolutions, may be done at interactive speeds...|$|E

In the past decade, a lot of research work has been focused on the problem of degree reduction of B-spline curves[1 ~ 4]. However, the research is concerned with how good the approximation is; none of it deals with the numerical gaps.

40|$|Non-uniform {{rational}} basis spline (NURBS) is a geometric language {{which has}} been commonly used in computer graphics and Computer Aided Design over years, due to its great flexibility and precision for handling modeled shapes. In computer-aided design, NURBS {{has become part of}} industry standards. In most CAD programs every solid model is described by NURBS and stored in NURBS data structure. Recently, the geometric basis function of NURBS is directly used in analysis, leading to the birth of a new area of computational mechanics called isogeometric analysis (IGA). Compared with the traditional finite element analysis, IGA eliminates the disconnection between analysis and design at the geometric level, showing superiority on efficiency and accuracy over the traditional finite element method. This thesis focuses on the development of an IGA preprocessor for converting an original CAD model (2 D-NURBS model) to an ASG (analysis suited geometry) model. ASG means models with mesh quality suitable for analysis. Core technologies utilized during the development include the well-developed NURBS algorithm of knot insertion and <b>knot</b> <b>removal,</b> and a self-developed technology of constructing and utilizing “multi-patch tree”.

Our approach seeks to bring the expressiveness of real-time motion capture systems into a general-purpose multi-track system running on a graphics workstation. We emphasize the use of high-bandwidth interaction with 3 D objects together with specific data reduction techniques for the automatic construction of editable representations of interactively sketched continuous parameter evolution. In this paper, we concentrate on providing {{a solution to the}} problem of applying data reduction techniques in an animation context. The requirements that must be fulfilled by the data reduction algorithm are analyzed. From the Lyche and Moerken <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> strategy, we derive an incremental algorithm that computes a B-spline approximation to the original curve by considering only a small piece of the total curve at any time. This algorithm allows the processing of the user's captured motion in parallel with its specification, and guarantees constant latency time and memory needs for input motions composed of any number of samples. After showing the results obtained by applying our incremental algorithm to 3 D animation paths, we describe an integrated environment to visually construct 3 D animations, where all interaction is done directly in three dimensions. By recording the effects of user's manipulations and taking into account the temporal aspect of the interaction, straight-ahead animations can be defined.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} an adjustable suture (AS) experimental model {{that allows for}} tightening, loosening and retightening of the suture tension in trabeculectomy. METHODS: Standard trabeculectomy was performed in fifteen pig eyeballs. All pig eyes were tested twice: one test with conventional suture in both flap's corners (conventional suture group) and another test with a conventional suture at one corner and an adjustable suture in the other corner (AS group). The order in which each test was performed was defined by randomization. Intraocular pressure was measured at three time points: T 1) when the knots were tightened; T 2) when the AS was loosened or the conventional knot was removed; and T 3) when the AS was retightened in the AS group or five minutes after the <b>knot</b> <b>removal</b> in the conventional suture group. RESULTS: The mean Intraocular pressure was similar {{between the two groups}} at time point 1 (p= 0. 97). However, significant Intraocular pressure differences were found between eyes in the conventional and adjustable suture groups at time points 2 (12. 6 ± 4. 2 vs 16. 3 ± 2. 3 cmH 2 O, respectively, p= 0. 006) and 3 (12. 2 ± 4. 0 vs 26. 4 ± 1. 7 cmH 2 O, respectively; p= 0. 001). While the conventional technique allowed only Intraocular pressure reduction (following the knot removal; T 2 and T 3), the AS technique allowed both Intraocular pressure reduction (T 2) and elevation (T 3) through the management (loosening and retightening) of the suture.
