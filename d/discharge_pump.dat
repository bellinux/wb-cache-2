We have analyzed five samples,of mine discharge for ferrous iron, total iron, aluminum, manganese, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, sulfate, silica, and pH. Selected trace elements were sought {{in two of the}} five samples chosen because of their extreme values in pH (3. 2 and 7. 4). Four of the samples may be considered "acid mine drainage " so characterized by pH of from 3. 2 to 5. 5, total iron in excess of 500 ppm, and aluminum greater than 100 ppm in the more acid samples.

Similar distinctions in composition are reflected in trace elements of the two extreme samples. The marked differences in the neutral sample and the acid samples are evidence for the efficacy of minimizing contact of water with the un-derground workings.

Briefly, the system consists of a balance tank, product pumps, magnetic flow meters, temperature transmitters, level transmitters, tubular heat exchanger with raw regenerator, heater, hold tube, MST chamber, pasteurized regenerator, and cooler sections. The system is started up on water, then sanitized by circulating water at 98  °C for 20  min. After sanitization, the system is cooled down and controlled at the desired operating temperatures for the experiment. The system is equipped with: regenerator bypass on the raw regenerator to allow {{for control of the}} temperature out of the regenerator and cascade hot water to heater product out temperature control to control the feed temperature to the MST inlet. The product is then fed to the inlet nozzle or nozzles of the MST chamber at a controlled pressure (pressure =  800, 000  Pa). Milk droplets are sprayed into the unit, at which time the milk is then heated to temperature within 0.02  s, which establishes the desired effect. The internal temperature of the MST unit is controlled by the cascade temperature control of hot water to internal temperature. This temperature is controlled at a value 10  °C higher than the inlet temperature. The lower jacket is cooled to prevent further heat treatment of the droplets collecting {{on the bottom of the}} MST Chamber. The <b>discharge</b> <b>pump</b> from the MST chamber controls a minimum level in the discharge leg of the MST chamber, and acts as the motive force to push through the downstream pasteurized regenerator and cooling sections of the process, and finally discharged to the destination.

40|$|The Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is in {{the process}} of closing two {{underground}} high-level waste (HLW) storage tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations and Department of Energy orders. Closure of these two tanks is scheduled for 2004 as the first phase in closure of the eleven 1. 14 million liter (300, 000 gallon) tanks currently in service at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). The INTEC Tank Farm Facility (TFF) Closure sequence consists of multiple steps to be accomplished through the existing tank riser access points. Currently, the tank risers contain steam and process waste lines associated with the steam jets, corrosion coupons, and liquid level indicators. As necessary, this equipment will be removed from the risers to allow adequate space for closure equipment and activities. The basic tank closure sequence is as follows: Empty the tank to the residual heel using the existing jets; Video and sample the heel; Replace steam jets with new jet at a lower position in the tank, and remove additional material; Flush tank, piping and secondary containment with demineralized water; Video and sample the heel; Evaluate decontamination effectiveness; Displace the residual heel with multiple placements of grout; and Grout piping, vaults and remaining tank volume. Design, development, and deployment of a remotely operated tank cleaning system were completed in June 2002. The system incorporates many commercially available components, which have been adapted for application in cleaning high-level waste tanks. The system is cost-effective since it also utilizes existing waste transfer technology (steam jets), to remove tank heel solids from the tank bottoms during the cleaning operations. Remotely operated directional spray nozzles, automatic rotating wash balls, video monitoring equipment, decontamination spray-rings, and tank -specific access interface devices have been integrated to provide a system that efficiently cleans tank walls and heel solids in an acidic, radioactive environment. Through the deployment of the tank cleaning system, the INEEL High Level Waste Program has cleaned tanks to meet RCRA clean closure standards and DOE closure performance measures. Design, development, and testing of tank grouting delivery equipment were completed in October 2002. The system incorporates lessons learned from closures at other DOE facilities. The grout will be used to displace the tank residuals remaining after the cleaning is complete. To maximize heel displacement to the <b>discharge</b> <b>pump,</b> grout was placed in a sequence of five positions utilizing two riser locations.

40|$|As the {{industry}} seeks out exploration prospects in increasing water depths, {{the complexity of}} drilling in tight pore-pressure and fracture-pressure windows has become progressively more challenging. Conventional or single-gradient drilling has reached a physical limitation where the formation can no longer tolerate the hydrostatic pressure from a single column of drilling fluid. Narrow pressure windows require additional casing strings, which, when used with conventional drilling technology, complicates reaching geological targets. There are numerous methods of dual-gradient drilling (DGD) ? a subset of managed pressure drilling (MPD) ? but each share the same principal. In each method, DGD seeks to eliminate {{the problems associated with}} water depth, as DGD closely matches the natural pressure gradient of the water depth. Dual-gradient refers to the ability to adjust two distinct fluid densities by controlling the annular pressure. Therefore, we can manage the effect of equivalent circulating density (ECD) in an effort to maintain bottomhole pressure (BHP) within a narrow operating window between pore pressure and fracture pressure. Therefore, DGD permits longer hole sections and less casing strings in comparison to conventional technology. In a sense, DGD allows development of wells that were at one time considered ?un-drillable?. We will focus on Statoil?s Controlled Mud Pressure field trial using Enhanced Drilling?s DGD technology (EC-Drill?) in the Troll field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The EC-Drill? system is comprised of a subsea pump module (SPM) attached to a marine riser that pumps returns to a discrete mud return line. This system relies on a partially evacuated riser made up of a blanket fluid of air and heavier drilling mud. The riser mud level can be influenced by adjusting the <b>discharge</b> <b>pump</b> rate of the SPM, that when run in automatic mode, the system will maintain constant bottomhole pressure. In contrast, the SPM can be operated in manual mode where a constant riser fluid level is maintained instead ?termed ?controlled mud level? (CML). The objective of this research study was to perform simulation on transient behavior during a connection break using Schlumberger software, Drillbench?. Connections made during conventional drilling are potentially precarious times to encounter well kicks due to the loss of annular friction, effectively reducing the BHP down to a static mud weight. In contrast, this research aims to highlight the efficacy of the EC-Drill? system where the SPM remains circulating during connections, addressing both the U-tubing and loss of annular frictional pressure loss. The simulation software presented an in-depth understanding of the dynamic hydraulics with the capability of reproducing field trials with a level of accuracy that is not obtainable with other competitive steady-state models. Results demonstrate that constant BHP can be simulated within a +/- 50 -psi window, while responding to changes in drilling parameters and navigating tight formation/fracture gradient windows with a full-riser margin. This research required close collaboration with three primary partners ? Statoil ASA?, AGR Enhanced Drilling?, and Schlumberger Ltd?...|$|E
