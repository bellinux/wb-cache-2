50|$|Frappé coffee (also Greek frappé or café frappé φραπές, frapés) is a Greek foam-covered iced coffee drink {{made from}} instant coffee (generally, spray-dried Nescafe), water and sugar.

Frappé has been marketed chiefly by Nestlé in Greece and is among the most popular drinks in Greece and Cyprus, and is available at virtually all Greek cafés. The word frappé is French and comes from the verb frapper which means to 'strike'; in this context, however, in French, when describing a drink, the word frappé means chilled, as with ice cubes in a shaker. The frappé has become a hallmark of post-war outdoor <b>Greek</b> <b>coffee</b> culture.|$|E
50|$|Destruction is self-obsessed in {{the most}} {{positive}} sense of that term; after giving up his responsibilities he concentrates instead on attempting to learn about his own nature and exert control over it. This is manifested in his deliberate attempt to subvert his own essential nature and create instead of destroy; he is shown at various points writing indifferent poetry, painting an indifferent picture, cooking a meal left untouched by those for whom it was intended, and brewing <b>Greek</b> <b>coffee</b> which Delirium fails to drink properly. Several characters refer to him as being a horrible artist. It's likely that Destruction is inspired by Death's suggestion that everyone can know everything. He tells Dream in Brief Lives that each Endless is really a lord of opposites: life and death, dreams and reality, destruction and creation, destiny and freedom, etc.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, [...] "frappe" [...] has two meanings, {{only one}} related to coffee, and neither {{connected}} to the <b>Greek</b> <b>coffee</b> drink.

5000|$|Spoon sweets (γλυκό του κουταλιού glykó tou koutalioú 'sweet of the spoon') {{are popular}} in Greece and Cyprus, usually served with <b>Greek</b> <b>coffee</b> {{and a glass}} of cold water. Most are made of whole fruit, though some kinds are made of pieces or purees.One {{typically}} Greek spoon sweet is the snow-white and intensely aromatic vaníllia (βανίλια, va'nilja) which is not made of vanilla, but of mastic resin, for which the Aegean island of Chios is famous. This is usually served as a spoonful of sweet on a table spoon dropped into a tall glass of ice-cold water and popularly called [...] "βανίλια υποβρύχιο", a [...] "vanilla submarine". It is a thick, white, sweet paste made industrially by beating mastic resin with table sugar. When cold, it has the consistency of hard caramel candy: it is meant to be licked like a lollipop as, at body temperature, it gradually becomes softer and more chewable. The Greek diaspora introduced this treat to other countries as far away as Japan. It is regarded as the official sweet of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGreek {{coffee is}} a {{traditional}} product of superior aroma and flavor. Changes of aroma volatile compounds of ground roasted coffee can occur during storage, leading to “coffee staling” which affects the quality and acceptability of the brew. Temperature and water activity effect quality especially during home storage, after opening of the vacuum pack (secondary shelf-life). The objective was to define volatile indices of <b>greek</b> <b>coffee</b> quality and model their change {{as a function of}} temperature and water activity during storage. <b>Greek</b> <b>coffee</b> samples were equilibrated at constant water activities aw (0. 15, 0. 22, 0. 33, 0. 52) and stored at constant temperatures (25, 35, 45 °C). The profile of volatile compounds was obtained directly from ground coffee samples using purge and trap-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methodology. Furfural was considered to be a good aroma marker of <b>greek</b> <b>coffee</b> staling during storage; furfural changes (expressed by coffee aroma loss rate constants, kvol) were well correlated to storage temperature T and aw. Increase of water activity (for aw values above 0. 33) and increase of storage temperature (from 25 to 45 °C) caused decrease of shelf life estimated based on aroma indices for <b>greek</b> <b>coffee.</b> The shelf life for coffee samples of aw 0. 52 stored at temperatures 25 and 45 °C was found to be 82 - 92 and 20 - 23 days, respectively. At 45 °C, aw decrease from 0. 52 to 0. 33 led to shelf life increase from 20 - 23 to 36 - 41 days. Additionally, coffee aroma loss was expressed based on sensory evaluation (scores for aroma intensity and overall impression, 1 - 9). Rate constants for coffee aroma loss based on sensory scoring of coffee brews were calculated (ksens). A comprehensive mathematical model of 3 parameters that describes the effects of storage temperature and water activity on kvol and ksens was developed allowing the calculation of shelf life (SL) for <b>greek</b> <b>coffee</b> during (home) storage...|$|E
