50|$|It is {{difficult}} to relate wetlands maps to rainfall amounts recorded at different points such as airports, television stations, and schools. A GIS, however, {{can be used to}} depict two- and three-dimensional characteristics of the Earth's surface, subsurface, and atmosphere from information points. For example, a GIS can quickly generate a map with isopleth or contour lines that indicate differing amounts of rainfall. Such a map {{can be thought of as}} a rainfall contour map. Many sophisticated methods can estimate the characteristics of surfaces from a limited number of point measurements. A two-dimensional contour map created from the surface modeling of rainfall point measurements may be overlaid and analyzed with any other map in a GIS covering the same area. This GIS <b>derived</b> <b>map</b> can then provide additional information - such as the viability of water power potential as a renewable energy source. Similarly, GIS can be used to compare other renewable energy resources to find the best geographic potential for a region.|$|E

40|$|Temporomandibular {{disorders}} (TMDs) are {{a common}} group of chronic disorders (illnesses) that health care providers can find difficult to diagnose and explain. Similar difficulties in the diagnosis of other chronic conditions {{have been shown to}} {{have a negative impact on}} health. An understanding of TMD patients’ experiences and journey through care could indicate time points and strategies to help patients. Objective:  To develop a robust empirically <b>derived</b> <b>map</b> of TMD sufferers’ journey through care. Methods:  A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was undertaken using a purposive sample of patients with TMDs. Analysis followed the principles of the constant comparative method where data collection and thematic analysis occurred concurrently and continued until data saturation (n = 29). Results:  The experiences of patients could be grouped into three key stages: genesis of problem, seeking help in primary care and secondary care intervention. A wide variety of negative effects were described throughout these stages. An empirically <b>derived</b> <b>map</b> of the patients’ reported journey through care emerged. Conclusions:  The experiences of patients with TMDs mirror experiences of other types of chronic illness. Mapping the journey through care for TMDs highlights the potential for interaction between the stages of the journey and the individual’s illness. It may be possible to target interventions at specific stages on the map to help minimize the psychosocial effects of TMDs...|$|E

The notion of a principal <b>derived</b> <b>map</b> is already fairly well {{understood in terms of}} the defining voltages; however, once it is recognized that voltages are essentially cohomological in nature, the functorial interplay among homology provides a very tractible methodology for studying such properties as connectivity or regularity of the covering, or for obtaining explicit constructions of the voltages affording the given covering map...|$|E

In addition, the genomes of a variety of thermophilic Methanobacterium strains were treated with restriction enzymes and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.

40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{creation}} of river basin plans and programmes of measures according to the EU Water Framework Directive, the importance of model-supported analyses of nutrient inputs into aquatic systems and the localization of source areas is increasing. Especially in lowland regions artificial drainage installations play a major role, but little information exists concerning their location within larger river basins. Therefore, artificially drained lands were identified by interpreting aerial photographs and typical site conditions of the drained plots were derived. A GIS-based approach was then developed, which allows the delineation of artificially drained lands by combining various site conditions like soil properties and land use type. After checking the validity of a <b>derived</b> <b>map</b> for the River Ems basin (12 940 km(2)) With small-scale drainage installation maps, the approach was applied to northwestern Germany (98 000 km(2)).

40|$|Land-use change {{models are}} useful tools for {{assessing}} and comparing {{the environmental impact}} of alternative policy scenarios. Their increasing popularity as spatial planning instruments also poses new scientific challenges, such as correctly calibrating the model. The challenge in model calibration is twofold: obtaining a reliable and consistent time series of land-use information and finding suitable measures to compare model output to reality. Both of these issues are addressed in this paper.
