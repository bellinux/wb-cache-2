5|$|The quarry {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and industrial archaeology. Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock <b>facies,</b> and study changes in vertical and lateral <b>facies.</b> The <b>facies</b> are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. The quarry could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E
5|$|The Ediacara-type {{assemblage}} {{is named}} after Australia's Ediacara Hills, and consists of fossils preserved in <b>facies</b> of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate. Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths, but a few are preserved within sandy units.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus have been {{recovered}} from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay <b>Facies</b> (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus.|$|E
5|$|Nemegt sediments {{preserve}} large river {{channels and}} soil deposits that indicate {{a far more}} humid climate than those suggested by the underlying Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers. The rock <b>facies</b> of this formation suggest the presence of mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine <b>facies</b> of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E
5|$|S. angustirostris {{was one of}} {{the largest}} herbivores of the Nemegt Formation, which lacked large horned dinosaurs, but had sauropods and a more diverse {{theropod}} fauna. It coexisted with the rare hadrosaurid Barsboldia, flat-headed pachycephalosaurian Homalocephale and domed Prenocephale, the large ankylosaurid Saichania, rare saltasaurid sauropods Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia, the alvarezsaurid Mononykus, three types of troodontids including Zanabazar, several oviraptorosaurians including Rinchenia and Nomingia, the ostrich-mimics Gallimimus and Deinocheirus, therizinosaurid Therizinosaurus, tyrannosaurid relative Bagaraatan, and the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus. Unlike other Mongolian formations like the well-known Djadochta Formation that includes Velociraptor and Protoceratops, the Nemegt is interpreted as being well-watered, like the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. When examined, the rock <b>facies</b> of the Nemegt formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that a rich habitat existed, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain Cretaceous dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{is exposed}} over the {{southern}} {{slope of the}} North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle <b>facies</b> association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes {{that have been found}} belong to the families Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented with Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.|$|E
5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms {{the floor of the}} lower Everglades. The Miami Limestone is made up of ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain of sand. The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite, which comprises <b>facies</b> of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some of the first material used in housing in early 20th-century South Florida. The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|E
5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock <b>facies</b> of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} in which coastlines move {{in the direction of}} the continent is called transgression. In the case of transgression, deeper marine <b>facies</b> are deposited over shallower <b>facies,</b> a succession called onlap. Regression is the {{situation in}} which a coastline moves {{in the direction of the}} sea. With regression, shallower <b>facies</b> are deposited on top of deeper <b>facies,</b> a situation called offlap.|$|E
25|$|<b>Facies</b> can be {{distinguished}} {{in a number of}} ways: the most common are by the lithology (for example: limestone, siltstone or sandstone) or by fossil content. Coral for example only lives in warm and shallow marine environments and fossils of coral are thus typical for shallow marine <b>facies.</b> <b>Facies</b> determined by lithology are called lithofacies; <b>facies</b> determined by fossils are biofacies.|$|E
25|$|Attappadi {{is unique}} in {{that a number of}} rock types varying in {{composition}} from ultramafic to metapelites occur as supracrustals. The metapelites are of granulite <b>facies</b> and the ultramafics are of greenschist <b>facies</b> and the enclosing gneisses represent amphibolites <b>facies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prograde {{metamorphism}} {{to either}} greenschist <b>facies</b> or amphibolite <b>facies</b> tends to revert igneous olivine to metamorphic olivine, serpentinite or talc carbonated ultramafic schists.|$|E
25|$|In the Shakespeare {{quadrangle}}, only a lineated <b>facies</b> of the Van Eyck Formation is recognized, {{whereas in}} the Tolstoj quadrangle to the south, both it and a secondary crater <b>facies</b> are mapped (Schaber and McCauley, 1980; McCauley and others, 1981).|$|E
25|$|Diamonds {{are found}} within the intact core of the {{volcanic}} pipe, as well as within some of the marginal breccia <b>facies</b> and maar <b>facies.</b> However, some diamonds are considered to have been resorbed during the post-eruption cooling of the pipe and converted to graphite.|$|E
25|$|The marker {{should be}} {{independent}} of <b>facies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Typical {{metamorphic}} mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in {{the upper}} spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base <b>facies</b> tend {{to be free from}} tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated. The upper flow <b>facies</b> tend to be dominated by talc, chlorite, tremolite, and other magnesian amphiboles (anthophyllite, cummingtonite, gedrite, etc.).|$|E
25|$|On the {{southwest}} of the Yilgarn Craton the Balingup Gneiss Complex is situated inboard from the Early Proterozoic Leeuwin Complex of metamorphic rocks. The Balingup Complex consists primarily of metasedimentary paragneiss, granite orthogneiss, with minor layers of calc-silicate, ultramafic and ortho-amphibolite gneiss. The metamorphic grade {{is considered to be}} peak granulite <b>facies,</b> but the majority has preserved peak amphibolite <b>facies</b> assemblages.|$|E
25|$|The {{volcanic}} pipe is a diatreme, {{composed of}} olivine lamproite, present as tuff and lava. Peripheral volcanic <b>facies</b> suggest the lamproite eruption formed a maar. At {{the margins of}} the volcanic pipe the lamproite is mixed with a volcanic breccia containing shattered wall rock fragments mixed and milled by the eruption. Minerals in the marginal <b>facies</b> include zeolite minerals, micas, kaolinite and clays, typical of post-eruption hydrothermal circulation.|$|E
25|$|The Kayenta Formation {{is part of}} the Glen Canyon Group that {{includes}} formations not only in northern Arizona but also parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. It is composed mostly of two <b>facies,</b> one dominated by silty deposition and the other dominated by sandstone. The siltstone <b>facies</b> is found in much of Arizona, while the sandstone <b>facies</b> is present in areas of northern Arizona, southern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the silty <b>facies</b> as the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. Kayenta Formation deposition was ended by the encroaching dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. A definitive radiometric dating of this formation has not yet been made, and the available stratigraphic correlation has been based on a combination of radiometric dates from vertebrate fossils, magnetostratigraphy and pollen evidence. It has been surmised that the Kayenta Formation was deposited during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian stages of the Early Jurassic Period or approximately 196 to 183 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Variations in the {{characteristic}} content and texture (<b>facies)</b> of the limestone reflect lateral {{changes in the}} environment from north to south.|$|E
25|$|It was {{followed}} in the Middle Bronze Age by the <b>facies</b> of the pile dwellings and of the dammed settlements.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary environments usually exist {{alongside}} {{each other}} in certain natural successions. A beach, where sand and gravel is deposited, is usually bounded by a deeper marine environment a little offshore, where finer sediments are deposited at the same time. Behind the beach, there can be dunes (where the dominant deposition is well sorted sand) or a lagoon (where fine clay and organic material is deposited). Every sedimentary environment has its own characteristic deposits. The typical rock formed in a certain environment is called its sedimentary <b>facies.</b> When sedimentary strata accumulate through time, the environment can shift, forming a change in <b>facies</b> in the subsurface at one location. On the other hand, when a rock layer with a certain age is followed laterally, the lithology (the type of rock) and <b>facies</b> eventually change.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of echinoids {{have been}} {{fluctuating}} across the eons. Among the different proxies, marine <b>facies</b> variation {{in combination with}} outcrop area best explains the palaeodiversity curve.|$|E
25|$|Sedimentary environments {{can shift}} their {{geographical}} positions through time. Coastlines can {{shift in the}} direction of the sea when the sea level drops, when the surface rises due to tectonic forces in the Earth's crust or when a river forms a large delta. In the subsurface, such geographic shifts of sedimentary environments of the past are recorded in shifts in sedimentary <b>facies.</b> This means that sedimentary <b>facies</b> can change either parallel or perpendicular to an imaginary layer of rock with a fixed age, a phenomenon described by Walther's Law.|$|E
25|$|Separating {{the central}} and the {{southern}} provinces was a broad shoal where the platy algal <b>facies</b> was deposited; here waters were moderately turbulent, well-lit, shallow, and somewhat restricted in circulation.|$|E
25|$|Calner (2005) {{notes that}} anachronistic <b>facies</b> are {{observed}} in other strata spanning the Lau event, places the Burgsvik beds immediately after this mass extinction (Calner 2005b), noting {{the occurrence of}} flat-pebble conglomerates in the underlying Eke beds.|$|E
25|$|After the {{spreading}} of Bonnanaro {{culture in the}} Island, {{the tradition of the}} statue-stelae seems to die out, while it continues until 1200 BC with the Nuragic-related Torrean civilization <b>facies</b> of Corsica, featuring warriors represented in the Filitosa sculptures.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} of Kambalda-type Ni-Cu-PGE deposits is distinctive {{because the}} Fe-Ni-Cu sulfides occur {{along the floor}} of a komatiite lava flow, concentrated within a zone of highest flow in the lava channel <b>facies</b> (Lesher et al., 1984).|$|E
25|$|The <b>facies</b> of all {{rocks of}} a certain age can be plotted on a map to give an {{overview}} of the palaeogeography. A sequence of maps for different ages can give an insight {{in the development of the}} regional geography.|$|E
25|$|In {{the east}} side of the Cullarin Block, in the east-pointing finger of the ACT, the Tabberabberan Orogeny also reached the upper greenschist <b>facies</b> again. East–west {{pressure}} caused ruptures forming the Winslade and Deakin Faults and other northwest- or northeast-trending faults.|$|E
25|$|Komatiite {{tends to}} {{fractionate}} from high-magnesium compositions {{in the flow}} bases where olivine cumulates dominate, to lower magnesium compositions higher up in the flow. Thus, the current metamorphic mineralogy of a komatiite will reflect the chemistry, which in turn represents an inference as to its volcanological <b>facies</b> and stratigraphic position.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton is bounded on the east-south east by the ~1,300 Ma Albany-Fraser Orogen, {{composed}} {{primarily of}} amphibolite to greenschist <b>facies</b> sedimentary protolith gneisses, migmatites and granites. The Albany-Fraser Orogen displays both subduction-related and prolonged strike-slip tectonic structures and is intimately interconnected {{with the other}} Proterozoic basins and mobile belts of Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{inside the}} mountain of a major E-W trending platform-basin transition provides the possibility of evaluating fault and fracture networks in many different carbonate <b>facies,</b> ranging from tight platform carbonates to marl-chalk interbedded sequences and porous bioclastic grainstones, present inside the same tectonic structure, and therefore having gone through the same geological evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} shelly ranges were {{deposited in}} a less turbulent and deeper-water environment, having good circulation and relatively large amounts of land-sourced material entering from the south supporting mollusks and sessile, filter-feeding brachiopods. The Osagia, an algal-foraminiferal intergrowth, and other encrusting algae beds in Oklahoma was formed in a shallower, more turbulent, nearer-shore environment marginal to the shelly <b>facies.</b>|$|E
25|$|Komatiite-associated Ni-Cu-PGE {{deposits}} {{can form}} {{in a wide}} range of volcanic environments and overlie a wide range of footwall rocks, including basalts (e.g., Kambalda, Western Australia), andesites (e.g., Alexo, Ontario), dacites (e.g., Bannockburn, Ontario; Silver Swan, Western Australia), rhyolites (e.g., Dee's Flow, Ontario), sulfide <b>facies</b> iron-formations (e.g., Windarra, Western Australia), and sulfidic semi-pelites (e.g., Raglan, Quebec).|$|E
