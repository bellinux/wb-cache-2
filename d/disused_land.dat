2500|$|There {{have been}} many rumours about a {{replacement}} vehicle type. This is most likely the larger, higher-capacity 4x4 or 6x6 Pinzgauer forward-control vehicle similar to the now <b>disused</b> <b>Land</b> Rover 101 forward control, given that the current Land Rover design is also reaching its weight limits due to the increasing amounts of communications and weapons gear used by modern patrol forces. [...] The OVIK Crossway CROSSWAY vehicle has also been mooted as a possible replacement with its 5.4 tonne capacity in 4x4 format and 7.5 tonne capacity in 6x6 format.|$|E

In {{the last few years}} that it was open, Glasgow Zoo deteriorated mainly {{due to the lack of}} funding from the local council and due to many allegations of animal cruelty. The site is now largely populated by private homes with some derelict remnants of the zoo left; the vacant <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> has become a haven for neds and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
50|$|The {{show was}} {{intended}} to show {{a history of the}} area, with tracks dedicated to the industrial revolution, swinging sixties (achieved via a guest appearance by Hank Marvin), and future regeneration of the area. The concert's scale was larger than any seen in the UK before or since, and used vast numbers of fireworks, World War II searchlights, and used entire buildings as giant projection screens throughout the show. The majority of the audience watched from <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> on what is now the site of the ExCeL Exhibition Centre.|$|E
30|$|On these conditions, land {{planning}} {{can help to}} set restrictions on areas subject to natural and man-induced hazard, and on environments of special landscape or cultural value; plan for a lower-impact maintenance of infrastructure; and support regeneration programmes for deteriorated or <b>disused</b> buildings. <b>Land</b> planning can thus open the way for an overall collaboration among different towns and cities, in a perspective of local growth.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, some {{unproductive}} land were useless, so {{they worried}} about its economic development. In this sense, besides the advantages {{given to the}} new settlers, as the donations of <b>disused</b> public <b>lands,</b> were achieved fairs to their villages or were carried out important infrastructure works on the network communications. The fairs {{had the advantage of}} being tax-free, which fomented trade, which was also driven by improving communications (bridges, roads, etc.).|$|R
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} covers a gently hilly area with meadows and pastures, <b>disused</b> arable <b>land</b> and small hills {{overgrown}} with forest. In {{the eastern part}} of the nature reserve lies an observation tower for birdwatching. Several paths and information boards also exist within the reserve. The bird-life of the area is rich, with around 190 species observed in the area, out of which approximately 70 regularly breed within the nature reserve. The species include northern lapwing, common redshank and western yellow wagtail. From the flora, field gentian, globeflower, birds-eye primrose and catsfoot can be mentioned.|$|R

5000|$|The {{areas of}} <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> west {{and east of}} Calvert Lane in Hull (formerly Springhead works and sidings and the land between Springbank East, West and South junctions) have become a {{wildlife}} habitat, the area between the junctions being assessed as [...] "ecologically outstanding". and are classed as Sites of nature conservance importance and is a candidate site for [...] "Local Nature Reserve status". The disused railway bridge giving walkers access to the western site was removed in August 2009. The former sidings at Calvert Lane were developed into a small housing estate [...] "The Sidings" [...] in the 2010s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> {{from the}} scaling {{down of the}} oil {{refinery}} has found {{a number of new}} uses. Part of the site is now occupied by offices of the Environment Agency Wales. Land near the entrance of the old refinery near M4 Junction 43 has been redeveloped as a business park. All of the remaining brownfield land which was occupied by the refinery is being re-developed into a new village called Coed Darcy. The Prince's Trust is an interested party in this development, which seeks to develop the site as an [...] "urban village" [...] in the same vein as the Poundbury village project in Dorset.|$|E
50|$|East of the neighborhood, the LeFrak Organization {{obtained}} {{title to}} most of the <b>disused</b> Erie-Lackawanna <b>land</b> and began the development of Newport, centered around the Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) Newport Station in the 1980s. To the south, the PRR abbatoir were also acquired. Development plans did not include extending the 19th century urban grid to the waterfront, but the construction of large parking decks at the former and strip mall at the latter. The first segment of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail opened in 2002, including the Harsimus Cove Station nearby the landmark Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse.|$|R
50|$|Saint Paul {{planners}} {{were determined}} to turn a liability - more than 200 acres of largely <b>disused</b> railroad <b>land</b> {{in the heart of}} the city. Energy Park was intended as a model urban environment, a product of the mid 1970s' energy crisis. Energy conservation was its theme: people would live and work within the area, most jobs would be energy related, and all buildings would be energy efficient. Little of this actually came to pass, and some critics would consider Energy Park a failure. In 1980 the project received $12.1 million from the federal government as an Urban Development Action Grants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1649 at St George's Hill, Weybridge in Surrey, Gerrard Winstanley {{and others}} calling {{themselves}} The True Levellers occupied <b>disused</b> common <b>land</b> and cultivated it collectively {{in the hope}} that their actions would inspire other poor people to follow their lead. Gerrard Winstanley stated that [...] "the poorest man hath as true a title and just right to the land as the richest man". While the True Levellers, later more commonly known as the Diggers, were perhaps not the first squatters in England, their story illustrates the heritage of squatting as a form of radical direct action.|$|R
5000|$|Batterson Park is {{a public}} park owned by the City of Hartford, Connecticut, though located outside the city limits within the nearby towns of West Hartford, and Farmington. It is near Talcott Mountain State Park, and {{includes}} a large pond with a state-managed boat launch. [...] The pond was formerly used as reservoir managed by the City Water Department, and became a park sometime after 1928, when the water department turned over the <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> to the city. Parts of the land were sold or transferred for private development and highway construction in the time since, including 67 acres sold in 1988 to establish the Hartford Parks Trust Fund. Approximately 600 acres remain.|$|E
5000|$|Cherry Orchard Road is {{also the}} name of a {{proposed}} development planned for the land next to {{the southern part of the}} road that is currently occupied by Cherry Orchard Gardens, Amy Johnson House, the Porter and Sorter public house and some <b>disused</b> <b>land.</b> The planned development would comprise a residential tall building, a hotel, a restaurant/bar, retail outlets and other residential buildings. Part of the development will include pedestrian access to the proposed 'East-West Link' bridge that will enable easier pedestrian travel between East and West Croydon and provide an alternative entrance to East Croydon Station. The new proposal is being developed to take account of concerns expressed about a previous scheme which was withdrawn from planning in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in the late nineteenth century, during the British Raj, and follows the adventures of a Rajput prince who is heir to a fictional kingdom based in Deori (roughly {{comparable}} to modern Chhattisgarh). He has just returned from his education in England. As a sign of his Anglicisation he plans to build a dam and a cricket pitch on <b>disused</b> <b>land</b> in Konpara, a backward and neglected part of his realm. However, when work begins, a fragment of an ancient statue is recovered. Such is its beauty and sensuousness that it is nicknamed the [...] "Venus of Konpara". He decides to excavate the area in search of other remains. Meanwhile, he has been seduced by a Dravidian dancing girl, who becomes his live-in lover and who seems to have a mysterious control over the local people.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid-2000s, the Severnside Community Rail Partnership {{have been}} working to enhance Patchway station. One of the first acts was {{installing}} new community notice boards. A local working group was formed to [...] "adopt" [...] the station, and the group negotiated with Rolls Royce to use their CCTV system to cover the station. A successful bid was made to the Department for Transport's [...] "Access for All" [...] scheme, which provided for improved signage, lighting and seats. A station garden was created in partnership with nearby Patchway Community College, and two decorative mosaics were installed. The <b>disused</b> railway <b>land</b> adjacent to the station was cleared through a Community Payback scheme.|$|R
50|$|In the Second World War, {{the station}} was badly damaged and the bridge over Trierer Straße was blown up. The Aachen-Cologne line was not reopened until 1946. As a result, the {{handling}} of steel, coke and limestone was abandoned and the station became less important for the transfer of freight. Only the connections to Aachen Nord station and the neighbouring Waggonfabrik Talbot rolling stock factory and the Aachen Philips factories on the Venn Railway remained in operation. In contrast, Rothe Erde station continued to serve passengers on the Aachen-Cologne line. In 2004, the freight shed were finally demolished and the now <b>disused</b> railway <b>land</b> was mostly levelled {{for the construction of}} the Aachen Arkaden shopping centre.|$|R
40|$|This research, {{promoted}} by the Università della Svizzera italiana, Accademia di architettura di Mendrisio, through i. CUP (Institute for the Contemporary Urban Project) laid the ground for establishing an observatory of industrial buildings that would give special attention to their fall into disuse and – {{at the same time}} – explore the scenarios for appraising the scope for converting potentially <b>disused</b> buildings and <b>land.</b> The study of disused industrial buildings in Ticino revealed considerable scope for the reuse of potentially disused industrial buildings. The data on buildings put to industrial use show that the number of industrial premises in Ticino is 3, 681 and that they occupy 2, 743 land parcels. The surface area covered by these buildings amounts to 2, 503, 335 square metres, corresponding to 8. 7 % of the total area of land built on in the canton. Land parcels accommodating at least one building put to a mainly industrial use account for 14, 349, 282 square metres of land in Ticino, equal about to 6 % of the overall building area of Ticino Canton. Of the above land and building stock, 1, 120 buildings (casting off 30. 4 %) covering a total surface area of 804, 591 square metres (casting off 32. 1 %) (corresponding to the built surface of Bellinzona commune) qualify as potentially <b>disused</b> and the <b>land</b> parcels accommodating them number 813 (casting off 29. 6 %), 7, 058, 532 sq m (casting off 49. 1 %), equating to about half the surface area of Bellinzona commune.
