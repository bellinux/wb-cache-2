5|$|During {{the evening}} of 1 May 1991, four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an {{unauthorised}} attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The attempt resulted in an armed clash. Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner, {{and the other two}} fled after sustaining minor injuries (one a wounded foot and the other a <b>grazing</b> <b>wound</b> to the head). According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior, the police had been patrolling the Dalj–Borovo Selo road {{at the time of the}} incident. Even though the officers were assigned to the Osijek police administration, the Vinkovci police administrationwhich was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipalityasked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident. Vukovar police contacted him at 4:30a.m., but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing. At 9:00a.m., Vinkovci police chief Josip Džaja telephoned Šoškoćanin and received the same answer. When Reihl-Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later, the latter confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one. Reihl-Kir failed to secure the release of the two captured officers.|$|E

500|$|The {{invasion}} commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, {{the flagship}} for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT {{was destroyed by}} shore fire, {{and he had to}} proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a <b>grazing</b> <b>wound</b> from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On {{the second day of the}} attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A.

50|$|On October 14, 1952, near Kumhwa {{and what}} is today the border between North and South Korea, Schowalter's company was {{selected}} to spearhead {{an attack on a}} fortified Chinese position known as Jane Russell Hill. As he led Company A toward the hill, they came under intense small-arms, grenade, and mortar fire. Schowalter received two <b>grazing</b> <b>wounds</b> to his hand and ankle before being shot in the helmet by a sniper. The bullet lodged under the skin in his right ear and knocked him unconscious. When he awoke, he refused medical attention and resumed leading his soldiers forward. When he was wounded in the right side by a grenade, he again turned away medical aid and continued to command Company A until the hill was taken.|$|R
5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) {{was still in the}} second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot wounds to the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a <b>graze</b> <b>wound</b> to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|R
50|$|On January 10, 2013, {{the school}} {{was the site of}} a {{shooting}} in a classroom. At 9:00 a.m., a gunman armed with a 12-gauge shotgun entered a second-floor classroom where 28 students were present. He shot and seriously wounded 16-year-old Bowe Cleveland. The youth was treated at Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. The shooter shot at but missed another student. He shot at the teacher, Ryan Heber, who suffered a <b>graze</b> <b>wound</b> to the head. Heber and campus supervisor Kim Lee Fields persuaded the gunman to drop his weapon and surrender, and evacuated the students from the room. The gunman was arrested by police, who arrived quickly.In what has become standard response, {{the school was}} placed on lockdown. Students were later picked up by their parents. Counselors were available after students returned to classes.|$|R

2500|$|At 16:00 {{the crew}} of the Sæl spotted two of the E-boats moving at great speed southwards from the Lukksund Narrows between Tysnesøy Island and the mainland. At a {{distance}} of [...] Sæl opened up with her bow gun and for five minutes exchanged fire with the German ships. One of the E-boats was hit by several 37mm rounds and left dead in the water and listing to the side. Soon after, one of Sæls guns was knocked out by a German 20mm shell, and shortly thereafter the firing lanyard on the other gun snapped. With multiple rounds hitting the Norwegian torpedo boat's bow, the E-boats moved into point blank range, riddling Sæl from bow to stern. As the third E-boat arrived on the scene, three torpedoes were fired at Sæl, the two first going under the hull and the third hitting a small rock right in front of her. The explosion caused by the last torpedo further damaged the bow of the Norwegian ship and caused water to start flooding her. With the 7.92 mm Colt machine gun providing cover fire, Fenrik Gulbrandsen beached his vessel at full speed to save the crew. During that last manoeuvre Sæl hit an underwater rock and was left grounded with her stern sticking out of the water. At 16:25 Gulbrandsen ordered the crew to abandon ship. Although one man had suffered a lung shot and six others had minor <b>grazing</b> <b>wounds,</b> all 21 crew members made it ashore.|$|R
40|$|Mutualisms between fungi and fungus-growing {{animals are}} model systems for {{studying}} coevolution and complex interactions between species. Fungal growing behavior has enabled cultivating animals {{to rise to}} major ecological importance, but evolution of farming symbioses {{is thought to be}} restricted to three terrestrial insect lineages. Surveys along 2, 000 km of North America's Atlantic coast documented that the marine snail Littoraria irrorata <b>grazes</b> fungus-infected <b>wounds</b> on live marsh grass throughout its range. Field experiments demonstrate a facultative, farming mutualism between Littoraria and intertidal fungi. Snails graze live grass primarily not to feed but to prepare substrate for fungal growth and consume invasive fungi. Fungal removal experiments show that snails and fungi act synergistically to suppress marsh grass production. These results provide a case of fungus farming in the marine environment and outside the class Insecta and reveal a previously undemonstrated ecological mechanism (i. e., facilitation of fungal invasion) by which grazers can exert top-down control of marine plant production...|$|R
5000|$|On Wednesday, October 10, 2007, Asa H. Coon {{entered the}} five-story school {{building}} shortly before 1:00 p.m. EST, armed with two handguns (a [...]22-caliber revolver and a [...]38-caliber revolver), {{and a box}} of additional rounds of ammunition for each pistol; three folding knives were also in Coon's possession, which were all stocked together in a duffel bag. Wearing a Marilyn Manson concert shirt, black jeans, and black-painted fingernails, Coon walked to the fourth floor of the building and entered the men's washroom where he loaded two revolvers. The shooting began at approximately 1:06 p.m. on the fourth floor of the building, after 14-year-old Michael Peek punched Coon in the face for bumping into him. When Peek walked away, Coon shot him in the abdomen. [...] Another student, 17-year-old Darnell Rodgers, suffered a <b>graze</b> gunshot <b>wound</b> to the elbow in the same hallway. Michael Grassie, a social studies teacher, was shot in the chest when Coon entered his classroom. A second teacher, David Kachadourian, was shot {{in the back of his}} shoulder while in the hallway evacuating his students. During the entire shooting, Coon was said to be cursing. The shooting ended when Coon entered another room and fatally shot himself in the right side of his head.|$|R
40|$|Kelps {{are highly}} {{productive}} seaweeds predominantly found in wave-exposed environments. Physical and biological {{processes such as}} sand abrasion, whiplash and <b>grazing</b> can <b>wound</b> kelp tissue, potentially weakening its ability to withstand wave forces. Despite the ecological importance of kelp tissue loss, few studies have quantified wounding patterns in kelps or how wounding might affect the biomechanical properties of kelps. We quantified the prevalence of wounds on 360 Ecklonia radiata kelps collected across 3 different reef lines (levels of wave exposure) in April (autumn), June (early winter), August (winter) and October (early spring) (i. e. before, during and after peak wave activity). Small holes in the centre of laterals dominated the wounds. Wounding pattern did not differ between reef lines but changed over time, with most in early winter and least in early spring (from 285 to 71 wounds kelp- 1). This pattern suggests that wounds accumulate over summer and that highly wounded parts of the frond (but not the entire kelp) break off when encountering the first storms. Biomechanical break-force tests assessed the effect of experimental wounds on the forces required to break kelp tissue. These tests showed that holes or horizontal cuts {{to the edge of}} the kelp frond dramatically reduced the strength, extensibility, toughness and stiffness of the tissue. We conclude that wounds are common in E. radiata and that the resulting loss of tissue integrity, caused by even small damages, can dramatically increase the susceptibility to breakage. Our findings may have important ecological implications; the peak in wounds in early winter is likely to increase fragmentation of the kelp, thereby reducing its size and hydrodynamic drag, and, paradoxically, reducing the risk of fatal dislodgment during severe winter storms...|$|R
6000|$|Pity and the {{instinct}} of affording relief must needs take the precedence {{even of the}} desire to hear of her husband's fate; and, as the girls hastily whispered, [...] "Here she is," [...] and the lanzknecht hastily tried to gather himself up, and rise with tokens of respect; she bade him remain still, and let her see what she could do for him. In fact, she at once perceived {{that he was in}} no condition to give a coherent account of anything, he was so completely worn out, and in so much suffering. She bade at once that some water should be heated, and some of the broth of the dinner set on the fire; then with the shears at her girdle, and her soft, light fingers, she removed the torn strip of cloth that had been wound round the arm, and cut away the sleeve, showing the arm not broken, but gashed at the shoulder, and thence the whole length <b>grazed</b> and <b>wounded</b> by the descent of the sword down to the wrist. So tender was her touch, that he scarcely winced or moaned under her hand; and, when she proceeded, with Ursel's help, to bathe the wound with the warm water, the relief was such that the wearied man absolutely slumbered during the process, which Christina protracted on that very account. She then dressed and bandaged the arm, and proceeded to skim--as {{no one else in the}} castle would do--the basin of soup, with which she then fed her patient as he leant back in the corner of the settle, at first in the same somnolent, half-conscious state in which he had been ever since the relief from the severe pain; but after a few spoonfuls the light and life came back to his eye, and he broke out, [...] "Thanks, thanks, gracious lady! This is the Lady Baroness for me! My young lord was the only wise man! Thanks, lady; now am I my own man again. It had been long ere the old Freiherrinn had done so much for me! I am your man, lady, for life or death!" [...] And, before she knew what he was about, the gigantic Schneiderlein had slid down on his knees, seized her hand, and kissed it--the first act of homage to her rank, but most startling and distressing to her. [...] "Nay," [...] she faltered, [...] "prithee do not; thou must rest. Only if--if thou canst only tell me if he, my own dear lord, sent me any greeting, I would wait to hear the rest till thou hast slept." ...|$|R
60|$|The general placed {{himself at}} their head. The {{officers}} drew their revolvers. The men {{were instructed to}} use the bayonet only. Then they advanced. The ground is by nature broken and confused to an extraordinary degree. Great rocks, undulations and trees rendered all movements difficult. Frequent tents, sheds and other buildings increased the intricacies. Amidst such surroundings were the enemy, numerous and well armed. The twelve men charged. The tribesmen advanced to meet them. The officers shot down man after man with their pistols. The soldiers bayoneted others. The enemy drew off discomfited, but half the party were killed or wounded. The orderly was shot dead. A sapper and a havildar of the 24th were severely wounded. The general himself {{was struck by a}} sword on the neck. Luckily the weapon turned in his assailant's hand, and only caused a bruise. Captain Holland was shot through the back at close quarters by a man concealed in a tent. The bullet, which caused four <b>wounds,</b> <b>grazed</b> his spine. The party were now too few to effect anything. The survivors halted. Lieutenant Climo took the wounded officer back, and collecting a dozen more men of the 24th, returned to the attack. The second attempt to regain the Quarter Guard was also unsuccessful, and the soldiers recoiled with further loss; but with that undaunted spirit which refuses to admit defeat they continued their efforts, and at the third charge dashed across the open space, bowling over and crushing back the enemy, and the post was recovered. All the ammunition had, however, been carried off by the enemy, and as the expenditure of that night had already been enormous, it was a serious loss. The commissariat lines were at length cleared of the tribesmen, and such of the garrison as could be spared were employed in putting up a hasty defence across the south entrance of the enclosure, and clearing away the cook-houses and other shelters, which might be seized by the enemy.|$|R
