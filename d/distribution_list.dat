500|$|In 1903, the Royal Mint {{made its}} first effort {{to cut back on}} the number of pieces distributed, {{eliminating}} 200Mint workers (principally charwomen and labourers) from the <b>distribution</b> <b>list.</b> [...] Until 1908 Maundy sets could be ordered through banks. [...] Beginning in 1909, however, distribution of the pieces was restricted to Maundy recipients and certain officials. [...] Mintage of sets of Maundy money dropped from 9,929 in 1908 to 2,428 the following year. [...] By 1932, Maundy recipients were routinely selling the coins to dealers at a premium. [...] There was little official response to this until the 1960s, when questions were asked in the House of Lords after the press reported that recipients were being approached by dealers after the service and being offered cash for their gifts. [...] In response, the Royal Mint decreased the number of sets available to officials, though Royal Mint employees of long service are offered the opportunity, every few years, to purchase a set. [...] A number of sets are used as prizes for students at Westminster School, a practice said to have begun with Elizabeth I, though this now occurs only in years when the service is held at Westminster Abbey. [...] Sets distributed by the Royal Mint in these ways are not given in purses, but in presentation cases.|$|E
