5|$|British naturalists {{in colonial}} {{considered}} {{them to be}} among the ugliest birds, and their habit of <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> faeces was particularly despised.|$|E
5|$|By {{selectively}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> nearby {{fruit trees}} and then defecating or regurgitating the seeds within the leks, these birds can actively influence the regeneration and succession {{of the forest}} habitat where they breed.|$|E
5|$|Leptotyphlopidae is {{a family}} of snakes found in North and South America, Africa, and Asia. All are fossorial and adapted to burrowing, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> ants and termites. One species has been {{recorded}} in Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|We {{just saw}} that the <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{relation}} is not transitive, but it still contains some transitivity: for instance: humans <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> rabbits, rabbits <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> carrots, and humans also <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> carrots.|$|R
50|$|For instance, in {{the food}} chain, wolves <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> deer, and deer <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> grass, but wolves do not <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> grass. Thus, the <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{relation}} among life forms is intransitive, in this sense.|$|R
50|$|They <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{trees and}} shrubs, {{except in the}} {{subfamily}} Dioptinae, which <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> herbaceous plants (Miller, 1992). The larvae typically <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> only one family of trees, but closely related species will <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> distantly related plants; for example different members of the genus Datana <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Juglandaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Ericaceae and Anacardiaceae (Miller 1992).|$|R
5|$|Like {{other member}} of the Phallaceae family, the mature fungus attracts insects with its smell to help {{disperse}} its spores. Psilopyga fasciata, a stinkhorn beetle of the sap beetle family, has been recorded <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the gleba of Mexican specimens.|$|E
5|$|Most are carnivores, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> annelids, {{clams and}} crustaceans, and may kill annelids of {{about their own}} size. They {{sometimes}} take fish, both living and dead. Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two terrestrial species of Argonemertes.|$|E
5|$|The {{fin whale}} is a filter-feeder, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> small {{schooling}} fish, squid and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E

50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Succisa pratensis and Scabiosa columbaria. They first <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the seeds. Later, they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{the lower}} leaves from within a {{portable}} case.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Plantago maritima, Triglochin palustris and Salicornia species. First {{generation}} larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the flowerheads, {{while the}} second generation <b>feeds</b> <b>on</b> the shoots and rootstock.|$|R
5|$|The {{introduced}} European {{honey bee}} (Apis mellifera) {{has also been}} observed <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> B.sessilis, as have seven species of native bee, comprising four species of Hylaeus (including the banksia bee H. alcyoneus), two of Leioproctus, and a Lasioglossum.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{has only}} one known direct predator: a small, undescribed native wasp from the family Ichneumonidae has been {{observed}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> katipo eggs.|$|E
5|$|The storm petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, {{relatives of the}} petrels, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|E

50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Rhizophoraceae species. They <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> {{the closed}} apical leaf buds of their host plant when young. Later, they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> newly {{expanding}} leaves which they web together.|$|R
50|$|The larvae of sap flies <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the sap of {{deciduous}} and {{coniferous trees}} (sap runs) and <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> micro-organisms within the sap. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> nectar, and other fermenting substances.|$|R
5|$|The storm-petrels are the {{smallest}} seabirds, {{relatives of the}} petrels, <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Four species have been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The three known {{species of}} vampire bats all seem {{more similar to}} one another than to any other species. That {{suggests}} that sanguivorous habits (<b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> blood) evolved only once, and the three species share a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The thrushes are a {{group of}} {{passerine}} birds that occur mainly but not exclusively in the Old World. They are plump, soft plumaged, small to medium-sized insectivores or sometimes omnivores, often <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Many have attractive songs.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Arundinaria tecta. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Chasmanthium latifolia. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Cynodon dactylon. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
5|$|The thrushes are plump, soft-plumaged, {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} insectivores or sometimes omnivores, often <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Many have attractive songs. There are about 90 species worldwide, six in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|They are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and sometimes}} eat carrion, making them {{one of the}} few snakes to do so. Campbell and Lamar (2004) described having seen them <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> fish heads and viscera that had been thrown into the water from a dock. Heinrich and Studenroth (1996) reported an occasion in which an individual was seen <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the butchered remains of a feral hog (Sus scrofa) that had been thrown into Cypress Creek.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species are adapted to {{spending}} {{a portion of their}} time <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Dalechampia species. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> rotting fruit.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Malpighia glabra. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Malvaviscus drummondii. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively dsRNA can be {{supplied}} without genetic engineering. One {{approach is to}} add them to irrigation water. The molecules are absorbed into the plants' vascular system and poison insects <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{predation}} of {{the adult}} cicada is common, with wrens and grey fantails, noisy miners, blue-faced honeyeaters, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, magpie-larks, Torresian crows, white-faced herons and even the nocturnal tawny frogmouth, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed <b>feeding</b> <b>on</b> emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.|$|E
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Rutaceae species. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> various grasses. Adults <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> flower nectar.|$|R
50|$|The larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> Salsola vermiculata. Young larvae <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the infructescence. Later, they <b>feed</b> <b>on</b> the fruit. They {{create a}} trivalved case of 6-7 mm long with a mouth angle of 80-85Â°.|$|R
