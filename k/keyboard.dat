5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken <b>keyboard</b> design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the <b>keyboard</b> received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same <b>keyboard</b> short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, <b>keyboard</b> music {{generally}} was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any <b>keyboard</b> instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance <b>keyboard</b> music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E

5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier <b>keyboard</b> {{instruments}} from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like <b>keyboard</b> on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which means it can play more than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal <b>keyboard</b> or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E

5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a <b>keyboard.</b> Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the <b>keyboard</b> compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

5|$|Beer's first <b>keyboard</b> {{instructor}} was Franz Lauska, a pupil of Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and a favoured {{teacher at}} the Berlin court. Beer also became one of Muzio Clementi's pupils while Clementi was in Berlin. The boy made his public debut in 1801 playing Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto in Berlin. The Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung reported: 'The amazing <b>keyboard</b> playing of young Bär (a Jewish lad of 9), who carried off the difficult passages and other solo parts with aplomb, and has fine powers of rendition even more rarely found {{in one of his}} age, made the concert even more interesting'.|$|E

5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the <b>keyboard),</b> which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own <b>keyboard</b> and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
