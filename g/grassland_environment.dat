50|$|Sun Valley, named {{so in the}} 1960s to {{coincide}} with the residential subdivision, has also over time been known as The Valley, Fitzgerald’s Valley, Valley Flats and Deane’s Valley and was used in the 1800s as a vital stopover for explorers crossing the Great Dividing Range. The creeks, rich soil, open forest and native <b>grassland</b> <b>environment</b> was ideal for the farming, grazing and logging conducted in these times. The valley was once roamed by wild brumbies and is renowned for its magnificent stands of mountain blue gum trees, pretty setting and walking tracks in and around Long Angle Gully and the historical “Warrimoo Pool” site.

50|$|Radiocarbon {{dating and}} {{analysis}} of pollen in buried soils {{have shown that the}} environment of lowland Britain changed around 4250-4000 BCE. The change to a <b>grassland</b> <b>environment</b> from damp, heavy soils and expanses of dense forest was mostly brought about by farmers, probably through the use of slash and burn techniques. Environmental factors may also have made a contribution. Pollen is poorly preserved in the chalky soils found around Avebury, so the best evidence for the state of local environment {{at any time in the}} past comes from the study of the deposition of snail shells. Different species of snail live in specific habitats, so the presence of a certain species indicates what the area was like at a particular point in time. The available evidence suggests that in the early Neolithic, Avebury and the surrounding hills were covered in dense oak woodland, and as the Neolithic progressed, the woodland around Avebury and the nearby monuments receded and was replaced by grassland.|$|E

40|$|The middle Pleistocene fossil mammal {{assemblage}} from Lainyamok in {{the southern}} Kenya rift has previously been considered the oldest (330 - 392 ka) African mammal community consisting entirely of extant species, with the dominant bovid tentatively attributed to the southern African blesbok (Damaliscus cf. dorcas). We show that the blesbok-like fossils from Lainyamok belong to an extinct species, described here as Damaliscus hypsodon sp. nov. The D. hypsodon hypodigm includes the previously unnamed small alcelaphine material known from late Pleistocene sites elsewhere in Kenya and Tanzania. Its dental anatomy, together with an ecomorphological analysis of its postcrania, indicates that D. hypsodon grazed in open and arid <b>grassland</b> <b>environments.</b> Although Lainyamok is no longer represented entirely by extant species, the absence of species common earlier in the middle Pleistocene of East Africa suggests substantial faunal turnover between 500 and 400 ka. Damaliscus hypsodon persisted in East Africa {{until the end of}} the Pleistocene and its extinction can be attributed to a loss of arid <b>grassland</b> <b>environments</b> at the onset of the Holocene. The fossil evidence from southern Kenya suggests that the development of the taxonomically modern large mammal community was a long-term process characterized by the extinction of grazing specialists, with marked turnover occurring between ~ 500 and 400 ka and near the end of the Pleistocene...|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the diet of the {{mountain}} hare varies from region to region. It seems to be somewhat dependent on the particular habitat that the population under study lives in. For example, in northern Scandinavia where snow may blanket the ground for many months, the hares may graze on twigs and bark. In areas where snowfall is rare, such as Ireland, grass may form the bulk of the diet. Given a choice, mountain hares in Scotland and Ireland seem to prefer feeding on grasses. One study looking at mountain hares on a coastal <b>grassland</b> <b>environment</b> in Ireland found that grasses constituted over 90% of the diet. This was higher than the percentage of grass in the diet of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that inhabited the same environment. The mountain hare is regionally the favourite prey of the golden eagle and may additionally be predated by Eurasian eagle-owls and red foxes. Stoats may prey on young hares.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{findings}} at Melkhoutboom, several conclusions have been drawn. The plant and animal remains in the Melkhoutboom sequence {{have been used to}} make inferences about the environment of the Eastern Cape region during the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene occupations of the cave. There are noticeable differences between the faunal remains found in the units corresponding to the Wilton Industry and the underlying units. In the lower levels, the primary species represented in the faunal record are zebra, hartebeest, and wildebeest, which are all diurnal herd animals and grazers preferring a <b>grassland</b> <b>environment.</b> In the Wilton Base Marker and overlying units, the faunal remains are primarily of nocturnal, non-herding animals that generally prefer a more vegetated environment. This change is thought to represent and correspond to a decrease in grassland and increase in scrub and brush that began in the terminal Pleistocene and continued into the Holocene. It is unknown whether this environmental change occurred as a result of human activity, but it is thought to be a natural occurrence that may have been reinforced by human activity.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at Elands Bay Cave {{began in}} the 1970s. Scientific interest has focused on investigating coastal changes, subsistence and seasonal mobility. Faunal remains representing the time period of 13.600-12.000 years ago were {{left behind by the}} cave's occupants. [...] The majority of the faunal assemblage consists of grazing animals and is indicative of a <b>grassland</b> <b>environment.</b> The faunal remains were examined and compared to collections at the South Africa Museum in Cape Town. Few marine specimens were recovered from this time span and is indicative of the 12 km distance from the cave to the coast. Cartwright and Parkington (1997) excavated 6,700 fragments of wood charcoal that were retrieved through dry sieving large soil samples of 39 collections. Excavation of wood charcoal and pollen in the cave suggests that last glacial maximum had wetter conditions with lush forests and Afromontane elements 20,000 years ago. There were also varieties of charcoal tested from 20,000, 13,500, and 10,500 years ago. Researchers have also analyzed micromammals, such as mice, as paleoenvironmental indicators. Micromammal remains were encountered during excavations and occur throughout the units dating from 13,260 to 300 years before present. The micromammal specimens were recovered using 12mm and 3mm sieves, however, the researchers comment that this mesh size was likely too large to account for smaller faunal remains. Understanding the taphonomic processes that contributed to the deposition of the micromammal remains at Elands Bay Cave is important because it has identified a number of predators likely responsible for the accumulation of faunal material. that became a great tool for formation of micromammal collection. Excavations in Elands Bay Cave and surrounding areas support a hypothesis of migration in winter months. Assemblages of shellfish findings portray that the theory of shellfish changing in size during prehistoric times because of environment was overthrown and was replaced by consuming large amounts of shellfish at the time. Observations and excavations were done in Elands Bay Cave in order to properly identify species of fish bones with accurate representation in specific levels. Excavations that were conducted from 1970 to 1978 in Elands Bay Cave concluded that there was a stratified sequence of deposits that dated to the late Pleistocene. Between 8000 and 6000 years ago, the rise in sea level eventually resulted in the present location of Elands Bay Cave now on the coast. [...] Excavations after 4,000 BP revealed there were 13 different species of fish represented at the site, 6 of which are still found today in the aquatic milieus. These findings supported the conclusion that due to the close proximity to the coast, fishing activities were the dominant subsistence strategy practiced by the people who occupied Elands Bay Cave. [...] With the coastline in its present-day location by about 6000 years ago, the inhabitants of the cave were thus in a favorable location to exploit marine resources.|$|E

40|$|Grassland {{degradation}} is {{a complicated}} process and result of multi-system interaction. Observation on grassland vegetation growth and change is of critical importance to grassland resource management and environment construction. However, most of estimations on grassland degradation neglect sensitivity of grassland vegetation to annual climate change, and few of them considers the directive meaning of grassland degradation progress to the recovery of <b>grassland</b> <b>environment.</b> Therefore the results of different estimation methods are usually inconsistent and incomparable, which further leads to inconvenience in the implementation and supervision of <b>grassland</b> <b>environment</b> recovery. This paper proposed a new method to estimate grassland degradation based on discriminating the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on vegetation. A historical maximum growth model is constructed to evaluate the “ideal ” status of vegetation growth under fixed climatic conditions. The impact of non-climatic factors on vegetation could be measured by the difference between realistic and “ideal ” status of vegetation growth. And then the change degree and direction of grassland degradation are estimated also. We applied the method in case study area of Xilin Gole Steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, by using Pathfinder NOAA/AVHRR NDVI data from 1983 to 2000 and the meteorological data within the same period. Comparing with results of others, this method is more accurate with respect to estimating spatial distribution and changing trend of grassland degradation. Moreover, it produces more consistent result comparing to the actual case. 1...|$|E

However, as conditions improved, farmers’ recognition and acceptance of the GBP became negative. Although farmers recognized the benefits of the GBP, they showed little awareness of the long-term process of environmental governance. As can be seen from the farmers’ ecological awareness and their attitudes toward the GBP, they are more inclined to value short-term economic interest than ecological protection.

40|$|The summer (May–September) time {{budgets of}} 14 generalist {{herbivore}} species {{living in the}} same <b>grassland</b> <b>environment</b> are presented in terms of various component activities (e. g., walking, feeding, resting, etc.). All the species exhibit a decrease in activity as average daily air temperature increases. Greater body size and variety of habitats used by a species lead to increased time spent active. Use of a greater variety of habitats may increase activity time because different habitats provide suitable thermal conditions for activity at different times of the day. Body size affects sn herbivore's thermal balance through metabolism, body surface area and thermal inertia. The time spent feeding, exclusive of time spent searching for foods, is less for large than small herbivores. This may arise because large species must spend more time walking in the search for food to satisfy their energy requirements. The observed feeding time differences for species composing a common trophic level in a single environment may help to explain their diet choice because feeding time constrains the variety of foods an herbivore can select. Diet differences, in turn, can explain the potential competition for food if food is in short supply...|$|E

Mammal taxa were changing as well to accommodate the changing flora. The mammal faunas from three cave sites in Central Missouri were chosen to test two methods of paleoecological reconstruction.

There was a positive and significant correlation between the number of captures and monthly minimum and maximum average temperatures. Recruitment was observed from January to April. During the study, the area was affected by human activities, which altered the community structure: Pseudablabes agassizii was negatively affected by habitat devastation while Liophis poecilogyrus took advantage of this. Our results reinforced the impression that Pseudablabes agassizii is a habitat specialist species.
