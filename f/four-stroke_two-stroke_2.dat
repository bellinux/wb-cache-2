5000|$|The term [...] usually {{refers to}} an engine in which {{combustion}} is intermittent, such as the more familiar <b>four-stroke</b> and <b>two-stroke</b> piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described. Firearms are also a form of internal combustion engine.|$|R

50|$|Fiscal {{horsepower}} also {{lives on}} in Spain, but is defined simply in terms of overall engine capacity.

5000|$|Two-stroke engines {{have fewer}} moving parts than {{four-stroke}} engines, and produce {{twice the number}} of power strokes per revolution; consequently, two-stroke engines are more powerful for their mass. Two-strokes offer stronger acceleration, but similar top speed compared to a <b>four-stroke</b> engine. [...] <b>Two-stroke</b> engines have shorter life due to poorer piston lubrication, since lubrication comes from the fuel-oil mix.|$|R

25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket internal combustion engine (ICE) motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles. These include both <b>four-stroke</b> and <b>two-stroke</b> gasoline engine designs. Among these, Golden Eagle Bike Engines currently produces a rear-engine (rack-mounted) kit using a belt to drive the rear wheel. Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (friction drive) or a chain-driven, geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke gas engines mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or chain-driven transmissions and final drives. Some of these brands include Jiangdu Flying Horse Gasoline Engine Factory Ltd., EZ Motorbike Company, Inc., Mega Motors Inc., and Grubee Inc.|$|R
5000|$|The Achates Power opposed-piston engine, {{is modeled}} after the opposed-piston {{architecture}} made popular by the Junkers Jumo 205/207 aviation engines developed in the 1930s. The design positions two pistons per cylinder—working in opposite, reciprocating motion. This eliminates parts including the cylinder head and valvetrain, improving overall engine efficiency as these components are considered primary contributors to heat and friction losses. [...] The cylinder head and valvetrain systems are also among the most complex and costly elements of conventional engines.The two-stroke cycle compounds the efficiency benefits of the opposed-piston engine architecture. With this cycle, each combustion event is shorter in duration and, therefore, closer to optimum timing as compared to <b>four-stroke</b> engines. <b>Two-stroke</b> engines are also smaller in displacement and size compared to four-stroke engines for similar performance.|$|R
50|$|A dry-sump {{system is}} a method to manage the {{lubricating}} motor oil in <b>four-stroke</b> and large <b>two-stroke</b> piston driven internal combustion engines. The dry-sump system uses two or more oil pumps and a separate oil reservoir, {{as opposed to a}} conventional wet-sump system, which uses only the main sump (U.S.: oil pan) below the engine and a single pump. A dry-sump engine requires a pressure relief valve to regulate negative pressure inside the engine, so internal seals are not inverted.|$|R
50|$|Cam {{engines are}} <b>two-stroke,</b> rather than <b>four-stroke.</b> In a <b>two-stroke</b> engine, the {{forces on the}} piston act uniformly downwards, {{throughout}} the cycle. In a four-stroke engine, these forces reverse cyclically: in the induction phase, the piston is forced upwards, against the reduced induction depression. The simple cam mechanism only works with a force in one direction. In the first Michel engines, the cam had two surfaces, a main surface on which the pistons worked when running and another ring inside this that gave a desmodromic action to constrain the piston position during engine startup.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Two-stroke,</b> <b>Four-stroke,</b> and {{continuous}} machine {{are very different}} from each other. However it was shown [...] that there is a quantum regime where all these machines become thermodynamically equivalent to each other. While the intra cycle dynamics in the equivalence regime is very different in different engine types, when the cycle is completed they all turn out to provide the same amount of work and consume the same amount of heat (hence they share the same efficiency as well). This equivalence is associated with a coherent work extraction mechanism and has no classical analogue.|$|R
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even <b>four-stroking.</b> Some <b>two-stroke</b> turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenient}} {{method has}} been developed for determining the scavenging efficiency or the charging efficiency of two-stroke-cycle engines. The method consists of introducing a suitable tracer gas into the inlet air of the running engine and measuring chemically its concentration both in the inlet and exhaust gas. Monomethylamine CH(sub 3) NH(sub 2) was found suitable for the purpose as it burns almost completely during combustion, whereas the "short-circuited" portion does not burn at all and can be determined quantitatively in the exhaust. The method was tested both on <b>four-stroke</b> and on <b>two-stroke</b> engines and is considered accurate within 1 percent...|$|R
5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} <b>four-stroke</b> or <b>two-stroke</b> cycle. [...] Their normal {{operation}} was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate scavenge air valve.|$|R
40|$|Marine engines {{have evolved}} a lot through time. From the {{earliest}} instances of rowing {{equipment to the}} advanced machinery, propulsion engines have become a critical part in the efficiency of marine vessels. These engines can be classified and selected using various characteristics and types, such as its operating cycle. Engines can come in either the <b>four-stroke</b> or the <b>two-stroke</b> version. <b>Four-stroke</b> engines are primarily used in cars, buses, and trucks due to their lower noise production and higher stability in motion. Two-stroke engines are best used in scooters, motorcycles, ships, where space can present a constraint and noise is not an issue. Marine vessels favor the use of two-stroke engines as opposed to four-stroke ones due to fuel usage, engine efficiency, and power-to-weight ratio...|$|R
40|$|Completing {{the first}} paper dealing with {{charging}} methods and arrangements, {{the present paper}} discusses the design forms of two-stroke engines. Features which largely influence piston running are: (a) The shape and surface condition of the sliding parts. (b) The cylinder and piston materials. (c) Heat conditions in the piston, and lubrication. There is little essential difference between <b>four-stroke</b> and <b>two-stroke</b> engines with ordinary pistons. In large engines, for example, are always found separately cast or welded frames in which the stresses are taken up by tie rods. Twin piston and timing piston engines often differ from this design. Examples {{can be found in}} many engines of German or foreign make. Their methods of operation will be dealt with in the third part of the present paper, which also includes the bibliography. The development of two-stroke engine design is, of course, mainly concerned with such features as are inherently difficult to master; that is, the piston barrel and the design of the gudgeon pin bearing. Designers of four-stroke engines now-a-days experience approximately the same difficulties, since heat stresses have increased to the point of influencing conditions in the piston barrel. Features which notably affect this are: (a) The material. (b) Prevailing heat conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The {{overview}} given above may {{describe a}} modern {{version of the}} Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes [...] "a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It {{is clear from the}} context that [...] "gas" [...] means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether <b>four-stroke</b> or <b>two-stroke)</b> has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional [...] "compression control valve" [...] (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This [...] "will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads".|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{heat engines}} {{driven by the}} Johnson-Nyquist noise of {{resistors}} are introduced. They utilize Coulomb's law and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical physics that is the reverse phenomenon of heat dissipation in a resistor. No steams, gases, liquids, photons, combustion, phase transition, or exhaust/pollution are present here. In these engines, instead of heat reservoirs, cylinders, pistons and valves, resistors, capacitors and switches are the building elements. For the best performance, {{a large number of}} parallel engines must be integrated to run in a synchronized fashion and the characteristic size of the elementary engine must be at the 10 nanometers scale. At room temperature, in the most idealistic case, a two-dimensional ensemble of engines of 25 nanometer characteristic size integrated on a 2. 5 x 2. 5 cm silicon wafer with 12 Celsius temperature difference between the warm-source and the cold-sink would produce a specific power of about 0. 4 Watt. Regular and coherent (correlated-cylinder states) versions are shown and both of them can work in either <b>four-stroke</b> or <b>two-stroke</b> modes. The coherent engines have properties that correspond to coherent quantum heat engines without the presence of quantum coherence. In the idealistic case, all these engines have Carnot efficiency, which is the highest possible efficiency of any heat engine, without violating the second law of thermodynamics.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a diesel engine quasi-dimensional numerical model, implemented in a previously developed 0 D model. The presented model uses direct {{solution to the}} conservation equations set for cylinder pressure and zone temperatures without numerical iterations which are customary in these models. Numerical model validation was performed on a four-stroke diesel engine at four operating points. After successful validation, modifications were implemented in the numerical model allowing the simulation of a marine two-stroke diesel engine. It is important {{to emphasize that the}} simulation model logic remained unchanged. The only significant differences are the changes in the engine working processes and different calculation of the engine operating parameters which are characteristic of two-stroke engines. The results of the diesel engine simulations using the quasi-dimensional model were compared to the test-bed measurements of the two-stroke engine found in available literature. Good agreement between the measurements and the simulation results for the two-stroke engine has been obtained. The developed quasi-dimensional numerical model can accurately predict operating parameters of the <b>four-stroke</b> and the <b>two-stroke</b> diesel engine...|$|R

Two more additional strokes are the fifth stroke, which called water injection stroke while the last stroke is called exhaust stroke.

After the modification, performance results outcomes are compare with the conventional four-stroke engines. Unfortunately, this engine is not running as well as expected when some problems occur at few part of the engine.

5000|$|While growing {{consistently}} {{since the}} '70s, {{in the early}} part of the 21st Century Supercross' popularity really took off. In the United States, Supercross races today are now some of the most popular races regularly held. The American Motorcyclist Association awards three Supercross Championship Champs each year. They are the 450cc (was known as 250cc two-stroke), and both an East and West division on the 250cc (was 125cc two-stroke). World Supercross Champions are named by other racing organizations around the world. Supercross racing classifications are governed by the displacement of the motorcycle's engine based on two-stroke engines until 2006, as <b>four-stroke</b> engines replaced <b>two-stroke</b> engines. Since then, the AMA has labeled the classes by four-stroke displacement. From 2007 until 2012, a formula nomenclature similar to INDYCAR was used, with the 450cc class known as Supercross and 250cc as Supercross Lites. Starting in 2013, the AMA and Feld Motor Sports returned to the traditional nomenclature, based on four-stroke engines—450cc (known as [...] "MX1" [...] in Europe), and 250cc displacement levels (also known as [...] "MX2"). The 450cc Champion has always been generally considered to be the most prestigious.|$|R
