40|$|Context: Low {{levels of}} nonandrogenic {{anabolic}} hormones {{have been linked}} with frailty, but evidence is conflicting and prospective data are largely lacking. Objective: To determine associations between nonandrogenic anabolic hormones and prospective changes in frailty status. Design/Setting: A 4. 3 -year prospective observational study of community-dwelling men participating in the European Male Ageing Study. Participants: Men (n = 3369) aged 40 to 79 years from eight European centers. Main Outcome Measures: Frailty status was determined using frailty phenotype (FP; n = 2114) and frailty index (FI; n = 2444). Analysis: Regression models assessed relationships between baseline levels of insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF- 1), its binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), with changes in frailty status (worsening or improving frailty).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Nutritional {{factors in}} early life may have {{long-term}} physiologic effects in humans. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) play {{important roles in}} protecting against cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Our aim {{was to examine the}} association of birth weight (BW) with serum long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) profile in adolescents. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 772 European adolescents (56. 3 % females) aged 14. 7 ± 1. 2 years were included in this study. Information on BW and gestational age was obtained from parental records. DHA, EPA and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations were measured in serum phospholipids. Alfa-linolenic (ALA), linoleic (LA), AA, EPA and DHA intakes assessed by a computer based 24 h dietary recall. Gender, gestational age, pubertal status, body mass <b>index,</b> <b>center</b> and total energy and LCPUFA intakes were used as confounders in all the analyses. RESULTS: BW was significantly associated with serum DHA and EPA (both adjusted P< 0. 05) independently of potential confounders including their main dietetic source. We did not observe any significant relationship between BW and serum AA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early metabolic changes, as a result from prenatal environmental influences, could affect long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism later in life. These results may contribute to explain the relationship between early nutrition and growth and later metabolic disorders as CVD. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

This study is aimed at measuring the combined influences of visual information, spatial working memory, and proprioceptive feedback on the diminished postural control in PD. Design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial. Participants and settings: Twenty six patients with PD participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to either group one (G 1) who received proprioceptive training with task related visual biofeedforward/back using a force platform in addition to a traditional physical therapy program or group two (G 2) who received only the traditional physiotherapy program. Outcome measures: Rhythmic weight shift, sit to stand and tandem gait examination protocols of the computerized dynamic posturography were used to measure the sensorimotor performance. Results: Significant improvements were observed (P < 0. 05) in on-axis velocity, directional control, weight transfer, rising <b>index,</b> <b>center</b> of gravity sway, step width, speed, end sway. In G 2 a significant improvement is only observed with sit to stand test.

30|$|During {{the initial}} {{fragmentation}} stage of Perthes disease, the principle focus {{is to achieve}} containment of the femoral head within the acetabulum. Whether by bracing, abduction casts, femoral and/or pelvic osteotomy, the goals are to maximize the range of hip motion and to avoid incongruity, hoping to avert subsequent femoro-acetabular impingement or hinge abduction. A more subtle and insidious manifestation of the disease relates to growth disturbance involving the femoral neck. We have chosen to tether the greater trochanteric physis, combined with a medial soft tissue release, {{as part of our}} non-osteotomy management strategy for select children with progressive symptomatology and related radiographic changes. In addition to providing containment, we feel that this strategy addresses potential long-range issues pertaining to limb length and abductor mechanics, while avoiding iatrogenic varus deformity caused by osteotomy. This is a retrospective review of 12 patients (nine boys, three girls), average age 7.3  years old (range 5.3 – 9.7), who underwent non-osteotomy surgery for Perthes disease. An eight-plate was applied to the greater trochanteric apophysis at the time of arthrogram, open adductor and iliopsoas tenotomy, and Petrie cast application. We compared clinical and radiographic findings at the outset to those at an average follow-up of 49  months (range 14 – 78  months). Six plates were subsequently removed; the others remain in situ. Eleven of twelve patients experienced improvement in pain, and alleviation of limp and Trendelenburg sign at latest follow-up. The majority had improved or maintained range of motion and prevention of trochanteric impingement demonstrated by near normalization of abduction. Neck-shaft angles, Shenton’s line, extrusion <b>index,</b> <b>center</b> edge angles and trochanteric height did not change significantly. One patient underwent subsequent trochanteric distalization and no other patients have undergone subsequent femoral or periacetabular osteotomies. Leg length discrepancy worsened in four patients and was treated with contralateral eight-plate distal femoral epiphysiodesis. As a group the mean leg length discrepancy did not change significantly. There were no perioperative complications. six trochanteric plates were subsequently removed after an average of 43.7  months (range 28 – 69) due to irritation of hardware; the others remain in situ, pending further growth. We employed open adductor and iliopsoas tenotomy and Petrie cast application and guided growth of the greater trochanter as a means of redirecting the growth of the common proximal femoral chondroepiphysis. The accrued benefits of preventing relative trochanteric overgrowth with a flexible tether are the avoidance of iatrogenic varus and weakening of the hip abductors. The goals are to preserve abductor strength and avoid trochanteric transfer or intertrochanteric osteotomy.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that center- and sex-specific fall rates explained one-third of between-center variation in upper limb fractures across Europe. In this current analysis, our {{aim was to}} determine how much of the between-center variation in fractures could be attributed to repeated falling, bone mineral density (BMD), and other risk factors in individuals, and to compare the relative contributions of center-specific BMD vs. center-specific fall rates. A clinical history of fracture was assessed prospectively in 2451 men and 2919 women aged 50 - 80 from 20 centers participating in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) using standardized questionnaires (mean follow-up = 3 years). Bone mineral density (BMD, femoral neck, trochanter, and/or spine) was measured in 2103 men and 2565 women at these centers. Cox regression was used to model the risk of incident fracture {{as a function of the}} person-specific covariates: age, BMD, personal fracture history (PFH), family hip fracture history (FAMHIP), time spent walking/cycling, number of 'all falls' and falls not causing fracture ('fracture-free') during follow-up, alcohol consumption, and body mass <b>index.</b> <b>Center</b> effects were modeled by inclusion of multiplicative gamma-distributed random effects, termed center-shared frailty (CSF), with mean 1 and finite variance theta (theta) acting on the hazard rate. The relative contributions of center-specific fall risk and center-specific BMD on the incidence of limb fractures were evaluated as components of CSF. In women, the risk of any incident nonspine fracture (n = 190) increased with age, PFH, FAMHIP, > or = 1 h/day walking/cycling, and number of 'all falls' during follow-up (all P < 0. 074). 'Fracture-free' falls (P = 0. 726) and femoral neck BMD did not have a significant effect at the individual level, but there was a significant center-shared frailty effect (theta = 0. 271, P = 0. 001) that was reduced by 4 % after adjusting for mean center BMD and reduced by 19 % when adjusted for mean center fall rate. Femoral trochanter BMD was a significant determinant of lower limb fractures (n = 53, P = 0. 014) and the center-shared frailty effect was significant for upper limb fractures (theta = 0. 271, P = 0. 011). This upper limb fracture center effect was unchanged after adjusting for mean center BMD but was reduced by 36 % after adjusting for center mean fall rates. In men, risk of any nonspine fracture (n = 75) increased with PFH, fall during follow-up (P < 0. 026), and with a decrease in trochanteric BMD [RR 1. 38 (1. 08, 1. 79) per 1 SD decrease]. There was no center effect evident (theta = 0. 081, P = 0. 096). We conclude that BMD alone cannot be validly used to discriminate between the risk of upper limb fractures across populations without taking account of population-specific variations in fall risk and other factors. These variations might reflect shared environmental or possibly genetic factors that contribute quite substantially to the risk of upper limb fractures in women. status: publishe...|$|E

The models clearly underestimate the large NaI 2. 21 values measured for most early-type galaxies. However, we develop a Na-enhanced version of our newly developed models in the NIR, which - together with the effect of a bottom-heavy initial mass function - yield NaI 2. 21 indices in the range of the observations. Therefore, we suggest a scenario in which the combined effect of [Na/Fe] enhancement and a bottom-heavy initial mass function are mainly responsible for the large NaI 2. 21 indices observed for most early-type galaxies. To a smaller extent, also [C/Fe] enhancement might contribute to the large observed NaI 2. 21 values. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

In a colonoscopic surveillance programme, colorectal mucosal biopsies from 104 patients with ulcerative colitis were examined by flow cytometry, and the DNA indices determined and compared with findings of cellular dysplasia. In 17 patients, DNA aneuploidy was diagnosed, with DNA indices ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 0, median 1. 9. Three patients with high grade dysplasia all had DNA indices within the triploid region. These results were compared with the DNA indices {{from a group of}} 49 patients with non‐colitis‐associated aneuploid colorectal carcinomas, in which the levels ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 0 with a median value of 1. 5. Accordingly, the DNA index in the colitis patients with aneuploidy was more often within the tetraploid region. These results, obtained in patients with ulcerative colitis, indicate a possible precancerous progress from diploidy over tetraploidy to triploidy also in patients with long‐standing ulcerative colitis. In addition, the results speak in favour of a connection between DNA indices in the triploid region and more profound premalignant alterations...|$|R
