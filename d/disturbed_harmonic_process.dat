Statistical properties for the mean value and the variance of the sample mean estimator are deduced as well. These conditions are applied to cubic-phase coupling detection, stressing the study of nonergodic signals and possible strategies to study them. Numerical examples to illustrate these conditions for cubic phase coupling detection and separation of mixed signals using independent component analysis (ICA) methods are also showed in this paper.

The designers should efficiently create stable and robust designs using low-cost components with high parameter variations. Methods to test statistically the dynamical properties of final design would enable the designers to evaluate control design before production ramp-up.

Harmonics reduction that has been achieved with the passive filters is not quite satisfactory, thus development of active filters is required. This research proposes the use of parallel active filter design using a three-level inverter with the scheme of Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) that is used to reduce harmonics. The use of three stages Multilevel Inverter (MLI) on parallel active filter has several advantages that are lowering harmonic distortion and reducing stress switching. From the simulation results, it was obtained that three parallel active filters were capable of reducing the level of harmonic currents and voltages at the source; THDi before installation of the filter was equal to 26, 16 % and can be lowered to 2, 42 %. While THDv was reduced from 0, 45 % to 0, 17 %.
