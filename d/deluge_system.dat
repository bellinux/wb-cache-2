50|$|A {{permanently}} installed fire curtain line set, though not used for productions, {{is a typical}} element of a theatrical rigging system installation.

These systems require that both a “preceding” fire detection event, typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector, and an automatic sprinkler operation take place prior to the “action” of water introduction into the system’s piping. Activation of either the fire detectors alone, or sprinklers alone, without the concurrent {{operation of}} the other, will not allow water to enter the piping. Because water does not enter the piping until a sprinkler operates, double interlock systems are considered as dry systems in terms of water delivery times, and similarly require a larger design area.|$|R

"Water spray" [...] {{systems are}} operationally {{identical}} to a <b>deluge</b> <b>system,</b> but the piping and discharge nozzle spray patterns {{are designed to}} protect a uniquely configured hazard, usually being three-dimensional components or equipment (i.e. {{as opposed to a}} <b>deluge</b> <b>system,</b> which is designed to cover the horizontal floor area of a room). The nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers, and are usually selected for a specific spray pattern to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard (e.g. typical spray patterns being oval, fan, full circle, narrow jet). Examples of hazards protected by water spray systems are electrical transformers containing oil for cooling or turbo-generator bearings. Water spray systems can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases (such as hydrogen). Here the water spray is intended to cool the tank and its contents to prevent tank rupture/explosion (BLEVE) and fire spread.|$|E

When a system with oxygen partial pressure 0.48 bar is pressurized below about 70 msw (231fsw), the oxygen fraction is too low to support combustion (less than 6%), and the fire risk is low. During the early stages of compression and towards the end of decompression the oxygen levels will support combustion, and greater care must be taken.|$|R

Under these broad categories, the risks of fuel and oxidizer loading, installation of pyrotechnics, and similar hazardous operations are discussed. The many aspects for fire and rescue requirements are examined.

Although such safety barriers are widely employed to prevent or delay the initiation or escalation of fire domino effects, their inclusion in the modeling and risk assessment of fire domino effects has hardly been taken into account. In the present study, the dynamic evolution of fire protection systems has been investigated qualitatively using event tree analysis. To quantify the temporal changes and their impact on the escalation of fire domino effects, a dynamic Bayesian network methodology has been developed. The application of the methodology has been demonstrated using an illustrative case study, considering a variety of fire scenarios, target installations, and firefighting systems...|$|R

The unique symmetric geometry of the U-shaped gas management system facilitates the egress of gases, while minimizing flow into witness cells and reversed flow into the active cell.

In such applications, water spray is more frequently referred to as “water deluge”. A related study has also been carried out to investigate the attenuation of thermal radiation by water deluge on an oil tank fire.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part E : Journal of Process Mechanical Engineering [© IMechE] and is also available at: [URL] paper describes a scheme by which the explosion frequencies and resulting overpres- sures can be predicted for modules on an offshore platform. Given a leak of gas, the success and failure of the isolation, blow-down and <b>deluge</b> <b>systems,</b> which are designed to activate following a leak to mitigate the consequences, are considered. The frequency of each possible response to the leak is predicted using a conventional event tree and fault tree approach. Each scenario has a potential escape inventory, which together with the hole size distribution provides the escaping mass flowrate. Once the flowrate into the module is established, the wind conditions are used to determine the gas in air concentration build-up. The concentration profile with respect to time is linked to the ignition source probabilities, from which calculations can be made to assess the likelihood that an explosion will occur within a specific concentration range. The initial models assume that the gas concentration at any specific time is uniform within the locality of the leak. The work presented in this paper proposes an approach that determines the explosion probability dependent on the volume fraction of gas within the module and the likelihood of encountering an ignition source...|$|R

50|$|Eighty-four firefighters responded {{within five}} minutes of the crash {{occurring}} and emergency personnel were able {{to gain access to}} the Burnley tunnel on foot via a separate emergency tunnel linking the Burnley to the Domain tunnel. Fire hoses were carried through to the crash site while emergency vehicles were stationed in the Domain Tunnel. A number of fire appliances were transported contra-flow from the exit portal of the tunnel to the crash site. The <b>deluge</b> <b>system</b> was activated instantly and this was deemed by firefighters to have greatly aided in keeping the fire under control. The smoke extraction system functioned as planned and removed toxic fumes from the tunnel and out into the open air. Smoke was vented to the ventilation stack in Southbank.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{sea level}} test stand may be {{designed}} to restrain the rocket engine in either a horizontal or vertical position. Liquid rocket engines are usually fired in a vertical position because the propellant pump intakes are designed to draw fuel from the bottoms of the fuel tanks. The effect of the propellant weight on the thrust measurement system (TMS) must be accounted for as the engine is firing. The rocket exhaust is directed into a flame bucket or trench. The flame trench is designed to redirect the hot exhaust to a safe direction and is protected by a water <b>deluge</b> <b>system</b> that both cools the exhaust and also reduces the sound pressure level (loudness). The sound pressure level of large rocket engines has been measured at greater than 200 decibels — one of the loudest man-made sounds on earth.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{decisions}} in management of the industrial assets is to ensure the feasibility of life extension process for safety critical components when they reach end-of-life. Most of the existing life extension decision-making models are restricted solely to either “technical” or “economic” feasibility analyses {{that may lead to}} inaccurate results or incorrect conclusions. In this paper, a comprehensive life extension feasibility assessment framework by taking into account both the technical and economic considerations is developed. The proposed techno-economic model for life extension of safety critical elements consists of three phases: preparation, assessment, and implementation. The technical assessment part of the framework incorporates all aspects of data collection and review, screening and prioritization of safety critical elements, condition assessment, estimation of remaining useful life, and risk analysis, while the economic assessment part deals with cost-beneﬁt analysis. The decision to qualify a safety critical element for continuous operation beyond its service life is made based on a “life extension measure (LEM) ” which is calculated by combining two indexes of “equipment health condition” and “economic added-value” obtained respectively from the technical and economic assessments. The model is applied to support the life extension decision-making procedure for water <b>deluge</b> <b>systems</b> in offshore oil installations. The results of the study show that the model is highly capable of assisting asset owners to evaluate the technical and economic beneﬁts of extending the service life of components...|$|R
40|$|Department has {{completed}} the commitment represented above and proposes closure of this commitment. "Project Design Statement (PDS) for 12 - 44 Fire Protection Upgrade"-This commitment {{is a new}} commitment. The draft fire SAR/BIO module, coupled with several weapon-specific HARs, indicated the need to establish UV-activated deluge capability {{for a number of}} areas at the Pantex Plant involved in the assembly and disassembly of nuclear explosives. For the majority of affected facilities, the ongoing project to upgrade the capability and reliability of the fire detection and suppression systems has been expanded to include UV detection as the actuator of <b>deluge</b> <b>systems.</b> In this manner, the speed of detection and actuation can be rapid enough to prevent propagation of a fire. Rapid detection and suppression activation would prevent all fire scenarios except those initiated in very close proximity from potentially causing a thermal reaction in the high explosive of a nuclear weapon. However, the Building 12 - 44 cells were not encompassed by the current upgrade and a separate project will be required. As a result, the Department developed the enclosed PDS to initiate upgrading the fire detection and suppression system in Building 12 - 44 to provide UV-activated deluge capability. The completion of the physical modifications to Building 12 - 44 are expected to be completed December 2002 as stated within Commitment 4. 3. 9.

40|$|For {{the past}} fifty years or so, {{there has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} in the use of water based explosion suppression systems, designed to mitigate or reduce the impact of thermal explosions and their consequential overpressures, which may be as high as 2 MPa in outdoor environments. This level of interest has been heightened in more recent years due to a number of high loss explosion events including, Flixborough, UK (1974), Piper Alpha, North Sea (1998) and Buncefield, UK (2005). All of the previous research has focused on the suppression and mitigation proficiency of existing or new water <b>deluge</b> <b>systems,</b> which deploy sprays containing droplets 200 ≤D 32 ≤ 1000 μm. Where a high speed flame propagates through a region of spray containing such droplets, the flow ahead of the flame will hydrodynamically break up the droplets into fine mist, which in turn will act as a heat sink in the flame, with a resulting degree of suppression. These studies concluded that in most cases, existing <b>deluge</b> <b>systems</b> contributed to a global reduction in flame speed and thus caused a decrease in the resultant damaging overpressures. This present study however, is focused on the mitigation of slow moving deflagrations with resulting speeds of ≤ 30 m/s. A flame travelling at such low relative speeds will not possess the inertia to inflict secondary atomisation by hydrodynamic break up. Consequently, the droplets within the spray must be small enough to extract heat in the short finite moments that the flame and droplets interact (approximately 0. 03 ms for a representative 1 mm thick flame front). Previous theoretical studies have suggested that droplets, D 32, in the order of 10 μm - 20 μm will be required to successfully mitigate combustion without relying on further droplet break up. To date, there have been no other published experimental studies in this area. An innovative high pressure atomiser known as a Spill Return Atomiser (SRA) was selected, which contained a unique swirl chamber and was originally developed for decontamination and disinfection. The efficient atomisation of the SRA produced fine sprays containing droplets, D 32, 15 μm - 20 μm. A series of „cold trials‟ were conducted to further develop the single SRA, which manifested in the creation of several exclusive single and multiple spray options in counter, parallel and cross flow, with the direction of the propagating flame. These new configurations were supplied with deionised water at a liquid pressure of 13 MPa and were qualitatively analysed using High Definition (HD) imagery and quantitatively characterised using non-intrusive laser techniques. During the development stages of this study the SRA spray cone angle was increased from 34. 7 ˚ to 49. 2 ˚and the exit orifice flow rate was raised from 0. 295 L/min to 1. 36 L/min. The increase in flow rate provided a number of spray options ranging from 17 ≤D 32 ≤ 29 μm, with liquid volume flux of 0. 011 cm 3 /s/cm 2 - 0. 047 cm 3 /s/cm 2 and mean droplet velocity of 0 m/s - 21. 4 m/s, with the resulting characteristics giving way to complete explosion mitigation qualities. The second phase of this study was to conceive, design and build a suitable apparatus capable of producing slow representative flame speeds within the range of 5 m/s - 30 m/s. In excess of 250 mitigation „hot trials‟ were performed using the unique conformations produced during the „cold trials‟, whereby a configuration consisting of 4 x SRA‟s in cross flow (X/F) configuration, successfully and repeatedly, completely mitigated homogeneous methane-air mixtures throughout the whole flammable range E.

40|$|Metabolic control {{analysis}} (MCA) has become what it is, {{largely because the}} special organization of living cells led to rather specific questions. These questions focused {{on the role of}} enzymes, genes, and, in subsequent generalizations, on well-defined process activities. With an emphasis on the work by Heinrich and co-workers, the theory behind MCA is summarized in a way that leads naturally to its extensions to hierarchical systems, such as gene expression and signal transduction, and to control beyond the steady state. The analysis of the control properties of signal transduction cascades is reviewed with an emphasis on the relative importance of the protein kinases and the protein phosphatases. The two types of enzyme are both important for the amplitude of signal transduction, whereas phosphatases may be more important for the later phases of signal transduction and for its duration. Novel MCA of concentrations and fluxes that vary with time is explicated. It is concluded that the clarity and operationality of concepts such as control strength (now control coefficient) plus the clear theoretical frameworks provided by Heinrich and colleagues, should enable us greatly to reduce the Babylonian confusion that could otherwise occur in the data <b>deluges</b> of <b>Systems</b> Biology. © 2007...|$|R
