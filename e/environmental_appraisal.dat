40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>appraisals</b> of {{transport}} infrastructure plans are generally conducted {{in situations where}} {{there will be a}} step change, or an abrupt change, in noise exposure. While there has been a number of studies of response to step changes in exposure, and seven previous reviews of subsets of these studies, understanding of human response to a change in noise exposure remains limited. Building largely on these previous reviews, this paper examines the evidence that, when noise exposure is changed, subjective reaction may not change in the way that would be predicted from steady-state exposure-response relationships. The weight of evidence, while not incontrovertible, is that when exposure changes, responses show an excess response compared to responses predicted from steady-state exposure-response relationships. That is, there is a change effect in addition to an exposure effect - at least for road studies and at least where the change in exposure results from changes at the source. Further, there appears to be little, if any, adaptation of this excess response with time. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentFull Tex...|$|R

This broad policy development has manifested itself in a variety of ways, including the production of government guidance relating to sustainability appraisal and changes in best practice, each of which have influenced appraisal procedures in national parks. The wider implications of, and drivers behind, the evolution of appraisal procedure towards sustainability appraisal are thus identified and then discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{government}} has identified the land-use planning system, and development plans in particular, as potentially powerful instruments for integrating national sustainability objectives into strategic decision making at local levels. One method for achieving this {{is through the}} use of so-called 'sustainability appraisals', which are an extension of the established system of <b>environmental</b> <b>appraisal</b> used by planners since the early 1990 s. A national framework is outlined in Planning Policy Guidance Note 12. Local authorities are now expected to conduct an <b>environmental</b> <b>appraisal</b> of their development plans which covers sustainable development issues. However, little research has been conducted on the effectiveness of current guidance in meeting this aim. By evaluating the implementation of sustainability appraisals nationally, this paper suggests that while government advice to appraise is generally being applied, the actual use of key sustainability principles in practice is rather variable. It then discusses these findings in relation to the changing context of appraisals in the UK and other national planning systems. ...|$|E

In the UK, strategic environmental assessment {{has been applied to}} the full hierarchy of development plans in the form of <b>environmental</b> <b>appraisal.</b> Government guidance in England contains a forceful recommendation to local planning authorities to assess the environmental effects of proposed development plans by carrying out an <b>environmental</b> <b>appraisal</b> of their policies and proposals. This advice has grown in importance with the adoption of the European Directive on strategic environmental assessment. Research undertaken into current appraisal practice provides a context for the implementation of the Directive in England. The results show a broadly positive outlook towards strategic environmental assessment and a move towards using sustainability appraisal. Furthermore, they show other benefits from the process additional to assessing the core environmental impacts of the plan. However, it is clear that there remain major structural weaknesses and concerns {{in the manner in which}} strategic environmental assessment processes are implemented. Thus, more than two-thirds of the respondents to a survey stated that the appraisal had little or no influence on development plan objectives and policies, and nearly two-thirds believed that their plan would have developed in the same manner without any appraisal having been undertaken. <b>Environmental</b> <b>appraisal,</b> Sustainability appraisal, Development plans, Strategic environmental assessment, Evaluation de l'impact sur l'environnement, Evaluation durable, Schemas directeurs, Etude strategique de l'impact sur l'environnement, Wertschatzung der Umwelt, Wertschatzung der Nachhaltigkeit, Entwicklungsplane, Strategische Umwelteinschatzung, Valoracion de impacto ambiental, Valoracion de sostenibilidad, Planes de desarrollo, Evaluacion estrategica de impacto ambiental,...|$|E
