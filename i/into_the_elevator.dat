5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) complains that the carrot cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to have noticed him, stating that as a magician he could have slipped by.|$|E
25|$|In May 1997, Mattel {{introduced}} Share a Smile Becky, a doll {{in a pink}} wheelchair. Kjersti Johnson, a 17-year-old {{high school}} student in Tacoma, Washington with cerebral palsy, {{pointed out that the}} doll would not fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> of Barbie's $100 Dream House. Mattel announced that it would redesign the house in the future to accommodate the doll.|$|E

50|$|With {{most of the}} {{wreckage}} recovered, investigators found that fractures started in {{the roof of the}} cabin, a window then smashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> <b>the</b> rear fuselage then tore away, the outer wing structure fell, then the outer wing tips and finally the cockpit broke away and fuel from the wings set the debris on fire.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{generated}} from the cooling process is dissipated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hoistway. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> cab (or car) is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.|$|R
25|$|Momentum is a {{measurable}} quantity, and the measurement {{depends on the}} motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a frame of reference, in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.|$|E

Michael then faces two doors; one leads Michael to freedom {{and the chance to}} use the evidence found by his father to print the story of Jigsaw and the drug cartel. The other door reveals a Pighead costume and an offer to help people see the truth inside themselves, implying Michael can become another Jigsaw apprentice. The choice made is not revealed to the player.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, <b>the</b> areas leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate.

500|$|Don Draper, on the {{elevator}} to SCDP's offices with Megan, is coughing profusely, sweaty, and feverish. A flirty former lover, Andrea Rhodes, walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and starts to home in on Don before Don introduces Megan as his wife. Don tries to assuage a slightly perturbed Megan, who is upset over how many of Don's old flames they run into in Manhattan. Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although {{that was what the}} executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign. Don is enraged and admonishes Ginsberg for the act; Ginsberg doesn't seem to realize the seriousness of his transgression until Ken points out he {{was on the verge of}} being fired. Afterwards, Don returns home early to an empty house and collapses on his bed in a weakened state.|$|E
2500|$|Oliver Evans invented an {{automated}} flour mill {{in the mid}} 1780s that used control mechanisms and conveyors so that no labour was needed from the time grain was loaded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> buckets until flour was discharged into a wagon.

Or, [...] say, 'I don't like you.'" [...] She added, [...] "But I've always thought that, deep inside, Tony loves Ziva and Ziva loves Tony, but she's almost ashamed of saying it because he's so stupid. In the best of ways.

5000|$|Stands are emplaced on {{the floor}} of the {{drilling}} rig by the chain hand. When stands are being put onto the floor the chainhand is said to be [...] "racking stands". After the bottom of the stand is placed {{on the floor}}, the derrickman will unlatch <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and pull <b>the</b> stand in either with a rope or with just his arms. When stands are being put back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hole, the derickman will slam <b>the</b> stand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> to force them to latch. The chainhand will brace against the stand to control it when the driller picks it up. This is referred to as [...] "tailing the pipe" [...] as the chain hand will hold the pipe and allow it to semi-drag them back to the hole. The chain hand then passes it off to the tong hand, who then [...] "stabs" [...] <b>the</b> stand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pipe already in the hole.|$|R

NERV major Misato Katsuragi orders Asuka moved to the cockpit of Evangelion Unit 02 and placed {{at the bottom of}} a lake, then rescues Shinji from JSSDF troops. Determined to have Shinji defend NERV, Misato brings Shinji to Unit 01's bay doors, but is shot in the process.

500|$|Blue Shift {{begins in}} a similar manner to Half-Life, as Barney Calhoun rides a train through the Black Mesa {{facility}} to reach his place of work. After reporting for duty, Calhoun is instructed to assist in maintenance on a malfunctioning elevator. As Calhoun finishes repairs, however, Freeman's experiment takes place and results in a [...] "resonance cascade", causing massive damage to the facility and teleporting alien creatures <b>into</b> <b>the</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> is badly damaged and fails, sending Calhoun plummeting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> depths of Black Mesa.|$|R

5000|$|Dart's {{elevator}} utilized a set {{of grain}} bins. On top {{of them was a}} cupola that had equipment for weighing. Incoming grain was taken to the top by <b>the</b> grain <b>elevator</b> vertical assembly and discharged by gravity to storage after being weighed. Then sold grain to be transferred was taken from the storage bins. It was elevated again to the cupola, weighed out and dispensed to a barge, train or grain carriage vehicle. The" [...] marine leg" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was most important to these procedures and functions. Dart's innovations permitted the grain to be brought up with {{a set of}} scoop buckets attached to an endless loop belt. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> system undone and positioned <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> leg in different forms. One was the [...] "stiff leg" [...] within the building which brought up grain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grain <b>elevator</b> storage facilities from land based transports. Another was the [...] "loose leg" [...] brought up grain from ships and barges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grain <b>elevator</b> building. <b>The</b> [...] "loose leg" [...] was kept in a raised position within <b>the</b> grain <b>elevator</b> building when not in use. That required an unusual tower above the cupola roof. When a ship's cargo of grain was to be unloaded the [...] "loose leg" [...] was lowered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> belly interior of the ship's hull.|$|R

50|$|Destination {{dispatch}} is an {{optimization technique}} used for multi-elevator installations, which groups passengers for <b>the</b> same destinations <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same <b>elevators,</b> thereby reducing waiting and travel times {{when compared to}} a traditional approach where all passengers wishing to ascend or descend enter the same lift and then request their destination.|$|R
