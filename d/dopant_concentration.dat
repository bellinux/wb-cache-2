Higher <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> {{is used for}} pulsed lasers; lower concentration is suitable for continuous-wave lasers. Nd:YAG is pinkish-purple, with lighter-doped rods being less intensely colored than heavier-doped ones.

40|$|Determination of <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations</b> and mobilities {{is highly}} {{relevant}} for compensated silicon materials but crucial as standard models and standard methods fail {{due to the}} presence of multiple dopant species. Thus, an alternative method for direct determination of the net doping concentration p 0 is presented, which is based on measurements of the free carrier absorption (FCA) with the help of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and enables the majority carrier conductivity mobilities to be determined purely experimentally. Using a set of p-type FZ-silicon samples {{with a wide range of}} base resistivities, accuracy of the FTIR-FCA method for determining p 0 and of the iron-boron pairing association time method for determining the total boron concentration are evaluated in depth and found to be highly satisfactory. These methods are applied to a set of samples from three compensated silicon crystals, with large differences in the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the compensation ratio. Measurements of the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the majority carrier conductivity mobilities as a function of ingot position indicate that the Klaassen mobility model is a good description for the conductivity mobility in compensated p-type silicon for a wide range of <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Another way {{to speed}} the base transit time {{of this type of}} {{transistor}} is to vary the band gap across the base, e.g. in the SiGe base BJT the base of Si1−ηGeη can be grown with η approx 0.2 by the collector and reducing to 0 near the emitter (keeping the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> constant).|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturability}} of {{the materials}} depend on the thermal equilibrium solubility of the dopant in the base material. E.g., solubility of many dopants in zinc oxide is high enough to prepare the materials in bulk, while some other materials have so low solubility of dopants that to prepare them with high enough <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> thermal nonequilibrium preparation mechanisms have to be employed, e.g. growth of thin films.|$|E
40|$|Rare-earth ions are {{impurities}} providing low gain, reaching ~ 10 dB/cm, because electronic transitions {{within their}} 4 f subshell are parity forbidden, dictating low transition probabilities and cross-sections. Here we exploit the extreme inversion densities attainable in rare-earth-ion-doped microstructures {{in a host}} material, potassium double tungstate, that provides enhanced transition cross-sections and <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations,</b> thereby demonstrating a gain of 935 dB/cm in channel- waveguide and 1028 dB/cm in thin-film geometry, comparable to the best values reported for semiconductor waveguide amplifiers.

At moderate concentration, the yield of the photogeneration is virtually invariant regardless of the system and blend ratio because practically every primary excitation dissociates at a donor-acceptor site and the subsequent escape from the coulombic potential is virtually system-independent.

50|$|The Seebeck {{coefficient}} {{can change}} its sign in superlattice nanowires {{due to the}} existence of minigaps as Fermi energy varies. This indicates that superlattices can be tailored to exhibit n or p-type behavior by using the same dopants as those that are used for corresponding bulk materials by carefully controlling Fermi energy or the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration.</b> With nanowire arrays, it is possible to exploit semimetal-semiconductor transition due to the quantum confinement and use materials that normally would not be good thermoelectric materials in bulk form. Such elements are for example bismuth. The Seebeck effect could also be used to determine the carrier concentration and Fermi energy in nanowires.|$|E
50|$|Erbium-doped YAG (Er:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium lasing at 2940 nm. Its {{absorption}} bands suitable for pumping are wide and located between 600 and 800 nm, allowing for efficient flashlamp pumping. The <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> used is high: about 50% of the yttrium atoms are replaced. The Er:YAG laser wavelength couples well into water and body fluids, making this laser especially useful for medicine and dentistry uses; it is used for treatment of tooth enamel and in cosmetic surgery. Er:YAG is used for noninvasive monitoring of blood sugar. The mechanical properties of Er:YAG are {{essentially the same as}} Nd:YAG. Er:YAG operates at wavelengths where the threshold for eye damage is relatively high (since the light is absorbed before striking the retina), works well at room temperature, and has high slope efficiency. Er:YAG is pale green.|$|E

These doped systems exhibit a complex array of structures and properties dependent {{on the type of}} dopant, the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> and the thermal history of the sample. The most widely studied systems are those involving rare earth metal oxides, Ln2O3, including yttria, Y2O3. Rare earth metal cations are generally very stable, have similar chemical properties to one another and are similar in size to Bi3+, which has a radius of 1.03 Å, making them all excellent dopants. Furthermore, their ionic radii decrease fairly uniformly from La3+ (1.032 Å), through Nd3+, (0.983 Å), Gd3+, (0.938 Å), Dy3+, (0.912 Å) and Er3+, (0.89 Å), to Lu3+, (0.861 Å) (known as the ‘lanthanide contraction’), making them useful to study the effect of dopant size on the stability of the Bi2O3 phases.|$|E
50|$|In a semiconductor, the {{doping level}} also affects the Mott transition.

We achieved compensation for different ratio in the gas phase of diborane and phosphine, depending on their concentration. As a relevant result, we found that at constant boron concentration compensation occurs by using two different values of phosphine flow. This behavior can be described by a change of formation mechanism involving active dopants, defects and boron-phosphorus complex, that occurs in a different way depending on the <b>dopant</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The two compensation regimes are evidenced also by a different behavior under light soaking. Furthermore we found that photocurrent evolution under illumination is determined by two concurrent mechanisms: activation of dopant species and increase of defect densit...|$|R

50|$|One Japanese/East Indian {{consortium}} {{has focused}} {{specifically on the}} spectroscopic and stimulated emission characteristics of Nd3+ in transparent YAG nanomaterials for laser applications. Their materials were synthesized using vacuum sintering techniques. The spectroscopic studies suggest overall improvement in absorption and emission and reduction in scattering loss. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope observations revealed an excellent optical quality with low pore volume and narrow grain boundary width. Fluorescence and Raman measurements reveal that the Nd3+ doped YAG nanomaterial is comparable in quality to its single-crystal counterpart in both its radiative and non-radiative properties. Individual Stark levels are obtained from the absorption and fluorescence spectra and are analyzed in oredr to identify the stimulated emission channels possible in the material. Laser performance studies favor the use of high <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration</b> {{in the design of}} an efficient microchip laser. With 4 at% dopant, the group obtained a slope efficiency of 40%. High-power laser experiments yield an optical-to-optical conversion efficiency of 30% for Nd (0.6 at%) YAG nanomaterial as compared to 34% for an Nd (0.6 at%) YAG single crystal. Optical gain measurements conducted in these materials also show values comparable to single crystal, supporting the contention that these materials could be suitable substitutes to single crystals in solid-state laser applications.|$|E
5000|$|Polysilicon layers can be {{deposited}} using 100% silane at {{a pressure}} of [...] or with 20-30% silane (diluted in nitrogen) {{at the same}} total pressure. Both of these processes can deposit polysilicon on 10-200 wafers per run, {{at a rate of}} 10-20 nm/min and with thickness uniformities of ±5%. Critical process variables for polysilicon deposition include temperature, pressure, silane concentration, and <b>dopant</b> <b>concentration.</b> Wafer spacing and load size have been shown to have only minor effects on the deposition process. The rate of polysilicon deposition increases rapidly with temperature, since it follows Arrhenius behavior, that is deposition rate = A·exp(-qEa/kT) where q is electron charge and k is the Boltzmann constant. The activation energy (Ea) for polysilicon deposition is about 1.7 eV. Based on this equation, the rate of polysilicon deposition increases as the deposition temperature increases. There will be a minimum temperature, however, wherein the rate of deposition becomes faster than the rate at which unreacted silane arrives at the surface. Beyond this temperature, the deposition rate can no longer increase with temperature, since it is now being hampered by lack of silane from which the polysilicon will be generated. Such a reaction is then said to be 'mass-transport-limited.' When a polysilicon deposition process becomes mass-transport-limited, the reaction rate becomes dependent primarily on reactant concentration, reactor geometry, and gas flow.|$|E
