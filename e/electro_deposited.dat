40|$|Problem statement: This {{research}} {{attempts to}} optimize the parameters for pulse plating of silver on printed circuit board. The idea here is to use pulse plating technique which is metal deposition by pulsed electrolysis method.

Here the <b>electro</b> <b>deposit</b> is influenced by current density, silver concentration in the bath, applied current type. Pulse plating technique is used in double sided printed circuit board especially in the case of plated through hole technique.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{preparation}} and spectro - electrochemical characterization of electrochromic devices (ECD) combining inkjet - printed WO 3 as cathode and <b>electro</b> - <b>deposited</b> V 2 O 5 as anode. ECD {{were prepared for}} the first time with an optimized formulation of gel polymer electrolyte based on Bisphenol A ethoxylate dimethacrylate and Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (BEMA/PEGMA) encompassing the Room Temperature Ionic Liquid (RTIL, 1 - Ethyl - 3 - methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide) as solvent. The UV - VIS spectrum of ECD was recorded at different potentials during Li + insertion and de - insertion; additionally the Percent Trasmittance (T%) of ECD vs. time was investigated during repeated bleaching and coloring cycles allowing thus the esti mation of switching times and device stability. Due to the lower ionic conductivity and the apparent superior solvent permeability within WO 3 active layer, RTIL containing ECD showed slower switching times, but higher contrast with respect to the similar o nes with EC/DEC as solvent. These results indicate that the ECD containing environment - friendly RTIL electrolytes are suitable for applications requiring high contrast, high safety and moderately fast switching time...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{reviews the}} adhesion of bacterial on metal surfaces {{and the effect}} of metal’s surface roughness to the bacterial adhesion. The objectives of this research are, to study the adhesion of bacterial on metal surfaces (Stainless Steel (N 690), Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC) and Titanium) used in medical application {{and the effect of}} surface roughness on the wettability thus adhesion. Three types of bacteria were used for this research which was Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus attached on the individual metal which has eight different ranges of surface roughness, achieved by fabricating using <b>electro</b> <b>depositing</b> machine (E) and electropolishing (P) techniques. The adhesion test was done for 4 hours for each bacterium with different types of metal and surface roughness. After the adhesion test, the attached bacteria on metal surfaces were dyed using fluorescence dye, SYTO 9 and examined under the fluorescence microscope. The number of attached cells was counted and results were displayed as number attached per square area. Besides that, the absorbance and the colony forming unit (CFU) were also measured and the surface which gives highest optical density (OD) was identified. Finally, metal with highest attachment of bacterial, were analyzed under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to observe the bacterial cells attachments. Results obtained indicated that E. coli was a Gram negative bacterium while both B. subtilis and S. aureus were Gram positive bacteria. After the adhesion test, the OD reading for E. coli shows the highest reduction which is in the range of 6 % to 45. 7 % compared to others bacterial solution. CFU plating for E. coli at dilution factor 102 also showed the lowest among others after the adhesion test. Besides that, the adhesion of bacterial on Stainless Steel (N 690) recorded that, the highest attachment of all bacterial were on smooth surface (Ra = 0. 163 μm) and rough surface (Ra = 2. 910) with the total adhesion were 0. 1833 / μm 2 and 0. 1755 / μm 2 respectively. Meanwhile, adhesion on Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC) and Titanium shows similar trend where both B. subtilis and S. aureus provide the highest adhesion at the roughness 0. 110 μm and 0. 104 (smooth surface), respectively. On the other hand, the adhesion of bacterial on different metal with the same roughness (Ra = ~ 0. 15 μm) showed that B. subtilis like to adhere to Titanium surface with the adhesion value 0. 9601 /μm 2, while S. aureus and E. coli were adhered at Stainless Steel (N 690) and Stainless Steel (AV 220 SC), respectively with the total adhesion 0. 0679 /μm 2 and 0. 0704 /μm 2 each...|$|R
40|$|The Both {{the thermal}} spray and the {{electroplating}} coatings {{are widely used}} because of their high wear resistance combined with good corrosion resistance. In particular the addition of both micro particles or nano‐particles to the <b>electro</b> <b>deposited</b> coatings could {{lead to an increase}} of the mechanical properties, caused by the change of the coating microstructure. The thermal spray coatings were deposited following industrial standards procedures, while the Ni/SiC composite coatings were produced at laboratory scale using both micro‐and nano‐sized ceramic particles. All the produced coatings were characterized regarding their microstructure,mechanical properties and the wear resistance. The tribological properties were analyzed using a tribometer under ball on disk configuration at both room temperature and 300 oC.

Moreover, since the accentuated hydrophilic character of poly(5 -NH 2 - 1 -NAP) /PB also allows H 2 O 2 electrochemical reduction in inner active sites, issues concerning the amount of mediator electrodeposited on the electrode were also reflected in the observed results...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of the electro less deposition of chromium onto aluminum was investigated {{in order to improve}} non-printing element properties. It was determined that the electrochemical deposition of trivalent chromium was possible from alkaline solutions. The presence of chromium was confirmed by the EDAX procedure in three different laboratories. The influence of chromium on the wet ability of the nonprinting elements of the printing form was examined by drop spreading. Specimens were examined by pouring distilled water in drops onto the surface of the specimen. The picture of the drop was taken by a digital camera from two directions, in order to measure the diameter of the spreaded drop (a measuring gauge was recorded together with the drop) and contact angle. The chromium-treated samples showed increased wettability compared with the non-chromium-treated samples. Improvement of the non-printing elements was confirmed during a printing test that was performed under real printing conditions. The purity of the prints made by two types of printing forms was analyzed in two ways: based on densitometric measurements and based on statistical analysis of the scanned print. Both methods of analysis of the control prints showed that the control prints made from chromium-treated specimens were purer than the prints made from the non-chromium-treated specimens. Considering that all the conditions of making the printing forms and the printing conditions, except the electro less deposition procedure were the same, it could be concluded that the <b>electro</b> less <b>deposited</b> layer of chromium improved the printing properties of the offset printing form because of the increased wettability...|$|R
