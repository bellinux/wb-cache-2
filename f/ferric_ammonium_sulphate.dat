The experimental method {{is based on}} a two-stage reaction of Diltiazem with hydroxylamine and a ferric salt: in the first stage there is a hydroxamic acid formation; and, in the second stage there is a red colour complex ferric hydroxamate formation.

40|$|Abstract: There is an {{increasing}} interest in new strategies to determine as well as assessment of drugs in medical and pharmaceutical sciences. Herein we describe a simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective spectrophotometric method for determination of labetalol (LBT) hydrochloride based on the oxidation of the drug with <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> that yields a green colored product. The increase in absorbance of colored product is measured at 535 nm. All experimental parameters affecting the development of color are investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, Beer’s law is obeyed over the concentration range 10 - 200 µg/mL with molar absorptivity of 2. 13 × 10 3 L mol- 1 cm- 1. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the proposed method are 2. 71 and 8. 22 µg/mL, respectively. The intra–day and inter–day precisions and accuracy of the proposed method are acceptable with low values of standard analytical error. The data are in agreement with values obtained by standard British Pharmacopeia (BP) method.

40|$|Different {{types of}} biomass samples {{including}} fungi and algae were treated for their gold and cobalt uptake capacity. The performance of activated carbon and ion-exchange resins {{were compared with}} the metal uptake capacity of the biosorbents. Sargassum natans, a brown seaweed, exhibited a high gold uptake capacity outperforming the ion-exchange resin and equalling activated carbon. Algal biomass of Ascophyllum nodosum {{proved to be a}} very potent biosorbent for cobalt. While the temperature, agitation and biomass particle size did not affect the metal uptake process, the effect of pH was significant for both gold and cobalt uptakes. The optimum pH for gold uptake was 2. 5 and for cobalt, was 4 - 5. The kinetics of cobalt biosorption was relatively rapid (5 min) at the initial concentration of the metal in solution, 100 mg/L. The biosorptive uptake of gold required 2 h to reach equilibrium when the initial concentration of gold was 100 mg/L. None of the tested cations, such as K$ sp+$, Ca$ sp{ 2 +}$, Fe$ sp{ 2 +}$, Cr$ sp{ 3 +}$, UO$ sbsp{ 2 }{ 2 +}$, Ni$ sp{ 2 +}$, Zn$ sp{ 2 +}$, Ag$ sp+$, affected the gold uptake capacity of S. natans biomass under the optimum conditions. Anions, such as NO$ sbsp{ 3 }{-}$, SO$ sbsp{ 4 }{ 2 -}$, CO$ sbsp{ 3 }{ 2 -}$, PO$ sbsp{ 4 }{ 3 -}$, and Pb$ sp{ 2 +}$ suppressed the gold uptake somewhat. Under the optimum process conditions cations, except K$ sp+$ and Fe$ sp{ 2 +}$, and anions, NO$ sbsp{ 3 }{-}$ in particular, exhibited a pronounced negative effect on the cobalt uptake by A. nodosum biomass. Sequestered gold was eluted with a mixture of thiourea and <b>ferric</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution. Approximately 98 % of sequestered gold was eluted with 17 h in a batch contacting system at the optimum solids (biomass) -to-liquid ratio of 5 and pH of 5. At increased temperatures, the gold elution rate increased only slightly. Efficient desorption of cobalt was achieved using CaCl$ sb 2 $/HCL solution at pH 3. Cobalt elution time was quite short. Temperature affected neither desorption rate nor the equilibrium. The optimum solid-to-liquid ratio was 12 for desorption of cobalt from A. nodosum biomass. The gold taken up by the biosorbent was deposited in its elemental form. Available mathematical models, including the REDEQL 2 chemical equilibrium model, were tested for theoretical predictions of co-ion competition in attempt to better understand the biosorption mechanism.

Results: In order to delay the sporulation different levels of <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (10, 12 and 14 %) were added in culture media as nitrogen source for fungus. It was observed that addition of 14 % <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was the best concentration to add in culture during Solid State Fermentation (SSF) of substrate (Palm Kernel Cake (PKC) + Rice Bran) by Aspergillus niger to delay sporulation. Adding <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> also increased the digestibility of fiber in the Fermented Substrate (FS). In addition very low sporulation was observed even after 72 h of fermentation.
