Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements, and Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks.

[...] "They've given us license," [...] Kitsis said. [...] "I could be wrong, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first time anyone's shown Snow White with a sword, or pregnant."
