5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

25|$|Pointing: Several <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead {{ends of the}} bar or coil {{are reduced}} in size by swaging or {{extruding}} {{so that it can}} pass freely through the drawing die. Note: This is done because the die opening is always smaller than the original bar or coil section size.|$|E

Metres of development {{corresponds to}} the distance (in metres) traveled by the bicycle for one rotation of the pedals. Gain ratio is the ratio between the distance travelled by the bicycle and the distance travelled by a pedal, and is a pure number, independent of any units of measurement.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{this was}} at a lock or an artificially {{constricted}} part of the canal so that the boat had to pass within <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toll point unable to evade the toll. On canals where the fee was based on cargo weight it also put the boat in a convenient place to read the gauging mark height from the water line. On busy canals which were built with a towpath on either side such as the Birmingham Canal Navigations BCN New Main Line the toll house may have been built on an island between two constricted channels so that one toll point could collect from boats travelling in each direction. The BCN retains several of these islands, for example at Winson Green Junction.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011 Crabapple {{engaged in}} a week long {{performance}} art piece title Week in Hell. She locked herself inside a hotel room, covered every <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls with paper, and proceeded {{to spend the next}} five days filling every <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canvas with illustrations. The project was funded using Kickstarter, garnering 745 backers and over $20k in funds. In pitching the work she explained [...] "I'm interested in what happens when an artist leaves their studio, their cliches, and their comfort zone and draws beyond <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> their endurance." [...] Every day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endeavour was live-streamed to all backers. During the week she was continuously visited by friends and fellow artists. A book documenting the project was released March 2012 also titled Art of Molly Crabapple Volume 1: Week in Hell.|$|R
25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far better than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
25|$|The {{repeated}} wave {{of attacks}} {{carried out by}} the Italians would render irrelevant the air-raid alarm system since it would no longer be clear if the sirens were announcing the beginning or the end of an attack. Furthermore, they used delayed-fuse bombs designed to pass through the roof and then explode inside the building and a new type of bomb which exploded with a strong lateral force, so as to destroy things and persons within a few <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. The bombings affected all the city and the bombers didn't attempt to destroy military targets. On the night of 18 the working class districts were badly hit. The Italian bombers dropped 44 tons of bombs, and there were more than 1,000 civilians dead (Beevor: 1,000 dead and 2,000 wounded; Preston: around 1,000 dead; and Thomas: 1,300 dead and 2,000 wounded).|$|E
25|$|The {{font size}} was {{measured}} not in points but in pitches that is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> letters per one <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typed line. As a result, 12-pitch fonts (12 letters per inch) were actually smaller than 10-pitch fonts (10 letters per inch), and roughly {{corresponded to the}} 10pt and 12pt traditional typographic font sizes.|$|R

40|$|Arteriolar {{patterns}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submucous plexus {{were studied}} {{in all areas}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog's stomach and in <b>the</b> first <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duodenum. There appeared to be no poverty of plexus, although {{in some cases the}} vessels were somewhat smaller in <b>the</b> pyloric part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser curvature than elsewhere. Mucosal arteries arose from the plexus, and none appeared to have an extramural origin. In man, on the other hand, there is a poverty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submucous plexus in the 'ulcer region', i. e. in <b>the</b> incisural region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser curvature and in <b>the</b> first <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duodenum, associated in some cases with mucosal end arteries <b>of</b> extramural origin. <b>The</b> absence <b>of</b> these features in the dog, which does not suffer from spontaneous chronic ulceration, lends further support to the view that they play a role in <b>the</b> aetiology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease in man...|$|R

2500|$|An {{innovative}} feature {{which is}} more usually associated with 20th-century guns was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same}} time slightly swaged down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] {{class of}} torpedo boats were steam powered with a {{partially}} enclosed hull. They were not true submarines but were semi-submersible; when ballasted, only the smokestack and few <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull were {{above the water}} line. CSS Midge and CSS St. Patrick were David-class torpedo boats.

2500|$|The [...] "L.A.P.D. Special" [...] had a dull parkerized {{military}} finish {{instead of}} the more usual high gloss blue finish. The barrel was 18 {{and a half inches}} long, as opposed to the twenty <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civilian version. The advantages of the Ithaca Model 37 Shotgun over the Winchester, Mossberg and Remington models were that the Ithaca weighed a pound less, and could be used with equal ease by right or left-handed shooters due to the unique bottom ejection port and loading chamber it used. The Ithaca 37 is still in use today as the main shotgun carried by LAPD officers, and has been in use since the 1940s.|$|E

2500|$|At 12:25pm on 22 September 1907 {{the nearly}} {{completed}} Principessa Jolanda was launched before a large audience of onlookers, {{government officials and}} foreign journalists. After travelling down the slipway, the ship immediately became unstable and heeled sharply to port. Efforts by tugboats and shipyard workers to rescue the situation, including lowering the anchors to starboard to counteract the movement, were unsuccessful. After 20 minutes the vessel's list was such that it began taking on water through openings in the upper decks. She soon capsized with her funnels a few metres above and parallel to the water.

2500|$|Damaged power cords of {{portable}} air conditioners cause many electrical fires and about 350 deaths per year. To combat this, each portable air conditioner {{sold in the}} United States is now required to have a leakage current detector interrupter (LCDI) or ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protective device built into its power cord. The device can be integral with the power plug, or a separate module within 12 <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plug. An LCDI cord has a fine wire mesh around the conductors, and circuitry to detect current leaking from the conductors to the mesh, which {{would happen if the}} cord were damaged or frayed. The plugs are normal NEMA 5-15, 5-20, 6-15, 6-20 or 6-30 plugs, depending on the air conditioner, typically molded-on plugs.

2500|$|Nebraska {{received}} the opening kickoff and halfback [...] returned it 27 {{yards to the}} Stanford 48-yard line. The drive culminated in a short rush by fullback Ike Francis, and with the extra point, the Cornhuskers took a 7-0 lead on the first possession. Stanford drove into Nebraska territory, but fumbled the ball away on the 28-yard line. The Cornhuskers punted it away and the Indians mounted a touchdown drive to equalize the score. In the second quarter, Nebraska recovered a fumbled punt return and on the subsequent possession scored on a 33-yard pass. Stanford responded immediately, and Albert passed to Hugh Gallarneau for a 40-yard touchdown {{to tie the game}} at 13. Albert made the extra point kick to take the lead. In the third quarter, the Indians drove 76 yards to within <b>inches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposing goal line, but the Cornhusker defense held and took over on downs. Nebraska punted the ball away and Kmetovic returned it 40 yards for a touchdown. Albert made the extra point and Stanford {{went on to win the}} game, 21-13.|$|E
