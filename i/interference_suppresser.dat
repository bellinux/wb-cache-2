In this thesis, two techniques, the Engine Noise Cancellation (ENC) technique and the Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) technique, are developed to resolve the common {{problems associated with the}} development of the hands-free cellular phoneâ€”the engine noise interference and the acoustic echo. Moreover, this thesis proposes a more sophisticated development called the Integrated Hands-Free Cellular Phone System which not only features a hands-free, engine noise free, and echo free cellular phone system, but also provides a quiet driving environment for the driver. In addition, this integrated system incorporates the existing car stereo system to work as a multi-functional system. This thesis concentrates {{on the development of the}} ENC and AEC for the integrated system to operate in hands-free phone mode. The active noise control will be briefly discussed in order to develop the Music <b>Interference</b> <b>Suppresser</b> (MIS) which contributes important functions to the AEC process. All systems, algorithms, and methods proposed in this thesis are tested using real speech data obtained from real experimental setups. The experimental and simulation results reinforce that the two techniques and associated algorithms developed in this work are practical and successful. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
