40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in <b>false</b> <b>twisting</b> of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This letter {{deals with}} the {{observed}} development of (<b>false)</b> <b>twist</b> in fibres subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. A simple theory in terms of forces and moments is presented from which both the torque and the rate (amount) of twist can be correlated with the viscoelastic properties of the fibre. In a recent paper of Calil et a 1 (1980) a theory was presented {{to account for the}} experi-mentally observed development of (<b>false)</b> <b>twist</b> in fibres subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. This theory is based upon an energy consideration, because, as the authors state: ‘the torque is easily explained by an energy argument, but more difficult in terms of forces and moments’. The theory neither permits the calculation of the angular dependence of the twisting torque nor the rate (amount) of twist. In figure l(a) a simpie method for fatigue testing by rotation of a bent fibre is shown. According to Calil et a 1 (1980) the deformation of the fibre is considered in a frame rotating with the same speed as the fibre; see figure l (b). In this frame the cross-section A remains stationary, but the end B is moved around a circle (without rotation of the cross-section itself) in a direction opposite to the original direction of rotation. There-fore: in this frame the deformation of the fibre can be considered as due to the super-position of two identical periodic pure bending deformations showing a phase difference of;r/ 2 rad. (FrGm these considerations it is dear that the amount of dissipated energy as mentioned by Calil eta 1 (1980) is too small by a factor two.) Alternatively the deformation j bi Figure 9.

I mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark, on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder's body, as the circle is described, the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side, and comes up again when the circle is completed; and this gives the <b>false</b> appearance of <b>twisting,</b> which, in the case of spontaneously revolving plants, deceived me for a time.

With the increasing demand of light, thin and comfortable knitted fabrics, it is desirable to have wool yarns in medium to high counts with better yarn evenness, less hairiness, soft handle and reasonable tenacity, etc. By literature review, ring spinning continues to predominate in worsted yarn manufacturing industry because of its high quality of yarns and good flexibility in materials and yarn count. Many modifications have been conducted to enhance the control of fibers in spinning triangle and reduce yarn hairs, but nearly have no improvement on yarn soft handle and evenness. However,over ten years ago, a modified technology on the ring frame was developed by employing a <b>false</b> <b>twisting</b> device and a strand separator, which was named as Nu-torqueTM or low-torque or low-twist spinning. Since then, the technology has evolved in five versions. The low-twist cotton yarns exceed other types of modified ring spun yarns with respect to softer handle, lower residual torque, and outweigh the conventional ring yarns in aspects of higher tenacity, lower hairiness, etc. Previous versions of low-twist worsted yarn technology have produced low-twist worsted yarns in median and coarse count, however, some problems were found such as worse yarn optical evenness, more neps and tight wrapper fibers, as well as lower yarn tenacity, among which, the wrapper fibers give rise to obvious "bar effect" on the dyed knitted wool fabrics. Hence, this thesis is aimed at investigating these problems and exploring possible solutions from both theoretical and practical points of views. The surface structure of 24 Nm low-twist worsted yarns are examined under Microscope Lecia M 165 in details and classified into five types including three kinds of wrapping structures and two kinds of unwrapped structures. In particular, the tightly wrapping structures take up almost 60 % on the low-twist yarns. These tightly wrapping structures not only bring about quite compact yarn structures resulting in harsh handle of yarns and fabrics,but also deteriorate yarn optical evenness resulted from obviously smaller diameters than conventional yarn structures and higher variations. Using high speed camera system, the formation of wrapper fibers on the low-twist yarn surface has been investigated. It is found that the abrasion between yarns or the protruding fiber ends and the upper false-twister or the lower false-twister, the fiber security of yarns in A zone, as well as the false-twisting effects exerted by the two false-twisters, have effects on the wrapper fiber formation; more importantly, the wrapper fibers have roots in the long protruding fiber ends in A zone on the low-twist spinning system, namely, the hairiness of 3 mm and longer of the yarn segment between the spinning triangle and the false-twister. Besides, the bulked yarn segment resulted from excessive twists in A zone is reckoned as the reason for the formation of the curved yarns with tight wrapper fibers. Hypothesizing that the structure of yarn segment in A zone on the low-twist spinning system {{is similar to that of}} ring-spun yarns of a high twist without buckling, a hairiness model of such ring yarns is beneficial to understand the origin of hairiness and wrapper fibers as well as the formation of neps. The number of all fiber ends in the out-most layer of ring-spun yarn cross-section, which are already or have potentials to become hairs, is first defined as maximum hairiness in unit length of yarn. Based on Brown and Ly's work on the number of fiber ends in twist-less fiber assembly, a statistical model of the maximum hairiness of ring yarns has been established by considering yarn twist geometry and the contributing surface layer for hairs. In particular, fiber length, fiber cross-section and the number of fibers have been revised with the consideration of yarn twist. Moreover, Hairiness contribution factor (h 0) is proposed for model development as the ratio of the number of fiber ends having potentials for hairiness and the total number of fiber ends in yarn cross-section. From the developed model, it can be seen that the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, or the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone of the low-twist spinning system, relates to fiber length distribution, fiber diameter, yarn count, yarn twist,measured hair length etc. Moreover, the present model provides the length of the predicted maximum hairiness, whereas previous related models fail to do so. The verification by experiments demonstrates that the predicted values of 1 mm and longer are in the same order of magnitude as the measured values, which are more accurate than the predicted values from other related models. Whereas, the predicted maximum hairiness of 3 mm and longer, that is, the long protruding fiber ends, is almost 1 ~ 2 order of magnitude higher than the measured S 3 values. Alternatively, there are some other ways to further reduce the number of long protruding fiber ends in A zone, like combining Siro-spinning or Solo-spinning with low-twist spinning, because it is generally believed that surface fiber trapping between the two substrands in Siro-spinning triangle or among several substrands in Solo-spinning triangle contributes to the significant decrease of yarn hairiness. Accordingly, the maximum hairiness model of ring yarns is revised for Siro-spun yarns and Solo-spun yarns with respect to fiber trapping and yarn geometry, respectively. Also, experiments have been carried out to verify the developed hairiness models. As aforementioned before, the fiber security of the yarn segment in A zone also influence the wrapper fiber formation and the resultant yarn surface; and the degree of fiber ends being tucked into yarn bodies directly determines the number of protruding hair of yarns. Whereas, the existing related parameters only describe fiber ends already protruding out of yarns. Similar to the theoretical limit of yarn evenness CVlim, the real yarn hairiness can approach but is always lower than the maximum hairiness of ring yarns. A Relative Hairiness Index (RHI) is accordingly proposed, which has two forms:the theoretical one and the actual one. The theoretical RHI is the ratio of maximum hairiness of certain type of yarn to the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can theoretically reveal the effectiveness of different spinning methods in tucking fiber ends into yarn bodies; and the so-called actual RHI is the ratio of the measured yarn hairiness and the maximum hairiness of ring yarns, which can actually demonstrate the degree of fiber ends potential for hairiness being tucked into yarns resulted from various spinning system or their spinning parameters. Both the theoretical RHI and the actual RHI demonstrate that Siro-spinning can most effectively tuck fiber ends into yarn bodies, therefore Siro-spun feeding will give rise to the least long protruding fiber ends. Additionally, winding is employed to mimic the abrasion that yarn will experience, and it is found that the hairiness of ring yarns obviously increases with the increasing winding times and reaches a plateau after the fourth winding, therefore the number of hairs of yarns after four-time winding, is termed as stable hairiness. By analyzing the increment rate of the actual RHI of various yarns in the states of cop, cone and stable, which are the yarns experience zero-time, one-time and four-time winding, respectively, Siro-pun yarns also present the best fiber security. Hence, Siro-spun feeding with a normal roving gap of 14 mm is combined with the lately 5 th version of low-twist spinning system for further reducing the wrapper fibers and improving the surface of low-twist yarns. However, aiming at yarn evenness and tenacity, as well as proper twists in A zone to avoid bulking as described before, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns (36 LT) is first systematically optimized by means of the combination of Fractional Factorial Methodology and Response Surface Methodology, respectively. With a twist multiplier reduced by around 15 %, the optimized 36 LT yarns show comparable tenacity and similar hairiness, but still a bit worse evenness and more neps than the conventional yarns. Actually, the number of neps (+ 140 %) has been reduced about one order of magnitude on the present low-twist yarns by comparing with that of yarns produced on the previous versions of low-twist spinning system. The blackboard evenness of the optimized 36 LT yarns exhibits half grade lower than the conventional yarns with a twist multiplier higher by about 15 %, but half grade higher than the counterparts with the same level of twist multiplier, respectively. Then, the spinning parameters of 36 Nm low-twist yarns with double-roving feeding (36 LT+Siro) are also optimized by using Response Surface Methodology. The tightly wrapped structures on the optimized 36 LT yarns only account for 8. 9 %, whereas the ones on the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarns even reduce to 5. 8 %. Moreover, nearly no tightly wrapped structures with a curved yarn body are found on the two optimized yarn surfaces. Therefore, the optimized spinning parameters of low-twist spinning system, as well as the incorporation of Siro-spinning not only facilitate the reduction of wrapper fibers on the resultant yarns, but also provide suitable twists in A zone to avoid producing buckling and curved yarn segments. Nevertheless, the optimized 36 LT yarn has an obviously higher actual RHI than the conventional ring yarns, and it presents similar increment rate when enduring abrasion to that of its counterpart, which indicates that the optimized 36 LT yarns possess low fiber tucking and security, in other words, the fiber deformation resulted from false-twisting effect fails to be held in yarns. But the actual RHI of the optimized 36 LT+Siro yarn and its increment rate by abrasion are markedly lower than the ones of the conventional yarn, particularly, its increment rate is even similar to that of Solo-spun yarns. It is demonstrated that the fiber tucking and security of low-twist yarns can also be improved by integrating Siro-spinning system. Finally, using the Kawabata Evaluation System of Fabric (KES-F), the knitted fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns are examined in terms of fabric surface property, tensile and shear, as well as bending and compression. There are no statistically significant differences in surface property,tensile, shear, bending, compression and bursting strength between the low-twist fabrics and the conventional fabrics made of the worsted yarns with a higher twist multiplier by around 15 % (at a significant level of 0. 05). However, the low-twist fabric possesses better pilling performance and air permeability, but lower thermal conductivity than its counterpart. Besides, nearly no "bar effect" is found on the resultant fabrics made of the optimized 36 LT yarns. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

40|$|Abstract—In recent five decades, {{textured}} yarns of polyester fiber produced by <b>false</b> <b>twist</b> method {{are the most}} important and mass-produced manmade fibers. There are many parameters of cross section which affect the physical and mechanical properties of {{textured yarns}}. These parameters are surface area, perimeter, equivalent diameter, large diameter, small diameter, convexity, stiffness, eccentricity, and hydraulic diameter. These parameters were evaluated by digital image processing techniques. To find trends between production criteria and evaluated parameters of cross section, three criteria of production line have been adjusted and different types of yarns were produced. These criteria are temperature, drafting ratio, and D/Y ratio. Finally the relations between production criteria and cross section parameters were considered. The results showed that the presented technique can recognize and measure the parameters of fiber cross section in acceptable accuracy. Also, the optimum condition of adjustments has been estimated from results of image analysis evaluation...|$|E

To over-come this deficiency, other researchers have tried to lower the degree of crys-tallinity of this fibre by either tension annealing or blending it with polyethyleneterephtha-late and polystyrene. These physical or chemical modifications have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of enhancement of the textureability of polypropylene. Considering the importance of BCF polypropylene yarns, in this research, the effect of blending polypropylene with 12. 5 and 25 % of polyamide 6 on {{the bulk of the}} final bulked continu-ous filament (BCF) yarn has been investigated. The results show that although both crimp contraction and crimp modulus increase with the temperature and pressure of hot air during texturing, but blending polypropylene with even 25 % of polyamide 6 does not enhance the textureability of BCF yarns. Also, the reduction in the crystallinity of the yarns does not lead to any improvement in the textureability of the polypropylene BCF yarns. polymer blending; polypropylene; polyamide 6; continuous filament...|$|E

40|$|A {{low torque}} {{spinning}} method has been recently developed by integrating the ring spinning process with false twisting techniques. As {{a result of}} <b>false</b> <b>twist</b> and true twist, a novel single yarn of low torque and soft handle is generated. Based on the similar spinning principle, this paper proposed a 2 -step spinning method, which is composed of twisting-anduntwisting operation and {{can be considered as}} a variant of the low torque spinning method. The proposed spinning method separates the false twisting process into twisting and untwisting processes which are combined in one step in the low torque spinning method. In this paper, physical properties of yarns produced by the proposed spinning method were evaluated and compared with the conventional yarns. Influences of various spinning parameters on the properties of 2 -step yarns were also examined. Furthermore, a systematic study of the physical properties of the 2 -step yarns and resultant fabrics with respect to the conventional and low torque ones was carried out. The experimental results showed that the 2 -step yarns exhibit slightly higher tenacity, lower wet snarl and much less hairiness than the conventional yarns, which, however, are inferior to the low torque yarns, particularly the evenness. The fabrics made by the 2 -step yarns show the softest handle feeling, best airpermeability and moderate spirality angle with acceptable pilling resistance. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to flat multifilament yarn. Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different <b>false</b> <b>twist</b> levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; yarn fineness, filament fineness, cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done.
