5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an <b>injection</b> <b>ram</b> or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

An injection molding machine operates under such different operating conditions as different molds and materials. This causes the velocity dynamics to vary significantly and consequently results in poor control performance for a typical PI controller. This paper discusses a computer control system for <b>injection</b> <b>ram</b> velocity using a realtime fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The rules of FLC are optimized by analyzing the phase plane characteristics. The membership functions are determined based on the 2 (k) factorial design technique.

40|$|<b>Injection</b> <b>ram</b> {{velocity}} to a {{large degree}} determines the melt injection rate during the injection phase in an injection molding process, and has strong influences on the molded part quality, such as shrinkage, warpage, and impact strength. An injection molding machine operates under strongly different operating conditions, such as different set-point profiles, barrel temperatures, molds and materials. This causes the ram velocity dynamics to vary significantly, and consequently results in poor control performance for a typical PID controller. This thesis presents a computer control system for the <b>injection</b> <b>ram</b> velocity using a real-time fuzzy logic controller (FLC), together with a fuzzy feedforward controller (FFC). The rule base of the FLC is optimized by analyzing the phase plane characteristics and, the optimal membership functions of FLC are based on the 2 k factors design technique. The experimental results reveal that the controller has improved performance over the conventional PID controller, in the response speed, set-point tracking ability, noise rejection, and robustness. In this study, the non-linearity and time-varying characteristics of the <b>injection</b> <b>ram</b> velocity have been investigated by an experimental model as well as a simplified physically-based model. Finally, the possibility of applying an adaptive fuzzy controller (AFC) to the ram velocity control is explored in this study. An AFC is designed and tested for the control of ram velocity during filling. The experimental results show that the controller worked in the cup mold, but failed in the modified flat mold. A possible reason for this may be the strong effect of different molds on the dynamics of ram velocity and the use of cup mold data for the adaptive rate y and the input and output variables fuzzy sets. The application of AFC to injection molding may give a direction for further study...|$|E
5000|$|Discodance was a Dutch {{record label}} which {{released}} rare dancetracks on cd-single {{in the late}} 1980s to the mid-1990s.

Discodance made about 300 copies of every single and were unable to recover each copy. As a result, every extant Discodance single {{can be considered a}} [...] "collectable". Their most sought-after releases are from Kylie Minogue and the Swedish singer Carola Häggkvist.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were con-ducted which involved the exogenous administra-tion of progesterone and estrogens to 15 ovariec-tomized ewes. Plasma LH levels were measured by radioimmunoassay and the occurrence of behavioral estrus was determined by vasec-tomized <b>rams.</b> <b>Injection</b> of estradiol benzoate (EDB) either at 2 or at 16 days {{after the end of}} progesterone priming produced 2 effects. In-itially, a depression (0 - 12 hr post injection) of plasma LH, followed by an LH surge (12 - 24 hr post injection). EDB (50 tig) injected at 2, 8 and 14 days after the end of progesterone priming resulted in typical LH surges to all 3 injections. However, the behavioral responses decrease...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} special design {{features}} help {{the engine to}} develop [...] A special fuel <b>injection</b> unit has <b>ram</b> tubes of larger cross section and 2510 longer {{than those of the}} regular production design. Individual exhaust pipes of a tuned length empty into large collector pipes and no mufflers are used. No cooling fan is required or used, and the water pump speed is reduced 30% by the use of a smaller crankshaft pulley. A small, 5-ampere generator is used in conjunction with a lightweight aircraft type battery In addition to the aluminum water pump mentioned previously, the engine cooling system consists of an aluminum radiator mounted forward of the driver, and two oil cooler radiators mounted one {{on each side of the}} main radiator.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for injecting errors into a FDDI {{token ring}} network is disclosed. The error injection scheme operates by fooling a FORMAC into thinking it sent a real frame of data. This {{is done by}} using two RAM buffers. The RAM buffer normally accessed by the RBC/DPC becomes a SHADOW RAM during error injection operation. A dummy frame is loaded into the shadow RAM in order to fool the FORMAC. This data is just like the data {{that would be used}} if sending a normal frame, with the restriction that it must be shorter than the error injection data. The other buffer, the error <b>injection</b> <b>RAM,</b> contains the error injection frame. The error injection data is sent out to the media by switching a multiplexor. When the FORMAC is done transmitting the data, the multiplexor is switched back to the normal mode. Thus, the FORMAC is unaware of what happened and the token ring remains operational...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{object of}} this study was to advance ovarian {{activity}} and the appearance of the first oestrus of Awassi ewe lambs. 60 ewe lambs at age of 220 ± 10 days with an average body weight 30 ± 1 kg, were divided into three groups, each one contained 20 subjects. The first group (HH) was treated with 1000 I. U i. m. /head hCG, the second group (PP) was treated with 500 I. U i. m. /head PMSG, while the third group (CC) as a control group was treated with saline solution (1 ml i. m. /head). After the first injection, all the treatments were repeated two times at 10 -days interval with the same dosage. To mark ewe lambs having estrus behavior, after the first <b>injection,</b> 6 teaser <b>rams</b> were introduced. The estrus behavior was controlled daily for 54 days. The ewe lambs in the different treatment groups showed estrus as follows: HH 17 / 20 (85 %); PP 18 / 20 (90 %); CC 4 / 20 (20 %) respectively. From our results we could be concluded that the use of high doses of hCG or PMSG can possibly advance puberty of Iraqi Awassi ewe lambs...|$|R
40|$|Increase of the {{intestinal}} permeability (IP) can occur for local pH reduction and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) release by bacteria; {{it can cause}} local and systemic inflammation with consequences for animal health. Changes of IP can be evaluated by a non-invasive test (never used in ruminant) based on oral dosage of lactulose -usually not fermented or absorbed- and its recovery in blood. This study aimed to induce intestinal damage (ID) in rams, by challenge of indomethacin, and to monitor it using the lactulose test (LACT) and blood indices. With a change-over design, 4 rams were subjected to 4 intramuscular injections (12 hours from each other) of saline (C) or indomethacin (T). Two hours after last <b>injection,</b> the <b>rams</b> were administered orally 30 g of lactulose. Blood samples were collected daily, for analysis of a metabolic profile and every 2 hours during the LACT for lactulose recovery in blood. Data were evaluated by ANOVA using the MIXED procedure (SAS Inst.). Three out of 4 rams in T showed -at different time- a blood lactulose peak, confirming clinical symptoms of diarrohea and blood in faeces. T rams also showed oxidative stress (e. g. reactive oxygen metabolite 17. 3 vs 11. 5 mg H 2 O 2 / 100 mL in T and C respectively P< 0. 01 60 h post treatment), and inflammatory response: rise of positive acute phase proteins (e. g. haptoglobin 1. 2 vs 0. 1 g/L in T and C respectively, P< 0. 01 36 h post treatment) and drop of negative acute phase reactants (e. g. cholesterol, albumin and paraoxonase P< 0. 05). A good agreement between blood inflammatory indices and lactulose levels in blood was evident: T ram with low ID also showed almost an unchanged blood profile. We {{were not able to}} establish whether these results are the consequence of mucosa inflammation or LPS translocation in bloodstream or both. To clarify these hypotheses further experiments are recommended also in other ruminants, in particular dairy cow fed highly fermentable diets...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a welcome}} innovation, the â€œinstantâ€• DPmTcMAA kit {{preparation}} {{as described in}} the liter ature (1, 2) proved to have two disadvantageswhen performed in this and another laboratory (3). First, the particles are not actually preformed but must be adjusted before <b>injection</b> by <b>ramming</b> them through a small bore needle. This both necessitates microscopic assay and creates a broad particle dis tribution range. Second, the refrigerated particles aggregate with time and become difficult to size suit ably for injection. These disadvantagescan be remedied by adding a small amount of nonionic surfactant, polysorbate- 80 USP, to the preparation. This affords a 100 % pre formed particle stable for more than 4 months, com parable tissue distribution and biological half-times with those described (1), and decreased sensitivity of agitation and thermal incubation steps, resulting in greater batch reproducibility. To producethe particles,a 30 -ml vial containing a 1 -in. bar magnet is affixed to a rectangular-based stand on top of an inexpensive, immersible, pneu matic stirrer. Five milliliters of a 1. 0 % HSA and 10 % sodium acetate solution along with 19 ml water for injection are aseptically transferred into the vial. After these solutions are mixed, 1. 0 ml of 0. 5 % stannous chloride in 1. 0 N HCI is added. This solu tion is mixed for 2 mm, after which 1. 5 ml of 10 % polysorbate- 80 solution is added. The stand is then lowered into a constant-tempera ture water bath (80 Â ± 1 Â°C) until one-fifth of the vial is immersed. The solution is stirred at maximum for 12 mm. Thestandisremovedandtheparticles mixed for 5 mm more. The particles are assessed and dispensed in 1 -ml lots into I 0 -mi sterile vacutainer tubes. These tubes are then refrigerated (the most convenient), frozen, or lyophilized before use. The particles should be both macro- and microscopically examined until the investigator has documented his particle preparation for stability and particle reproducibility. To label the refrigerated particles, add from 10 â€...|$|R
