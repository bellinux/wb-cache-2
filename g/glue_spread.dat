He became professor of political economy in the University of Siena in 1881; and he held a similar appointment in the University of Padua (1891-1903), and University of Torino (1903-1932). He {{was elected to the}} Accademia dei Licei (1901) and appointed to the Italian Senate in 1919. His work draws {{on a wide range of}} predecessors: Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, Adolf Wagner and Luigi Cossa, who was his teacher. With this background and on the basis of research on landholding in the British Museum he developed an original deterministic theory of economic development. It is based on the premise that the relative scarcity of land leads to the subjugation of some members of society by others, a mechanism that works differently in different stages of development. This concept was developed in a large number of books, many of which were translated into foreign languages. They had an indirectly influenced their interpretation of American history. Achille Loria is also seen as a forerunner of socio-legal studies (see International Institute for the Sociology of Law).Loria was one of the earliest critics of Marx's ideas, and as such his views were ridiculed by Engels. An original conception of Loria was his idea that <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> on the wings of aircraft would be able to trap birds in such quantities that it would solve the world food problem.|$|E
30|$|It can {{be learned}} from Table  4 that THR for {{combustion}} to 180  s did not vary from the amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> with the value below 1.5  MJ/m 2.

40|$|Liquefaction of spent {{creosote-treated wood}} was studied to {{determine}} the technological practicability of its application in converting treated wood waste into resin adhesives. A total of 144 plywood panels were fabricated with experimental variables included 2 phenol to wood (P/W) ratios in liquefaction, 6 resin formulations (3 formaldehyde/liquefied wood (F/LW) ratios × 2 replications), 6 glue applications (2 <b>glue</b> <b>spreads</b> × 3 assembly times), and 2 panel replications. Average shear strength (235. 6 psi) and wood failure (70. 5 %) for resin adhesives prepared from liquefied wood at P/W ratio of 2. 0 {{were significantly higher than}} the shear strength (184. 7 psi) and wood failure (53. 1 %) for that at P/W ratio of 1. 5. On average, F/LW ratio of 2. 25 yielded substantially lower shear strength and wood failure than that of F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75. Differences in shear strength and wood failure between F/LW ratios of 2. 0 and 1. 75 were not significant. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that F/LW ratio interacted with P/W ratio to affect wood failure, but not shear strength. As shown in Fig. 2, at P/W ratio of 1. 5, the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in the lowest wood failure. On the contrary, at P/W ratio of 2. 0, the F/LW ratio of 2. 25 resulted in highest wood failure and the F/LW ratio of 2. 0 yielded the lowest wood failure. On the basis of wood failure, the resins prepared from liquefied wood at P/W ratio of 2., reacted at F/LW ratio of 2. 25, and applied the glue at the rate of 90 pounds per 1000 square ft of double glue line met the standard of vacuumpressure soak cycle for exterior glueline (PS- 1 - 66).

40|$|The {{sandwich}} panels {{with the}} mineral wool core contain mineral wool lamellas. The end connections of lamellas {{have not been}} studied much and {{it is unclear how}} different end connection types affect to the total strength of the whole panel. European product standard EN 14509 : 2013 describes two different test methods for shear strength. With them, it is possible to examine the shear strength of sandwich panels and mineral wool lamellas. However, these test methods do not work well when the thickness of panel is over 100 mm. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the functional test method was developed to test the shear strength of the thicker lamellas. The previous tests and EN 14509 : 2013 part A. 3 were the basis for the development. The developed test method is usable with glass wool and also with the stronger stone wool. After the test method development, different end connections were studied in the sec-ond part of the thesis. Their strength was compared with the strength of full lamella. Both, mechanical end connections and glue end connections were examined. The me-chanical end connection types meant the shaped connections which were made by mill-ing and cutting. Other possible mechanical end connections are also included. All the test specimens were handmade. The results of tests show that the glue end con-nections are stronger than the mechanical end connections. The stiffness of the glue end connections was higher.

40|$|Plant {{surfaces}} {{covered with}} crystalline epicuticular waxes {{are known to}} be anti-adhesive, hardly wettable and preventing insect attachment. But there are insects that are capable of gluing their eggs to these surfaces by means of proteinaceous secretions. In this study, we analysed the bonding region between the eggs of Crioceris asparagi and the plant surface of Asparagus officinalis using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The wettability of the plant surface by egg secretion was compared with that by Aqua Millipore water, aqueous sugar solution and chicken egg white. Furthermore, the force required to remove C. asparagi eggs from the plant surface was measured, in order to evaluate the egg's bonding strength. Mean pull-off force was 14. 7 mN, which is about 8650 times higher than the egg weight. Egg <b>glue</b> was observed <b>spreading</b> over the wax crystal arrays on the plant cladophyll and wetting them. Similar wetting behaviour on the A. officinalis surface was observed for chicken egg white. Our results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of insect egg adhesion on micro- and nanostructured hydrophobic plant surfaces is related to the proteinaceous nature of adhesive secretions of insect eggs. The secretion wets superhydrophobic surfaces and after solidifying builds up a composite, consisting of the solidified glue and wax crystals, at the interface between the egg and plant cuticle...|$|R
40|$|Fibrin glue is an {{excellent}} template for cellular migration and {{has been shown to}} be an effective delivery system for cultured autologous keratinocytes. We have investigated whether fibrin glue has any benefit on the percentage of epithelial cover when cultured autologous keratinocytes are sprayed onto a freshly debrided wound bed. Three pigs were used for this study. This provided a total of 18 full thickness, vertically orientated wounds, each 4 cm in diameter and isolated in PTFE chambers to prevent re-epithelialisation from the wound margins. Eight wounds were sprayed with cultured autologous keratinocytes suspended in 2 ml culture medium and eight wounds were sprayed with cultured autologous keratinocytes suspended in 1 ml of the fibrin/aprotinin component of Tisseel fibrin glue (Baxter) mixed with 1 ml of culture medium. In the latter group the thrombin component of the fibrin glue kit was applied to the wound bed immediately prior to grafting. The remaining two wounds were used as controls and sprayed with either culture medium or fibrin glue without cells. Epithelial cover was calculated in whole-wound biopsies at 3 weeks using image analysis, histology and immunohistochemistry. The cell suspension in fibrin <b>glue</b> appeared to <b>spread</b> more evenly over the wound surface, with no pooling in the inferior aspect of the wound. However, mean epithelial area at 3 weeks in the fibrin group was 1. 6 cm 2 per wound compared with 1. 8 cm 2 for the non-fibrin group, as measured by image analysis of digital photographs. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P= 0. 802). This surprising result was confirmed by histological analysis of the wound biopsies, with a good correlation between histological and image analysis data (R= 0. 967).

With the help of the birds, Muggle-Wump removes the carpet from the floor, as well as all of the tables, chairs, and other objects in the house, and uses Mr. Twit's glue to stick the objects upside-down to the ceiling, leaving the floor absolutely bare. By doing this, the Twits will believe that they have been turned upside-down, as they will be standing on what looks like the ceiling of their house, and will stand on their heads to be the right way up. To keep their heads glued to the ground, two birds will put a small amount of glue on the Twits' heads right before they enter the house, so that when they stand on their heads, they will be stuck.Just as the preparations for this trick are finished, the twits return home. Everything goes as planned, the Twits believed they've been turned upside down and so stand on their heads to counter it, only to be stuck to the bare floor.

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] this work, a durable and easy to handle thin film microextraction (TFME) device is reported. The membrane is comprised of poly(divinylbenzene) (DVB) resin particles suspended in a high-density polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) <b>glue,</b> which is <b>spread</b> onto a carbon fiber mesh. The currently presented membrane was shown to exhibit a substantially lesser amount of siloxane bleed during thermal desorption, while providing a statistically similar extraction efficiency toward {{a broad spectrum of}} analytes varying in polarity when compared to an unsupported DVB/PDMS membrane of similar shape and size which was prepared with previously published methods. With the use of hand-portable GC-TMS instrumentation, membranes cut with dimensions 40 mm long by 4. 85 mm wide and 40 ± 5 μm thick (per side) were shown to extract 21. 2, 19. 8, 18. 5, 18, 4, 26. 8, and 23. 7 times the amount of 2, 4 dichlorophenol, 2, 4, 6 trichlorophenol, phorate D 10, fonofos, chloropyrifos, and parathion, respectively, within 15 min from a 10 ppb aqueous solution as compared to a 65 μm DVB/PDMS solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber. A portable high volume desorption module prototype was also evaluated and shown to be appropriate for the desorption of analytes with a volatility equal to or lesser than benzene when employed in conjunction with TFME membranes. Indeed, the coupling of these TFME devices to hand-portable gas chromatography toroidial ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-TMS) instrumentation was shown to push detection limits for these pesticides down to the hundreds of ppt levels, nearing that which can be achieved with benchtop instrumentation. Where these membranes can also be coupled to benchtop instrumentation {{it is reasonable to assume}} that detection limits could be pushed down even further.

Deformations of plywoods {{are caused by}} many reasons, such as wood structure (the course of wood fibres), plywood construction (the construction balance as for size and material regularity), the moisture of processed veneers and boards, <b>glue</b> <b>spread,</b> actual pressing process, the storage and climatization of finished plywoods. Basic technological parameters affecting the shape stability of plywoods were analysed, such as parameters of the hydrothermic pre­pa­ra­tion of raw material, parameters of veneer drying and the moisture of peeled veneers after drying as well as pressing parameters. At the conclusion, recommendations to improve the shape stability of plywood sheets are presented...|$|E
30|$|Fire retardancy of melamine-modified urea–formaldehyde resin (MUF) {{containing}} intumescent fire-retardant ammonium polyphosphate (APP) (MUF/APP) {{was conducted}} by cone calorimeter with surface treatment of medium density fiberboard (MDF). The {{results showed that the}} six MUF resins synthesized with different F/(M + U) and M/U molar ratios containing APP significantly improved the fire retardancy of the MDF by prolonging ignition time, reducing heat release rate and total heat release, and decreasing mass loss rate. The fire-retardant properties of the six synthesized MUF/APP acted differently even though each MUF resin containing the same mass ratio of APP. The melamine content in the MUF should not be too high, otherwise it would decrease the fire-retardant properties of MUF/APP. Based on this study, the higher the APP amounts, the better the fire-retardant performance of the resin was. The fire retardancy of MUF/APP increased with the increase in the amount of glue that spread on the material surface. However, only the amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> exceeded 250  g/m 2, whereas the ability of MUF/APP in inhibiting heat release did not increase significantly any longer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Wood I-joists {{is a kind}} of wood-based {{engineering}} material which was widely used in wood construction. As it is in fact, the property of I-joists are influenced not only by shear stress but also by a part of normal stress when they are taking into application. In this study, the effects of different factors were evaluated on the tensile property of the wood I-joists. The factors include the depth of the tanks on the flanges, the amount of <b>glue</b> <b>spread</b> and adhesive type. The method of orthogonal test was used in the process of the experiment design, and tensile test were taken during the experiment at the aim of testing the property of the I-joists using a universal mechanical testing machine. Ultimately, it has been discovered that the factor of adhesive type is the most influential one in the three factors which had been listed. So this paper offers the optimal fabrication technology of the I-joists to make it is possible for the increase of reliability when wood I-joists are taken into application...|$|E
