40|$|The recent {{measurement}} by Bignami {{and co-workers}} {{of the magnetic}} field of a neutron star {{for the first time}} gives a value that differs by about two orders of magnitude from the expected value. The speculation has been that the nuclear matter in the neutron stars exhibits some exotic behaviour. In this note we argue that this exotic behaviour is an anomalous statistics obeyed by the neutrons, and moreover these considerations lead to a value of the magnetic field that agrees with the observation. The same considerations also correctly give the magnetic fields of the earth and Jupiter. Very recently Bignami and co-workers have been able to observe the magnetic field of an isolated neutron star for the first time 1 and get the value 8 × 10 10 Gauss, which differs by a few orders of magnitude from the expected value 2. We would like {{to draw attention to the}} fact that infact the value just observed was deduced on the basis of the anomalous statistics obeyed by the neutrons in neutron stars, which behave as a degenerate Fermi gas 3, 4, 5.

The direct way to determine the mobility curves is by experiments. However the measurements are rather delicate and very sensible to the specific specimen one is dealing with.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{high-resolution}} angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy {{study of the}} evolution of the electronic structure of FeSe 1 -xSx single crystals. Isovalent S substitution onto the Se site constitutes a chemical pressure which subtly modifies the electronic structure of FeSe at high temperatures and induces a suppression of the tetragonal-symmetry-breaking structural transition temperature from 87 K to 58 K for x= 0. 15. With increasing S substitution, we find smaller splitting between bands with dyz and dxz orbital character and weaker anisotropic distortions of the low <b>temperature</b> <b>Fermi</b> surfaces. These effects evolve systematically as a function of both S substitution and temperature, providing strong evidence that an orbital ordering is the underlying order parameter of the structural transition in FeSe 1 -xSx.
