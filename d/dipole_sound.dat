40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of porous surface on the {{turbulent}} noise generated by a blunt trailing-edge of a flat plate is investigated. The three-dimensional turbulent flow over the flat plate (Rec= 1. 3 × 105 and M= 0. 06) is computed by incompressible large eddy simulation (LES) based on the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, while the acoustic field is calculated by the linearized perturbed compressible equations (LPCE) coupled with LES solutions. The porous surface is applied to a small, selected area near the trailing-edge, where the Kármán vortex shedding and eddy scattering produce <b>dipole</b> <b>sounds.</b> The computed {{results show that the}} trailing-edge with porosity ε= 0. 25 and permeability (normalized) K*= 0. 01 yields a reduction of tonal peak by 13 dB for zero angle of attack (α= 0 º), via breaking not only in the streamwise direction but also in the spanwise direction the spatial correlation of the wall pressure fluctuations (Rpp) near the trailing-edge. For the separated flow case (α= 5 º), the same configuration of the porous surface is found to weaken the pressure fluctuations at the trailing edge. It results in 3 - 10 dB noise reduction over a wide range of frequency, via reducing the separated flow region over the upper surface of the plate. I...|$|R
50|$|A stereo <b>dipole</b> is a <b>sound</b> {{source in}} an Ambiophonic system, made by two closely spaced {{loudspeakers}} that ideally span 10-30 degrees. Thanks to the cross-talk cancellation method, a stereo dipole can render an acoustic stereo image nearly 180° wide (single stereo dipole) or 360° (dual or double stereo dipole).|$|R
25|$|Manipulation of the {{equation}} yields the lower two equations for the <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> power of both lift and drag. Each time a vortex is shed, the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the vortex is shed on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole {{would be expected to}} be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{figure on}} the right shows a number of {{turbulent}} sound spectra measured at various speeds. The frequencies were Strouhal number scaled with U and the sound levels were scaled with the <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> power rule of U6 over a speed range of 3 to 1. The data fit was quite good, confirming dynamic similarity and the dipole model. The slight discrepancy in level and frequency overlap suggests that both the dimensionless force and the Strouhal number had weak dependence on the Reynolds number.|$|E
25|$|When two {{vortices}} {{are equidistant}} from the ring, one being beyond {{and the other}} approaching, the net circulation around the ring is zero; the null point for the flow oscillation. Each vortex creates a circular (ring) flow field whose axis varies slightly from the vertical as it passes. The figure suggests that {{the main component of}} the force on the physical ring is {{in the direction of the}} jet flow. If the vortex is a true ring (all parts are in phase), a <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> field directed along the jet axis is created.|$|E
40|$|Mitigating low-frequency {{noise in}} a small ducted fan system such as hairdryer is still a {{technical}} challenge. Traditional duct lining with porous materials work ineffectively due to the limitation of its thickness and length of small domestic product with ducted fans. This study presents a passive approach to directly suppress the sound radiation from the fan housed by a short microperforated panel covered with a shallow cavity backing. The noise suppression is achieved by the sound cancellation between sound fields from a fan of a <b>dipole</b> nature and <b>sound</b> radiation from a vibrating panel via vibro-acoustic coupling and by sound absorption in micro-perforations to widen the stopband. A two-dimensional theoretical model, capable of dealing with strong coupling among the vibrating micro-perforated panel, sound radiation from the <b>dipole</b> source, <b>sound</b> fields inside the cavity and the duct is developed. Through modal analysis, {{it is found that}} the even modes of the panel vibration are very important to cancel the sound radiation from the dipole source. Experimental validation is conducted with a loudspeaker to simulate the dipole source, and good agreement between the predicted and measured insertion loss (IL) is achieved.

The oscillation frequency and the damping rate of this mode is studied for different harmonic confinements and temperatures. The measured damping rates close to the collisionless regime are found to be in good agreement with Landau damping. For increasing hydrodynamicity of the cloud we observe an increase of the damping.

Attention is given to the contribution of the shock to sound from the viewpoint of energy conservation; the shock emerges as the source of only the quantity of entropy...|$|R
25|$|Blowing {{over the}} edge of a jug or bottle can create a nearly pure tone of low frequency. The driving force is the flow over the jug edge so one might expect an edge tone <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> field. In this case, The {{curvature}} and roundness of the edge makes a strong edge tone unlikely. Any periodicity at the edge is likely submerged in the Class III feedback from the jug volume. The unsteady edge flow sets up a classical Helmholtz resonator response in which the interior geometry and the jug neck determines the resultant frequency. A resonance equation is shown below.|$|E
25|$|In a {{rectangular}} jet, the instability can show as asymmetric cell distortions. The asymmetry sends waves {{back to the}} nozzle which sets up a Class III feedback loop and a strong periodic <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> field; it is called screech tone. Powell first described the phenomenon and because of application to military aircraft and potential structural fatigue, much subsequent work has been done. The sound field is sufficiently intense for it to appear on a shadowgraph {{as shown in the}} figure on the right (from M.G. Davies) for {{a rectangular}} supersonic jet. The dipole nature of the source is clear by the phase reversal {{on either side of the}} jet. There is lateral motion of the shock cells that gives the dipole its axis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipe organ}} {{is another example}} of a {{potentially}} <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> source being driven as a monopole source. An air jet is directed at a sharp edge setting up flow oscillations as in the edge tone. The edge is part of a generally cylindrical tube of length L. An example is shown in the figure on the right. The unstable jet drives fluid alternately into the tube and out. The streamlines clearly are distorted from those of the free edge tone. There is a stagnation point opposite the source. The dashed lines, colored in red, are those most strongly modified. The red streamlines in the tube are now augmented by the oscillatory flow in the tube, a superposition of resistive and reactive dipole flow and resistive acoustic flow.|$|E

It is shown {{that in the}} saturated moist air turbulence {{in addition to the}} Lighthill's quadrupole and the <b>dipole</b> sources of <b>sound</b> related to stratification and temperature fluctuations, there exist monopole sources related to heat and mass production during the condensation of moisture. We determine acoustic power of these monopole sources. Performed analysis shows that the monopole radiation is dominant for typical parameters of strong convective storms. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with the main observed characteristics of infrasound radiation by strong convective storms such as total acoustic power and characteristic frequency...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the aeroacoustic {{analysis}} of a three-dimensional pantograph model, through the employment of an innovative analytical approach and a 3 D numerical modeling. Specifically, the proposed analytical approach, aimed to predict the noise emission, {{is based on a}} modified formulation of the Smith and Chow's formula. Namely, by considering the entire landing gear structure as a sum of cylindrical elements, each cylinder noise has been individually calculated by the formula, as a result, based on the superposition principle, the whole noise is obtained; considering that the pantograph can also be considered as a sum of cylindrical elements, this formula, initially developed for aircraft landing gears, has been optimized and calibrated for {{the purpose of the present}} study. Because of, the analytical formula does not take obviously into account several effects related to the noise generation mechanism, a 3 D numerical aeroacoustic model of the pantograph was needed. Specifically, the theoretical background adopted is the Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy, an evolution of the well-known Lighthill acoustic analogy. The latter consists in the substitution of the noise generating surface with a distribution of <b>dipole</b> punctual <b>sound</b> sources, whose intensity is proportional to the temporal variation of fluid dynamic quantities acting in that point. As a result, a more detailed characterization of the noise spectrum can be provided. The analytical and numerical results have been then compared in terms of sound pressure levels and a well spectral contents, to themselves and to available experimental data...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the unsteady flow field inside a slat cove was performed to identify possible sound source generation mechanisms. Tests were carried out on a swept constant chord half-model with a stored chord length of 0. 45 m. Experiments were conducted in the 2. 0 m x 1. 4 m wind tunnel facility of the Technical University of Berlin at an angle of attack of 4 °, 8 °, 12 ° and 16 ° and free stream velocities ranging from 20 m/s up to 35 m/s. The slat cove flow field was investigated by Particle Image Velocimitry (PIV) while the radiated sound was recorded with a single microphone. Both measurements were conducted in a synchronized manner to allow a correlation between the flow field and the sound pressure. An inspection of instantaneous PIV images shows a free shear layer emanating from the slat cusp with discrete vortices further downstream. The shear layer impinges on the inner slat surface and some vortices get trapped inside the recirculation area. Based on a simplified form of the Lighthill-equation sound source terms are calculated. A <b>dipole</b> type <b>sound</b> source distribution is found along the shear layer with decreasing strength further down the shear layer. In addition the vortex shedding frequency of the shear layer vortices is estimated from the instantaneous PIV data. The shedding frequency has a Poisson-like probability distribution with center frequencies ranging from 4 kHz to 10 kHz. The mean shedding frequency scales linearly with the mean velocity of the shear layer. It could not clearly be verified that vortex shedding from the slat cusp is the cause for low frequency broad band noise. For a particular configuration several discrete tones can be observed. It is suspected that this tonal noise originates from the junction between the slat and the fuselage...|$|R
25|$|Measurements {{showed that}} the vortex whistle was created by a {{rotating}} asymmetric vortex which created a rotating force vector in {{the plane of the}} exit and a rotating <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> field. The phenomenon of swirl instability has been shown to occur in other situations. One was the flow separation on the upper side of delta-shaped airfoils of high speed aircraft (Concorde), The angle of attack of the leading edge resulted in a swirl flow that became unstable. Another is the flow within cyclone separators; the swirling flow there occurs in an annular region between two tubes. The flow reverses at the closed end of the outer tube and exits through the inner tube. Under certain conditions, the flow in the reversal region becomes unstable, resulting in a period rotating force on the outer tube.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating <b>dipole</b> <b>sound</b> field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

40|$|Suppressing the {{ducted fan}} noise at low {{frequencies}} without varying the flow capacity {{is still a}} technical challenge. This study examines a conceived device consisting of two tensioned membranes backed with cavities housing the axial fan for suppression of the sound radiation from the axial fan directly. The noise suppression is achieved by destructive interference between the sound fields from the axial fan of a <b>dipole</b> nature and <b>sound</b> radiation from the membrane via vibroacoustics coupling. A two-dimensional model with the flow effect is presented which allows {{the performance of the}} device to be explored analytically. The air flow influences the symmetrical behavior and excites the odd in vacuo mode response of the membrane due to kinematic coupling. Such an asymmetrical effect can be compromised with off-center alignment of the axial fan. Tension plays an important role to sustain the performance to revoke the deformation of the membrane during the axial fan operation. With the design of four appropriately tensioned membranes covered by a cylindrical cavity, the first and second blade passage frequencies of the axial fan can be reduced by at least 20 dB. The satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory demonstrates that its feasibility is practical. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{scaling law}} for {{aerodynamic}} <b>dipole</b> type of <b>sound</b> from constrictions in low speed flow ducts by Nelson and Morfey is revisited. A summary of earlier published results using this scaling law is presented together {{with some new}} data. Based on this, {{an effort to find}} a general scaling law for the sound power for components with both distinct and non-distinct flow separation points are made. Special care is taken to apply the same scaling to all data based on the pressure drop. Results from both rectangular and circular ducts, duct flow velocities from 2 to 120 m/s and sound power measurements made both in ducts and in reverberation chambers are presented. The computed sound power represents the downstream source output in a reflection free duct. In particular for the low frequency plane wave range strong reflections from e. g. openings can affect the sound power output. This is handled by reformulating the Nelson and Morfey model {{in the form of an}} active acoustic 2 -port. The pressure loss information needed for the semi-empirical scaling law can be gained from CFD simulations. A method using Reynold Average Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations is presented, where the required mesh quality is evaluated and estimation of the dipole source strength via the use of the pressure drop is compared to using the turbulent kinetic energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} sound wave {{scattering}} by a lattice of small inhomogeneties characterized by impedance is considered. The scattered field is obtained as a sum of scattered fields of monopole and dipole. It is shown, that the intensive monopole scattering appeared only when reactive components of impedances of a sc tterers and radiation field compensate each other. The insulation properties of a lattice are studied. It is shown, that a scattering lattice, for which one the spatial period does not exceed half of acoustic wavelength, is effective insulator of a <b>sound.</b> Influence of <b>dipole</b> scattering on <b>sound</b> insulation of a lattice is estimated. It is known [1, 2], that some small inhomogeneties in medium (for example, the gas bubbles in a liquid) intensively scatter sound waves, impinging on them.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade wind noise has with few {{exceptions}} consistently generated a constant or even growing level of customer complaints to automotive companies world-wide. This can partly be explained by a relatively greater focus on engine, power-train and tire noise {{combined with a growing}} need to reduce weight in future cars. One class of wind noise problems commonly referred to as air-rush noise relates to turbulent pressure fluctuations caused by separated or vortical flows, which is addressed in this thesis. Sound generation and to some extent sound propagation are here evaluated from incompressible flow fields, since the unsteady flow hydrodynamics at low Mach numbers is often the dominant sources of sound. A temporal form of Curle's equation is used in these evaluations. It is shown that the noise level measured inside the compartment of a production vehicle has a <b>dipole</b> character. Accordingly, <b>sound</b> generation is evaluated from the dipole terms in the acoustic analogy and, for one specific case, the radiated sound is evaluated by the surface integral of the same terms. Three different cases are investigated, ranging from the laminar flow past an open two-dimensional cavity to the turbulent flow past a representative ground vehicle. It is shown that the dipole terms in Curle's equation can with sufficient accuracy be predicted for the regions of interest even for the full vehicle case. A potential problem is highlighted, which is that, even if the acoustic source magnitudes are correctly predicted in an incompressible field, the sound directivity may be erroneous due to distortions in the pressure field and small differences in the flow field for flows with few but dominant structures...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the fundamental aerodynamic sound generation mechanisms involved in human voice production. A full scale dynamic model of the larynx was used. The experimental facility allowed jet flows through orifices of different laryngeal-like geometries to be investigated, for various acoustic loads and working gas mixtures. The broadband sound generation by stationary jets was first investigated. Empirical non-dimensional relations for the amplitude and the spectral character of the sound radiated from confined jet flows were developed, utilizing an original spectral decomposition procedure. The results confirmed previous findings relative to the basic mechanisms involved, and provided improved models {{that could be used}} to predict the spectrum of the broadband noise generated at the glottis during phonation. Broadband noise generation in pulsating flows was also investigated. It was found that the quasi-steady approximation did not always yield accurate predictions for the broadband component of the radiated sound during the opening and closing stages of one glottal cycle. Otherwise, the periodic component of the radiated sound in pulsating flows, with and without a strong acoustic loading, was predicted well using the quasi-steady approximation within the accuracy limitations of the experimental facility. A species of jet tone was observed in the case of a stationary jet flow through an orifice with divergent walls. This was postulated to be caused by a dynamic stall phenomenon. The geometry, wall motion, and mechanical properties of the model did not replicate those of a human subject with great fidelity. However, many basic features were reproduced which allowed the verification of the quasi-steady approximation often used in voice production models to be verified over a range of flow conditions. The experimental results help clarify the role of monopole, <b>dipole,</b> and quadrupole <b>sound</b> sources involved in translaryngeal flows, and provide useful insight on basic flow-sound interactions within the human larynx. ...|$|R
40|$|Fans {{are often}} used in {{equipment}} such as home appliances andelectronic equipment where the margin of profit is small butcustomers demands on a low noise level are high. Therefore,methods for predicting the noise emitted by an applicationincluding one or several fans are desirable in order toimprove, accelerate and {{reduce the cost of}} low-noise design. The Noise Shaping Technology (NST) has been developed withinthe EC-project NABUCCO in order to fulfil the aboverequirements on a prediction method. According to NST, thenoise source (not necessary a fan) is described by one orseveral noise descriptors, CSSs, and the correspondingtransmission paths through the structure described by one orseveral transfer functions, ACFs. In this thesis, theapplicability of NST is evaluated on a cabinet for electronicequipment where small axial cooling fans constitute the primarysources of the airborne sound. As an axial fan is a complex source of sound,simplifications are necessary when modelling its acousticproperties. Therefore, the sound radiation of an axial fan infree space was examined by expanding the generated soundpressure field into spherical harmonics. The conclusion on asource model for the cabinet example, where the fans are moreor less In-duct mounted, is a modified single axial dipole. Themodel is expected to be valid in the entire frequency range ofinterest except in the mid-frequency range where the modaldensity is low. In order to improve the source model in thisfrequency range, a future model based on a rotating <b>dipole</b> isproposed. The <b>sound</b> power of a small axial fan is measured in an ISO 10302 test-rig. In order to take account of flow conditions,acoustically transparent ducts have been developed. These shallbe attached to the test-rig when measuring the sound power ofthe fan. A simple but practical method of how to correct thesound power for the baffling effect of the test-rig has alsobeen developed. Finally, the sound power can be converted intodipole force, which is the airborne CSS corresponding to thesingle axial dipole model. The corresponding airborne transfer function (ACF), i. e.,from dipole force at the source point to sound pressure at thereceiver point, is measured reciprocally by taking use ofLyamshevs reciprocity relation. From multiplication of the CSS and the ACF, the soundpressure can be predicted. The prediction shows quite goodagreement with the measured values.
