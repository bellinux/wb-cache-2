5|$|In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) {{allows a}} {{supposedly}} deceased Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to re-visit a pivotal event {{in his youth}} that he since regrets. Picard changes the past, but upon returning to the present he finds that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the man he became. He returns once more {{to the past and}} returns it to the way it originally took place. Picard wakes up in the present, unsure if the events took place or if it was {{as a result of his}} injury.|$|E
5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|Mostow, an {{immigrant}} from Uzbekistan {{with a history}} of involuntary commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi {{signed his}} first {{contract}} {{as a senior}} team player. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, {{who were willing to}} pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, {{it was the only time}} the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.|$|E
5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed the corruption of the NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m {{was eight}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} personal best; <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the first 14-year-old {{to cover the}} distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time was a world record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> cry, and he had never forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E
25|$|Inter won the 2010 Champions League final 2–0 against Bayern Munich on 22 May 2010. This was Zanetti's 700th {{appearance}} for Inter, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{the first}} player to captain an Italian club to a treble of the Scudetto, Coppa Italia and Champions League.|$|E
25|$|Nureyev {{was above}} all {{a stickler for}} {{classical}} technique, and his mastery of <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a model for {{an entire generation of}} dancers. If the standard of male dancing rose so visibly in the West after the 1960s, it was largely because of Mr. Nureyev's inspiration.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. [Looking at the CHAPLAIN {{over his}} spectacles] Ye-es, but I {{wanted to tell}} you about that, special. He had hopes they'd have let her come and see him, but they haven't. Of course he asked me questions. I did my best, but I couldn't tell the poor young fellow a lie, with him in here--seemed like hitting him. But I'm afraid <b>it's</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> worse.|$|R

25|$|Well, {{the racism}} wasn't there, the {{homophobia}} wasn't there—as much. Even the drug use {{was a little}} more tolerated. But really I think that Booker felt he was being taken seriously in Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> think of himself differently and improved the quality of his music. He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{said that}} {{partly due to}} the stress of {{performing}} stand-up he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he never drank or took drugs while on stage but occasionally performed when hungover from the previous day. During the period he was using cocaine, he said that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> paranoid when performing on stage.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the earlier}} years, Mickey's design bore heavy {{resemblance}} to Oswald, {{save for the}} ears, nose, and tail. Ub Iwerks designed Mickey's body out of circles {{in order to make}} the character simple to animate. Disney employees John Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> more dynamic and appealing to audiences.|$|E
6000|$|Sammy had {{a sudden}} idea. <b>It</b> almost <b>made</b> <b>him</b> gasp. [...] "I tell you what, you work and I'll keep watch!" [...] he cried. [...] "You know my eyes are very sharp." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, easy," [...] {{said the}} tactful Mr. Mills. [...] "You can’t think what a {{difference}} <b>it’s</b> <b>made</b> to <b>him.</b> That’s why I came to see you—so you shouldn’t be startled." ...|$|R
25|$|Following {{his years}} with St. Anthony, he {{took part in}} the 2008 McDonald's All-American Boys Game with several other future stars, {{including}} Tyreke Evans, Kemba Walker, and Al-Farouq Aminu. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> only the sixth player from his high school to compete in the reputable game. At its conclusion, Rosario scored eighteen points and recorded five steals in 19 minutes on the court.|$|E
25|$|Nimoy was not {{the only}} person {{concerned}} with Spock's ears. NBC executives were worried that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> appear satanic, and were concerned that viewers would not wish to associate with an alien character. At the time, Roddenberry felt that the satanic issue might prove positive as he believed that female viewers would find a slightly dangerous and taboo character more attractive. This was supported by female visitors to the set who seemed to be immediately drawn to Nimoy.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{made his}} {{television}} debut with his talk show, Satyamev Jayate. The show dealt with social issues. It started airing on 6 May 2012. Aamir was paid Rs. 30million rupees per episode {{to host the}} Satyamev Jayate, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the highest paid host in Indian television industry as of June 2012. Aamir, speaking on a radio channel, said that in view of phenomenal public response, he may {{come up with a}} second season of the show. The show went live simultaneously on Star Plus, STAR World and national broadcaster Doordarshan on the 11am Sunday slot in eight languages, being the first to do so in India.|$|E
25|$|Because his {{business}} interests and his legislative duties were a considerable distance from Ranch Azalee, Montgomery drove {{tens of thousands}} of miles per year.

25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability to see both sides of a question and inability to make a decision and stick to <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E
25|$|He was {{appointed}} captain-secretary of Sussex in 1946. Although he relinquished the captaincy after one year, his wicket-keeping form earned him selection for the MCC {{tour of the}} West Indies in 1947–48. On his Test debut he {{was used as a}} makeshift opener as three senior batsmen were ill, and made 140 in six hours. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the only England player to make his maiden century on his Test debut. He toured South Africa (under F.G. Mann) in 1948–49 and played in the final two Tests, the only wicket-keeper to be preferred to Godfrey Evans between 1946 and 1959 when he was available to play. On his return, he retired to take up an appointment as the cricket correspondent of The Sunday Times. After two years in this role, he {{was appointed}} by the MCC in 1952 as one of two assistant secretaries to Ronnie Aird at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|Robert J. Maynard, Jr., {{a co-founder}} of the company, {{resigned}} in June 2007 amid questions about his past {{and the integrity of}} his story regarding his founding of LifeLock. Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.|$|E
