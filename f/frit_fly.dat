40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine an {{influence}} of the weather conditions on prey of <b>frit</b> <b>fly</b> and to evaluate differences between some types of sugar maize for damages made by this pest. The experiment was carried out on nine types of sugar maize, in the Experimental- -Didactic Unit in Swadzim, in years 2007 - 2009. The percentage of plants’ damages caused by <b>frit</b> <b>fly</b> was defined in the 6 - 9 leaves phase each year. Average monthly air temperatures, sums of monthly rainfalls and hydrothermal coefficient K by Selyaninov were used by evaluation. The results proved, that the weather conditions had a significant influence on prey of this pest and damages of sugar maize types were significantly different in the three-year period of the research...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{infection}} {{in relation to}} sowing time of winter rye (Secale cereale) was studied in southern Finland in order to compare overwintering capacity of modern rye varieties and to give recommendations for rye cultivation. This was done by using three sowing times and four rye varieties in field trials conducted at three locations in 1999 – 2001. The early sown rye (beginning of August) was severely affected by diseases caused by Puccinia recondita and Microdochium nivale, whereas postponing sowing for {{two weeks after the}} recommended sowing time resulted in considerably less infection. The infection levels of diseases differed among rye varieties. Finnish rye varieties Anna and Bor 7068 were more resistant to snow mould and more winter hardy than the Polish variety Amilo, or the German hybrid varieties Picasso and Esprit. However, Amilo was the most resistant to leaf rust. In the first year snow mould appeared to be the primary cause of winter damage, but in the second year the winter damage was positively correlated with leaf rust. No significant correlation between <b>frit</b> <b>fly</b> infestation and winter damage or disease incidence of snow mould or leaf rust was established. The late sowing of rye (in the beginning of September) is recommended in Finland, particularly with hybrid varieties, to minimize the need for chemical plant protection in autumn. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{agricultural}} ecosystems, pest insects, pathogens, {{and reduced}} soil fertility pose major challenges to crop productivity and {{are responsible for}} significant yield losses worldwide. Management of belowground pests and diseases remains particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the soil and the limited reach of conventional agrochemicals. Boosting the presence of beneficial rhizosphere organisms is a potentially sustainable alternative and may help to optimize crop health and productivity. Field application of single beneficial soil organisms has shown satisfactory results under optimal conditions. This might be further enhanced by combining multiple beneficial soil organisms, but this remains poorly investigated. Here, we inoculated wheat plots with combinations of three beneficial soil organisms that have different rhizosphere functions and studied their effects on crop performance. Plant beneficial Pseudomonas bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), were inoculated individually or in combinations at seeding, and their effects on plant performance were evaluated throughout the season. We used traditional and molecular identification tools to monitor their persistence over the cropping season in augmented and control treatments, and to estimate the possible displacement of native populations. In three separate trials, beneficial soil organisms were successfully introduced into the native populations and readily survived the field conditions. Various Pseudomonas, mycorrhiza, and nematode treatments improved plant health and productivity, while their combinations provided no significant additive or synergistic benefits compared to when applied alone. EPN application temporarily displaced some of the native EPN, but had no significant long-term effect on the associated food web. The strongest positive effect on wheat survival was observed for Pseudomonas and AMF during a season with heavy natural infestation by the <b>frit</b> <b>fly,</b> Oscinella frit, a major pest of cereals. Hence, beneficial impacts differed between the beneficial soil organisms and were most evident for plants under biotic stress. Overall, our findings indicate that in wheat production under the test conditions the three beneficial soil organisms can establish nicely and are compatible, but their combined application provides no additional benefits. Further studies are required, also in other cropping systems, to fine-tune the functional interactions among beneficial soil organisms, crops, and the environment...|$|E

Both urban lawns and semi-natural grasslands were sampled around Volkhov aluminum smelter and Syasskij pulp and paper mill. Fluorine- and sulphur-containirtg aerial emissions did not affect species richness, diversity, or composition of species assemblages of Chloropidae, whereas habitat deterioration during the course of urbanization caused changes in species composition and a decline in species richness and diversity of <b>frit</b> <b>flies...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Chloropidae are {{a family}} of flies {{commonly}} known as <b>frit</b> <b>flies</b> or grass flies. About 2000 described species are in over 160 genera distributed worldwide. These are usually very small flies, yellow or black and appearing shiny due to the virtual absence of any hairs. The majority of the larvae are phytophagous, mainly on grasses, and can be major pests of cereals. However, parasitic and predatory species are known. A few species are kleptoparasites. Some species in the genera Hippelates and Siphunculina (S. funicola being quite well known in Asia) are called eye gnats or eye flies for their habit of being attracted to eyes. They feed on lachrymal secretions and other body fluids of various animals, including humans and are of medical significance.|$|R

An inherent difficulty in using them methods is that slow heating rates mayresult in long treatment times and possible damage to fruit quality.

The basic heat transfer equation was developed under the following assumption; the fruit was in cylindrical shape, its thermal properties were constant, and the heat transfer occurred only in radial direction. The root mean square errors were 1. 65 oC at 13. 0 ± 0. 5 oC and 0. 88 oC at 48. 0 ± 0. 5 oC. Key word: thermal properties, modeling, mang...|$|R
