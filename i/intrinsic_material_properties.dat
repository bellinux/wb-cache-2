40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the eects of leptin receptor-deciency on the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> of vertebral mice bones, a total of twenty L 4 -vertebrae from the leptin receptor-decient (db/db) and wild-type (wt) mouse phenotype were tested, using the nanoindentation method. Each of the twenty samples was indented on cortical and trabecular bone regions, allowing for comparison between these two bone types. No signicant dierences were found in <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> of vertebrae between leptin receptor-decient and wild-type mouse phenotypes, within cortical and trabecular bone. The reduced elastic modulus of cortical bone {{was found to be}} 24 : 351 3 : 179 [GPa] versus 20 : 2382 : 364 [GPa] for trabecular bone. From this result, the former bone type is regarded to be stier than the latter. The hardness parameters were found to be: 1 : 055 0 : 135 [GPa] and 0 : 997 0 : 103 [GPa] for cortical and trabecular bone, respectively. From this result, the two bone types are not concluded to signicantly dier in hardness. Since the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> of hormonal controlled (db/db) and wild-type (control group) mouse phenotypes are found to be equal, it is concluded that the bonemineral density of both mouse species are equal as well, and therefore µCT-scan based bone-mineral density (BMD) measurements become a quantitative measure of density, rather than a qualitative measure of relative bone volume. ...|$|E

In clinical practice, bone substitute materials {{are being used}} for reconstructive purposes, bone stock augmentation, and bone repair. Over the last decade, the use of calcium phosphate (CaP) based bone substitute materials has increased exponentially. These bone substitute materials vary in composition, mechanical strength and biological mechanism of function, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. It is known that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> of CaP bone substitutes {{have a profound effect}} on their mechanical and biological behaviour and associated biodegradation. These material properties of bone substitutes, such as porosity, composition and geometry change the trade-off between mechanical and biological performance. The choice of the optimal bone substitutes is therefore not always an easy one, and largely depends on the clinical application and its associated biological and mechanical needs. Not all bone graft substitutes will perform the same way, and their performance in one clinical site may not necessarily predict their performance in another site. CaP bone substitutes unfortunately have yet to achieve optimal mechanical and biological performance and to date each material has its own trade-off between mechanical and biological performance.

40|$|The {{effects of}} bisphosphonate {{treatment}} schedule on fracture healing have not previously been tested. We evaluated {{the effect of}} ibandronate dosing interval duration on healing following surgical “fracture” (osteotomy) using a rat femoral fracture model. Six-week-old rats (n =  160) underwent osteotomy and were then allocated into vehicle control (CNT) or an ibandronate treatment group: 5  μg/kg daily (DAY, 5  days/week), 75  μg/kg once every 3  weeks (I- 3), 150  μg/kg once every 6  weeks (I- 6), resulting in the same total ibandronate dose over the study. Rats were killed after 6 or 18  weeks. At 18  weeks, all fracture lines had disappeared in the CNT and I- 6 groups; approximately 10 % of fracture lines remained in the DAY and I- 3 groups. Ibandronate-treated groups showed large callus areas around the fractures, which shrank between 6 and 18  weeks after surgery; the extent of shrinkage decreased with shorter dosing interval. In histomorphometry, callus remodeling was suppressed by ibandronate; this became more apparent at shorter dose intervals. The structural properties of osteotomized femora were increased in the DAY group compared with CNT, but <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> reduced inversely and became closer to those of CNT in response to increased dosing interval. Ibandronate induced formation of large calluses around osteotomies but delayed woven bone remodeling into lamellar bone and reduced <b>intrinsic</b> <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> in a rat fracture model.
