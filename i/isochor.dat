40|$|The {{theoretical}} perturbation {{equation of}} state developed by McQuarrie and Katz is considered. The equation is where n, m, and A are Lennard-Jones parameters; T* is the reduced temperature; n* is a reduced density; x is the reduced radial distance; and ghs(x, n*) is the hard sphere radial distribution function for a system of diameter equal to sigma. An improved equation developed by Carnahan and Starling {{is used for the}} hard sphere compressibility factor. Instead of using tables of the hard sphere radial distribution function to evaluate the integral, the quadrature of the integral's Laplace transform is used for which an analytic form exists. A computer program was written to evaluate the quadrature numerically. The effective hard sphere diameter, ca, was determined from experimental methane data at temperature T 0, which is the temperature for which (a 2 P/aT 2) mv is zero. From the {{equation of state}} it is possible to calculate an effective hard sphere diameter over a range of temperature. This effective hard sphere diameter was determined over the temperature range of 200 to 2000 °K. The hard sphere diameters which were calculated are compared with the effective hard sphere diameters predicted by Rowlinson and Barker and Henderson for the repulsive contribution of the intermolecular potential and with the experiment values. The deviation of the pressure of a linear van der Waals <b>isochor</b> from the actual experimental pressure was used to test the equation of state. It was found that the In T* term can not account for the deviation from a linear <b>isochor</b> observed experimentally. The diameter becomes negative for very large temperatures due to the in T* term, which originates from the Lennard-Jones potential. To predict the correct diameter and compressibility factor at very high temperatures a potential containing a hard core term is required...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{treats the}} topic of the {{characterization}} and optimization of CMOS compatible photo sensor elements (CPSE). To understand the functionality of a CPSE a pro founded basic knowledge is necessary in the fields of the ray-, wave and quantum optics. Therefore all in this context necessary and principal equations are presented {{at the beginning of this}} work. In addition belongs in particular the statistic investigation of the absorption and emission processes in the field of the quantum optics, since these processes are the basis to understand the elementary noise sources within a CPSE. After an introduction to the available technological realization each element of the equivalent circuit diagram is analyzed. The optical quantum efficiency is developed intended for arbitrary angles and optical multi-layer sequences. The internal quantum efficiency is determined with a new mathematical approach and offers thereby more possibilities of the interpretation of the results compared to the classical physical approach which usually proceed from approximation solutions. The physical operation limit of a sensor and thus its efficiency is specified by the power of the noise sources. In this work it is analytically proven that the statements of Einstein concerning the kTC noise of an individual RC combination also apply to coupled RC combinations. Thus a highly simplified viewpoint of the CPSE and the Switched Capacitor amplifier is possible. Several optimization strategies to improve the optical quantum efficiency, for example the oxide perforation, are introduced and realized. The electro optical parameters can be usually determined by the measurement of special test-structures. Furthermore in this work new test-structures are developed, manufactured and measured under the aspect of high insensitivity to measurement errors. These results lead to the development of an <b>Isochor</b> diagram which permits all important design parameters.

40|$|In {{the present}} article we carry out a {{molecular}} dynamics study of the core-softened system and show {{that the existence of}} the water-like anomalies in this system depends on the trajectory in P-ρ-T space along which the behavior of the system is studied. For example, diffusion and structural anomalies are visible along isotherms as a function of density, but disappears along the isochores and isobars as a function of temperature. On the other hand, the diffusion anomaly may be seen along adiabats as a function of temperature, density and pressure. It should be noted that it may be no signature of a particular anomaly along a particular trajectory, but the anomalous region for that particular anomaly can be defined when all possible trajectories in the same space are examined (for example, signature of diffusion anomaly is evident through the crossing of different isochors. However, there is no signature of diffusion anomaly along a particular <b>isochor).</b> We also analyze the applicability of the Rosenfeld entropy scaling relations to this system in the regions with the water-like anomalies.

Although the nematic phase is orientationally ordered but translationally disordered, a smectic phase {{is characterized by the}} appearance of a partial translational order in addition to a further increase in orientational order. In an attempt to understand the interplay between orientational and translational order in the mesophases that thermotropic liquid crystals typically exhibit upon cooling from the high-temperature isotropic phase, we investigate the potential energy landscapes of a family of model liquid crystalline systems. The configurations of the system corresponding to the local potential energy minima, known as the inherent structures, are determined from computer simulations across the mesophases. We find that the depth of the potential energy minima explored by the system along an <b>isochor</b> grows through the nematic phase as temperature drops in contrast to its insensitivity to temperature in the isotropic and smectic phases. The onset of the growth of the orientational order in the parent phase is found to induce a translational order, resulting in a smectic-like layer in the underlying inherent structures; the inherent structures, surprisingly, never seem to sustain orientational order alone if the parent nematic phase is sandwiched between the high-temperature isotropic phase and the low-temperature smectic phase. The Arrhenius temperature dependence of the orientational relaxation time breaks down near the isotropic-nematic transition. We find that this breakdown occurs at a temperature below which the system explores increasingly deeper potential energy minima...|$|E

General idea of heat engines cycles is the transfer of energy from the heater (both external and internal) to a working fluid, obtaining mechanical work from expanding of the working fluid, and returning the working fluid to the initial state by compression and excess heat discharge into a cooler.

40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of thermodynamic properties of petroleum reservoir fluids {{is of great}} interest to many applications, especially in petroleum engineering and chemical engineering. Molecular simulation has many appealing features, especially its requirement of fewer tuned parameters but yet better predicting capability; however {{it is well known that}} molecular simulation is very CPU expensive, as compared to equation of state approaches. We have recently introduced an efficient thermodynamically consistent technique to regenerate rapidly Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMCs) at different thermodynamic conditions from the existing data points that have been pre-computed with expensive classical simulation. This technique can speed up the simulation more than a million times, making the regenerated molecular simulation almost as fast as equation of state approaches. In this paper, this technique is first briefly reviewed and then numerically investigated in its capability of predicting ensemble averages of primary quantities at different neighboring thermodynamic conditions to the original simulated MCMCs. Moreover, this extrapolation technique is extended to predict second derivative properties (e. g. heat capacity and fluid compressibility). The method works by reweighting and reconstructing generated MCMCs in canonical ensemble for Lennard-Jones particles.

40|$|Abstract Background Seed {{plants are}} {{composed}} of angiosperms and gymnosperms, which diverged from each other around 300 million years ago. While much light has been shed on the mechanisms and rate of genome evolution in flowering plants, such knowledge remains conspicuously meagre for the gymnosperms. Conifers are key representatives of gymnosperms and {{the sheer size of}} their genomes represents a significant challenge for characterization, sequencing and assembling. Results To gain insight into the macro-organisation and long-term evolution of the conifer genome, we developed a genetic map involving 1, 801 spruce genes. We designed a statistical approach based on kernel density estimation to analyse gene density and identified seven gene-rich <b>isochors.</b> Groups of co-localizing genes were also found that were transcriptionally co-regulated, indicative of functional clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of 157 gene families for which at least two duplicates were mapped on the spruce genome indicated that ancient gene duplicates shared by angiosperms and gymnosperms outnumbered conifer-specific duplicates by a ratio of eight to one. Ancient duplicates were much more translocated within and among spruce chromosomes than conifer-specific duplicates, which were mostly organised in tandem arrays. Both high synteny and collinearity were also observed between the genomes of spruce and pine, two conifers that diverged more than 100 million years ago. Conclusions Taken together, these results indicate that much genomic evolution has occurred in the seed plant lineage before the split between gymnosperms and angiosperms, and that the pace of evolution of the genome macro-structure has been much slower in the gymnosperm lineage leading to extent conifers than that seen for the same period of time in flowering plants. This trend is largely congruent with the contrasted rates of diversification and morphological evolution observed between these two groups of seed plants. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} {{surface of}} the eye is covered by a thin tear film, which lubricates and protects the ocular surface as well as provides a smooth optical interface for light to enter the eye. The outermost layer of the tear film is a lipid layer produced mainly by the Meibomian glands. Tear film lipid layer (TFLL) is thought to stabilize the tear film and prevent the ocular surface from drying by retarding evaporation of the aqueous tear fluid. A deficient TFLL leads to increased evaporation and is a common cause of dry eye syndrome. Dry eye syndrome is a disease of the ocular surface that causes discomfort, disturbance of vision and possible damage to the ocular surface. It {{is one of the}} most common diagnoses among ophthalmologic patients, with tens of millions of people suffering from moderate-to-severe symptoms worldwide and many more from milder or more periodic symptoms. The molecular organization responsible for the evaporation retarding properties of TFLL is not well understood. Some lipids, like saturated fatty acids and fatty alcohols are known to be efficient evaporation retarding lipids. However, TFLL consists mostly of wax esters, cholesteryl esters and unsaturated polar lipids, which have not been typically considered to be effective in retarding evaporation. According to recent studies, pure wax ester films do retard evaporation, but only close to their bulk melting temperature. In this Master's thesis, the properties of behenyl palmitoleate (BP), a wax ester closely resembling the most abundant wax esters found in tear fluid, were studied at the air-water interface. The aims of the study were to characterize the phase behaviour of BP at the air-water interface and determine the molecular basis of its evaporation retarding properties. Isotherms and <b>isochors</b> were measured, coupled with imaging by Brewster angle microscopy. In addition, the evaporation resistance of BP films were measured. BP was found to exist in a fluid state that spreads efficiently but does not retard evaporation and a solid state that does not spread but efficiently retards evaporation. Approximately 3 °C below bulk melting temperature, solid and fluid monolayer phases coexist, allowing a solid monolayer to cover the water surface. Furthermore, BP was found to assume an extended conformation in the solid phase, which allows tight packing of the molecules and prevents the permeation of water. Taken together, these results provide a molecular level explanation for the evaporation retarding properties of wax esters several degrees below their bulk melting temperature...|$|R

It has been used with two wires, of diameters (0. 05 and 0. 150) mm, to measure the viscosity of methylbenzene and two reference fluids with viscosities of (10 and 100) mPa·s at T = 298 K and p = 0. 1 MPa, at temperatures in the range (298 to 373) K and pressures up to 40 MPa, where the viscosity covers the range (0. 3 to 100) mPa·s, with a standard uncertainty < 0. 6 %. The results differ from literature values by < ± 1 %. The results demonstrate that increasing the wire diameter increases the upper operating viscosity range of the vibrating wire viscometer, a result anticipated from the working equations. For the microwave cavity resonator, the method is based on the measurements of the resonance frequency of the lowest order inductive-capacitance mode. The apparatus is capable of operating at temperatures up to 473 K and pressures below 20 MPa. This instrument has been used to measure the dew pressures of { 0. 4026 CH 4 + 0. 5974 C 3 H 8 } at a temperature range from 315 K up to the cricondentherm ˜ 340 K. The measured dew pressures differ by less than 0. 5 % from values obtained by interpolation of those reported in the literature, which were determined from measurements with experimental techniques that have quite different potential sources of systematic error than the radio-frequency resonator used here. Dew pressures estimated from both NIST 14 and the Peng-Robinson equation of state lie within < ± 1 % of the present results at temperature between (315 and 337) K while predictions obtained from the Soave-Redlich-Kwong cubic equation of state deviate from our results by 0. 4 % at T = 315 K and these differences increase smoothly with increasing temperature to be - 2. 4 % at T = 337 K. Densities derived from dielectric permittivity measurements in the gas phase lie within < 0. 6 % of the values calculated from the Soave-Redlich-Kwong cubic equation of state and about 1 % from values obtained with the Harvey and Prausnitz correlation based on a mixture reduced density. The calculations with Kiselev and Ely parametric crossover equation of state (based on Patel-Teja EOS) gave deviations < 0. 7 %. Liquid volume fractions, in the 2 -phase region, were measured from (0. 5 to 7) cm 3 in a total volume of about 50 cm 3 at different <b>isochors.</b> The measured liquid volume fractions differ from values obtained with the Soave-Redlich-Kwong cubic equation of state by between 0 and 3 % at T < 326 K and about 8 % on approach to the critical region. The large deviations observed in the critical region were anticipated because of the known poor performance of the cubic equations of state with regard to the calculation of the liquid density {{in the vicinity of the}} critical temperature...|$|R
40|$|The Lamego orogenic {{gold deposit}} (440, 742 oz gold {{measured}} reserves and 2. 4 million t measured resources, {{with an average}} grade of 5. 71 g/t Au and a cut-off grade of 2. 15 g/t Au; AngloGold Ashanti Córrego do Sítio Mineração S/A (AGA) personal communication, 2014) {{is located in the}} 5 km-long trend that includes the world-class Cuiabá deposit. It is hosted in the Neoarchean metavolcano–sedimentary rocks of the Rio das Velhas greenstone belt, Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil. Mineralization is associated mainly with metachert–banded iron formation (BIF) and carbonaceous phyllites in the reclined Lamego fold, in which the Cabeça de Pedra orebody represents the hinge zone. Mineralization is concentrated in silicification zones and their quartz veins, as well as in sulfide minerals, product of BIF sulfidation. Hydrothermal alteration varies according to host rock, with abundant sulfide–carbonate in BIF, and sericite–chlorite in carbonaceous phyllite. Quartz vein classification according to structural relationships and host rocks identified three vein systems. The V 1 system, mainly composed of smoky quartz (Qtz I) and pyrite, is extensional, crosscuts the bedding plane S 0 of BIF, and is parallel to the fold axis. The V 2 system, of the same composition, is represented by veins that are parallel to the S 1 – 2 foliation and S 0. This system is also characterized by silicification zones in the BIF–carbonaceous phyllite contact that has its maximum expression in the hinge zone of folds. The V 3 system has milky quartz (Qtz II) veins, which result from the recrystallization of smoky quartz, located mainly in shear zones and faults; these veins form structures en echelon and vein arrays. The most common ore minerals are pyrite, As-pyrite and arsenopyrite. Fluid inclusion-FI trapped in all quartz veins present composition in the H 2 O–CO 2 ± CH 4 –NaCl system. Fluid evolution can be interpreted in two stages: i) aqueous–carbonic fluid trapped in Qtz I, of low salinity (~ 2 % equiv. wt. % NaCl), and ii) carbonic–aqueous fluid, of moderate salinity (average 9 eq. wt. % NaCl) hosted in Qtz II. Both stages are characterized by decrepitation temperatures in the range of 200 to > 300 °C, and suggest a fluid of metamorphic origin. Applying an arsenopyrite geothermometer, the calculated formation temperature for the Cabeça de Pedra orebody is 300 to 375 °C. The vertical intersection of the <b>isochors</b> allows a minimum pressure calculation of 2. 6 kbar. The composition of individual FIs of this orebody, obtained by LA-ICP-MS analyses, compared with results of FIs for the Carvoaria Velha deposit, Córrego do Sítio lineament, highlights a standard composition typical of metamorphic fluids with Na > K > Ca > Mg, which increase or decrease in concentration as a function of salinity in both deposits. Trace elements vary according to fluid–rock reactions, and are directly related to the host rock composition. The comparison of data sets of the two deposits shows that the Cabeça de Pedra FIs have a higher enrichment in Zn, while Cu, As and Sb are richer in Carvoaria Velha, suggesting influence of the host rock geochemistry. The suggested mechanisms for gold precipitation at the Cabeça de Pedra orebody, Lamego gold deposit are: i) hydrolysis of the carbonaceous matter of phyllite and BIF, affecting fO 2, destabilizing sulfur complexes and enhancing gold precipitation; ii) replacement of BIF iron carbonates by sulfides; and iii) continuous pressure changes that lead to silica precipitation and free gold. Other than playing the long-recognized role of the carbonaceous phyllites as a fluid barrier, the data highlight their importance as a source of metals...|$|R
