50|$|A glidant is a {{substance}} that is added to a powder to improve its <b>flowability.</b> A glidant will only work at a certain range of concentrations. Above a certain concentration, the glidant will in fact function to inhibit <b>flowability.</b>|$|E
50|$|A glidant's {{effect is}} due to the {{counter-action}} of factors that cause poor <b>flowability</b> of powders. For instance, correcting surface irregularity, reducing interparticular friction and decreasing surface charge. The result is a decrease in the angle of repose which is an indication of an enhanced powder's <b>flowability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Carr {{index is}} {{frequently}} used in pharmaceutics {{as an indication}} of the <b>flowability</b> of a powder. In a free-flowing powder, the bulk density and tapped density would be close in value, therefore, the Carr index would be small. On the other hand, in a poor-flowing powder where there are greater interparticle interactions, the difference between the bulk and tapped density observed would be greater, therefore, the Carr index would be larger. A Carr index greater than 25 is considered to be an indication of poor <b>flowability,</b> and below 15, of good <b>flowability.</b>|$|E

The first generation of SCC used in North America was characterized by the use of relatively high content of binder as well as high dosages of chemicals admixtures, usually superplasticizer to enhance <b>flowability</b> and stability. Such high-performance concrete had been used mostly in repair applications and for casting concrete in restricted areas.

50|$|Foods are dried {{to inhibit}} {{microbial}} development and quality decay. However, {{the extent of}} drying depends on product end-use. Cereals and oilseeds are dried after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during storage. Vegetables are blanched before drying to avoid rapid darkening, and drying is not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must be dried to very low moisture contents {{in order to ensure}} <b>flowability</b> and avoid caking. This moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial development. Other products as crackers are dried beyond the microbial growth threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.|$|E
5000|$|An {{excipient}} is {{a substance}} formulated alongside {{the active ingredient}} of a medication, included {{for the purpose of}} long-term stabilization, bulking up solid formulations that contain potent active ingredients in small amounts (thus often referred to as [...] "bulking agents", [...] "fillers", or [...] "diluents"), or to confer a therapeutic enhancement on the active ingredient in the final dosage form, such as facilitating drug absorption, reducing viscosity, or enhancing solubility. Excipients can also be useful in the manufacturing process, to aid in the handling of the active substance concerned such as by facilitating powder <b>flowability</b> or non-stick properties, in addition to aiding in vitro stability such as prevention of denaturation or aggregation over the expected shelf life. The selection of appropriate excipients also depends upon the route of administration and the dosage form, as well as the active ingredient and other factors.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most states}} have {{somewhat}} limited experience to date with flowable fill, nearly all {{states that have}} used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance {{with little or no}} problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance {{to the use of the}} material by contractors or engineers. Since flowable fill is normally a comparatively low-strength material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in flowable fill or controlled low strength material mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in flowable fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix <b>flowability.</b> Its relatively low dry unit weight (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they are}} even more basic, the alkali-loaded polymorphs are {{correspondingly}} more reactive. Appreciable amounts (>1%) in cement make set control difficult, and the cement becomes excessively hygroscopic. The cement powder <b>flowability</b> is reduced, and air-set lumps tend to form. They withdraw water from gypsum on storage of the cement, leading to false set. For this reason, their formation is avoided wherever possible. It is more energetically favorable for sodium and potassium to form sulfates and chlorides in the kiln, but if insufficient sulfate ion is present, any surplus alkalis congregate in the aluminate phase. The feed and fuel in the kiln system are preferably controlled chemically to keep the sulfate and alkalis in balance. However, this stoichiometry is only maintained if there is substantial surplus oxygen in the kiln atmosphere: if [...] "reducing conditions" [...] set in, then sulfur is lost as SO2, and reactive aluminates start to form. This is readily monitored by tracking the clinker sulfate level on an hour-to-hour basis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This work {{reports on}} the <b>flowability</b> of novel milk powders that have {{potential}} for appli-cation {{in the manufacture of}} chocolate. Many milk powders are cohesive which can give rise to powder flow problems. Shear cell techniques were used to measure the following powder flow pro-perties: powder flowfunction, effective angle of internal friction and angle of wall friction. These measurements were used in assessing cohesion developed within the powders under compaction and adhesion to a stainless steel surface. The work investigated how fat content, free-fat content, particle size, moisture content, lactose content, amorphous lactose content and storage conditions influenced the <b>flowability</b> of the milk powders. Increased fat content reduced powder <b>flowability</b> especially when comparing 1 % and 26 % fat powders. Varying free-fat content showed no effect on <b>flowability.</b> Particle size had a major influence on <b>flowability,</b> as increasing the particle size signi-ficantly improved the <b>flowability</b> of powders with 1 % and 26 % fat content. The concentration of amorphous lactose present increased the susceptibility of powders for sorbing moisture, resulting in reduced <b>flowability</b> and caking. Finally, powder flow property measurements can be applied in the design of hoppers and silos that give consistent reliable flow, which is essential in powder handling and processing operations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>flowability</b> of bulk solids can {{be treated}} {{as one of the}} {{fundamental}} properties that determine their behaviour through industrial processes. Developing a standard meaningful test for measuring <b>flowability</b> has always been a challenge and numerous methods exist, based on the correlation of a number of physical properties such as gravity flowrate, internal strength, bulk density change, etc., which are thought to represent the ability of a powder to flow in some sort of a conceptual situation. Different industries have employed and standardized different techniques for <b>flowability</b> measurement, and the results these obtain may not correlate. The article details an investigation into the ability of various <b>flowability</b> measuring methods to detect small changes in the powder flow properties. Four <b>flowability</b> measuring methods, Hall flow, Hausner ratio, compressibility, and shear cell (manual and automated), were used to measure the <b>flowability</b> of four physically and chemically similar iron blends.

40|$|The {{demanding}} {{performance criteria}} of high-performance concrete (HPC) {{such as high}} <b>flowability</b> and low segregation make superplasticiser (SP) indispensable in concrete production. SP is commonly added to concrete to increase <b>flowability</b> without undermining its strength. However, over-dosage of SP will cause segregation. This not only decreases the strength but also implies {{that there is a}} maximum limit of <b>flowability</b> that can be reached before segregation occurs. Increasing this maximum limit, or in general the overall flowability-segregation performance, is essential for HPC. In this study, limestone (LS) and silica fume (SF) were used as partial replacements of cement and the overall flowability-segregation performance of concrete was studied. The results showed that, with the addition of LS or SF, more SP was needed to achieve similar <b>flowability</b> but the maximum limit of <b>flowability</b> before reaching unacceptable segregation (> 20 % sieve segregation ratio) was improved, implying that replacement of cement by LS or SF with additional SP actually enhances the overall flowability-segregation performance of concrete. Accordingly, the design limits of <b>flowability</b> and segregation can be improved when LS or SF is added to the concrete, which is a very useful result for the design of selfcompacting concrete...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a {{characterization of the}} following dry granular materials: soya, colza and rye seeds. The physical properties of the grains and the materials are useful for characterizing the materials' behaviour during flow, while the external conditions (consolidation) determine storage and handling conditions. The physical properties of the grains (specific densities) and of the materials as a whole (compacity or porosity, and critical angles) were measured. The flow functions were determined by modified shear box testing. Then the internal friction angles and the <b>flowability</b> index for each granular material were obtained. Indeed, the behaviour of a flowing granular material results from these two groups of factors and {{is characterized by the}} <b>flowability,</b> which is the ratio of highest consolidation stress and unconfined yield strength.

40|$|Powder <b>flowability</b> {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} in {{the pharmaceutical}} tabletting process. The <b>flowability</b> is affected by both the particles 2 ̆ 7 properties and the tabletting equipment characteristics. Although it is generally accepted that powder <b>flowability</b> increases with an increase in particle size, quantitative studies and comprehensive theoretical insights into the particle property effects are still lacking. In this paper, ibuprofen, a non-steroidal drug widely used as an anti-inflammatory analgesic was chosen as a model material to assess the effect of particle properties on its <b>flowability.</b> Ibuprofen typically has a needle shaped morphology. The <b>flowability</b> of ibuprofen size fractions was studied in detail using two flow measurement methods. The separated fractions were also compared to magnesium stearate lubricated ibuprofen and its size fractions. The experimental results showed that powder <b>flowability</b> is significantly affected by both the particle size and size distribution. The finest size fraction that is separated from the bulk ibuprofen powder flows better than the bulk powder. For powders with narrow size distributions, the <b>flowability</b> increases significantly with the increase in particle size. In addition, admixing magnesium stearate to ibuprofen not only increases the flow function of the powder, but also reduces the internal friction angle. A theoretical analysis based on the limiting tensile strength of the powder bed was carried out and the flow conditions for particles of different size and shape were developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

Although cohesiveness of a bolus is an essential parameter in swallowing, a robust technique for objective measurement of cohesiveness of particulated semi- or soft-solids is still lacking. In our approach the ring shear tester is used to measure the cohesiveness and <b>flowability</b> of a model particulated food system based on fresh green pea powders and pastes with controlled moisture content. The focus is on how the cohesiveness and <b>flowability</b> of dry pea particles change as they absorb moisture, swell and soften, while continuously agglomerating until a paste like bolus is achieved. Differently hydrated pea powders start to granulate with increasing moisture content resulting in decreasing <b>flowability</b> and increasing cohesiveness until a critical moisture content of approximately 73 wt% is reached. Above the critical moisture content, cohesiveness starts to decrease and <b>flowability</b> increases, i. e. indicating the transition into the rheological domain of concentrated suspension flow.

40|$|The {{iron content}} of the ore used is crucial for the {{productivity}} and coke consumption rate in blast furnace pig iron production. Therefore, most iron ore deposits are processed in beneficiation plants to increase the iron content and remove impurities. In several comminution stages, the particle size of the ore is reduced {{to ensure that the}} iron oxides are physically liberated from the gangue. Subsequently, physical separation processes are applied to concentrate the iron ore. The fine-grained ore concentrates produced need to be transported, stored, and processed.

The <b>flowability</b> of powders depends on several properties of the material: grain size, grain size distribution, grain shape, and moisture {{content of the}} material.

In this study, the influence of the moisture content on the <b>flowability</b> for the Krivoy Rog magnetite iron ore concentrate was investigated. Dry iron ore concentrate was mixed with varying amounts of water to produce samples with a moisture content in the range of 0. 2 to 12. 2 %.
