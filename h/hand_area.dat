50|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances, the genetically determined circuitry in {{the brain}} remains largely stable throughout life. It was thought, until about 30 years ago, that no new neural circuits could be formed in the adult mammalian brain. Recently, functional MRI studies in amputees have shown that almost all patients have experienced motor cortical remapping. The majority of motor reorganization has occurred as a downward shift of the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> of the cortex onto the area of face representation, especially the lips. Sometimes there is a side shift of the hand motor cortex to the ipsilateral cortex. In patients with phantom limb pain, the reorganization was great enough to cause a change in cortical lip representation into the hand areas only during lip movements. It has also been found {{that there is a}} high correlation between the magnitude of phantom limb pain {{and the extent to which}} the shift of the cortical representation of the mouth into the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> in motor and somatosensory cortical reorganization has occurred. Additionally, as phantom pains in upper extremity amputees increased, there was a higher degree of medial shift of the facial motor representation. There are multiple theories that try to explain how cortical remapping occurs in amputees, but none have been supported to a great extent.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} BP has two {{component}}s, the early one (BP1) lasting from about −1.2 to −0.5; the late component (BP2) from −0.5 to shortly before 0 sec. The pre-motion positivity is even smaller, and the motor-potential which starts about fifty to sixty milliseconds before {{the onset of}} movement and has its maximum over the contralateral precentral <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> is still smaller. Thus, it takes great care to see these potentials: exact triggering by the real onset of movement is important, which is especially difficult preceding speech movements. Furthermore, artifacts due to head-, eye-, lid-, mouth-movements and respiration have to be eliminated before averaging because such artifacts may be of a magnitude which makes it difficult to render them negligible even after hundreds of sweeps. In the case of eye movements eye muscle potentials have to be distinguished from cerebral potentials. In some cases animal experiments were necessary to clarify the origin of potentials such as the R-wave. Therefore, it took many years until some of the other laboratories were able to confirm the details of Kornhuber & Deecke's results. In addition to the finger or eye movements as mentioned above, the BP has been recorded accompanying willful movements of the wrist, arm, shoulder, hip, knee, foot and toes. It was also recorded prior to speaking, writing and also swallowing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor pre-surgical {{planning}} {{we present}} quantitative {{comparison of the}} location of the <b>hand</b> motor functional <b>area</b> determined by right hand finger tapping BOLD fMRI, resting state BOLD fMRI, and anatomically using high resolution T 1 weighted images. Data were obtained on 10 healthy subjects and 25 patients with left sided brain tumors. Our results show that there are important differences in the locations (i. e., > 20 mm) of the determined hand motor voxels by these three MR imaging methods. This can have significant effect on the pre-surgical planning of these patients depending on the modality used. In 13 of the 25 cases (i. e., 52 %) the distances between the task-determined and the rs-fMRI determined <b>hand</b> <b>areas</b> were more than 20 mm; in 13 of 25 cases (i. e., 52 %) the distances between the task-determined and anatomically determined <b>hand</b> <b>areas</b> were > 20 mm; and in 16 of 25 cases (i. e., 64 %) the distances between the rs-fMRI determined and anatomically determined <b>hand</b> <b>areas</b> were more than 20 mm. In just three cases, the distances determined by all three modalities were within 20 mm of each other. The differences in the location or fingerprint of the <b>hand</b> motor <b>areas,</b> as determined by these three MR methods result from the different underlying mechanisms of these three modalities and possibly the effects of tumors on these modalities...|$|R

Hunter-Reay stopped for fuel and tires on lap 113. This left all of the top six runners being Honda powered, in contrast to pre-race predictions on relative engine performance and economy.On lap 115 Hildebrand pitted from sixteenth. Rahal pitted afterwards. On lap 119 Franchitti pit stopped from second place with no adjustments made {{to the car and}} the following lap Dixon pitted from the lead having led for a total of 37 laps by that stage. This left Sato leading, the eighteenth leader of the day. Andretti ran second. Sato pitted from the lead on lap 124. On lap 125 Hinchcliffe pitted and Barrichello who had led for one lap pitted. On lap 126 Sato lead, with Franchitti behind. On lap 128 Ryan Hunter-Reay retired with a failure of an upright on the car's suspension.On lap 134 the leaderboard stood as Sato, Franchitti, Andretti, Dixon, Rahal.On lap 145 Andretti pitted having complained about a vibration on the car and replaced the tires. Rahal also pitted just before. The caution was issued on lap 146 when Saavedra stopped on the exit of the pitlane. Starting lap 147 under caution the majority of the lead drivers stopped including Sato, Franchitti, Dixon, Rahal, Hinchcliffe and more.Following such pitstops, by lap 150 Sato led followed by Franchitti, Dixon, Hinchcliffe, Wilson, Kimball, Briscoe, Kanaan and Castroneves.On lap 153 the restart occurred and Franchiti passed Sato on the backstraight of the circuit and at the start of lap 154 Dixon passed Sato for second into turn one. On lap 160 Dixon started to pressure Franchitti and had come under pressure from Sato behind. Dixon passed for the lead but starting lap 161 Dario Franchitti retook the lead at turn one.On lap 163 Josef Newgarden stopped due to engine problems, pulling over to the left <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> of grass {{on the inside of the}} track on the backstraight between turns two and three, bringing out the safety car and another full course caution. Sato, Franchitti and Dixon pitted under caution, along with Hinchcliffe and others. Hinchcliffe stopped for a longer period than the others and appeared to run over some pit equipment upon exiting.Prior to the restart Dixon led from Franchiti and Sato.On lap 171 the race restarted. Wilson passed Sato upon the restart. Franchitti repassed Dixon. Starting lap 173 Wilson was repassed by Sato and soon was passed by Carpenter, Kanaan and Kimball having run high on the exit of the turn when passed by Sato and lost speed.By lap 176, 28 lead changes had taken place, one fewer than the 1960 record of 29 changes in one Indianapolis 500 race. Starting lap 178 when Franchitti overtook Dixon this broke the record. The leading Ganassi pair of Franchitti and Dixon appeared to express concern over fuel consumption and speed.On lap 180 Carpenter spun but did not hit the wall, spinning across the track and coming to a halt, then gesticulating at marshals to help turn the car around. This caused a full course caution and seemingly eliminated the need for the leaders to need to refuel. Carpenter then continued. On lap 187 Andretti overcalculated and drove into the wall, sliding across the track and coming to a halt.|$|E

An adult macaque monkey performed two manual dexterity tasks: (i) “modified Brinkman board” task, assessed simple precision grip versus complex precision grip, the latter involved a hand postural adjustment; (ii) “modified Klüver board” task, assessed movements ranging from power grip to precision grip, pre-shaping and grasping. Two consecutive unilateral M 1 lesions targeted the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> of each hemisphere, the second lesion was performed after stable, though incomplete, functional recovery from the primary lesion. Following each lesion, the manual dexterity of the contralesional hand was affected in a comparable manner, effects being progressively more deleterious from power grip to simple and then complex precision grips. Both tasks yielded consistent data, namely that the secondary M 1 lesion did not have a significant impact on the recovered performance from the primary M 1 lesion, which took place 5 months earlier. In conclusion, the intact contralesional M 1 did not play a major role in the long-term functional recovery from a primary M 1 lesion targeted to the <b>hand</b> <b>area...</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{intensive}} training and expertise are associated with functional and structural neuroadaptations. Most studies, however, compared experts with nonexperts; hence it is, specifically for sports, unclear whether the neuroplastic adaptations reported are sport-specific or sport-general. Here we aimed at investigating sport-specific adaptations in professional handball players and ballet dancers {{by focusing on the}} primary motor and somatosensory grey matter (GM) representation of hands and feet using voxel-based morphometry as well as on fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corticospinal tract by means of diffusion tensor imaging-based fibre tractography. As predicted, GM volume was increased in <b>hand</b> <b>areas</b> of handball players, whereas ballet dancers showed increased GM volume in foot areas.

40|$|The current {{method of}} localizing {{somatosensory}} and motor cortex during neurosurgical removal of abnormal tissue is Penfield's method of cortical stimulation. While useful, this method has drawbacks, {{in particular the}} need to operate under local anesthesia. Another method of localization, described here, involves intra-operative recording of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials to stimulation of the contralateral median nerve, from electrodes placed directly on central cortex. Proper localization involves identification of potentials which invert in polarity across the central sulcus, identification of other potentials which are largest in the medial portion of the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> of somatosensory cortex and do not polarity invert, and determination of the region of maximal potential amplitude.

40|$|Does {{language}} comprehension depend, in part, on neural {{systems for}} action? In previous studies, motor {{areas of the}} brain were activated when people read or listened to action verbs, but it remains unclear whether such activation is functionally relevant for comprehension. In the experiments reported here, we used off-line theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate whether a causal relationship exists between activity in premotor cortex and action-language understanding. Right-handed participants completed a lexical decision task, in which they read verbs describing manual actions typically performed with the dominant hand (e. g., “to throw,” “to write”) and verbs describing nonmanual actions (e. g., “to earn,” “to wander”). Responses to manual-action verbs (but not to nonmanual-action verbs) were faster after stimulation of the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> in left premotor cortex than after stimulation of the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> in right premotor cortex.

40|$|Although {{it is well}} {{established}} that regions of premotor cortex (PMC) are active during action observation, it remains controversial whether they play a causal role in action understanding.

Participants received cTBS over the hand and lip areas of left PMC, in separate sessions, before completing a pantomime-recognition task in which half of the trials contained pantomimed hand actions, and half contained pantomimed mouth actions.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to clarify the effects of foot muscle {{relaxation}} on activity in the primary motor cortex of the <b>hand</b> <b>area.</b> Subjects were asked to volitionally relax the right foot from sustained contraction of either the dorsiflexor (tibialis anterior; TA relaxation) or plantarflexor (soleus; SOL relaxation) in response to an auditory stimulus. Single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the <b>hand</b> <b>area</b> of the left primary motor cortex at different time intervals before and after the onset of TA or SOL relaxation. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and flexor carpi radialis (FCR).

Furthermore, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) of ECR evaluated with paired-pulse TMS temporarily increased after TA relaxation onset. Our findings indicate that muscle relaxation of the dorsiflexor reduced corticospinal excitability of the ipsilateral hand muscles.

Frontal CNV habituated in the sustained, but not the delayed response task, suggested that frontal negative variations in the former case signify an orienting response to novelty or uncertainty. The absence of habituation in the delay condition was interpreted in terms of the motor inhibitory function of frontal association cortex. Performance feedback appeared to enhance CNV indirectly by increasing the motivation of subjects.

Just how rTMS may have persistent effects on cortical function remains unclear. We hypothesised that it may act by modulating cortico-cortical and interhemispheric connectivity. To this end we assessed cortico-cortical and interhemispheric coherence before and after low frequency, subthreshold rTMS of the left motor cortex. METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects received one train (1 Hz, 90 % of active motor threshold, 1500 stimuli) of rTMS to the left motor <b>hand</b> <b>area.</b> Spectral power and coherence estimates were calculated between different electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at rest and while muscles of the distal upper limb were tonically contracted.
