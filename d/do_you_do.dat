He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

500|$|The alto aria, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, {{what is a}} human being), is {{accompanied}} by a solo oboe d'amore that [...] "expresses wonder about the nature of man" [...] and God's interest in him. The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> all this for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E

While Searls' Jaws 2 novelization {{was based on an}} earlier draft of that film and was {{significantly}} different from the finished film, his Jaws: The Revenge novelization sticks fairly close to the final film, although it does contain some extra subplots. The novel contains a subplot in which Hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money. The only reference to this in the film is when Michael Brody asks [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> when you’re not flying people?" [...] to which Hoagie replies, [...] "I deliver laundry." [...] In Searls' novel, the character of Jake is ultimately killed by the shark; Jake was originally supposed to die in the film, but the script was changed to allow him to survive.|$|E

500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> when you know something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping".

Before the show, Madonna {{expressed concern about the}} physical and time constraints of the event. [...] "I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to take it down. So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out."

500|$|On 26 November 1962, the Beatles {{recorded}} {{their second}} single, [...] "Please Please Me". At {{the start of}} the recording session, George Martin attempted to persuade them to record a different song instead ("How <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> It", subsequently a hit for Gerry & The Pacemakers). Martin liked the song and felt the Beatles could have a big hit with it. The Beatles, however, did not like it and, furthermore, they wanted to record their own compositions. They became uncooperative, as they had done at an earlier session when Martin had tried to use the song, so Martin finally abandoned the idea and [...] "Please Please Me" [...] was recorded instead. The single, released in the UK in January 1963, reached No. 2 on the UK chart of Record Retailer, now considered the most authoritative of the era, and No. 1 on both the NME and Melody Maker charts. Three months after recording [...] "Please Please Me", the Beatles would record their first album, also titled Please Please Me, which was released in the UK in March 1963.|$|E
500|$|After the plotlines were developed, major {{deviations}} sometimes {{occurred in}} the writing process. Like in {{the final version of}} the script, twins with mind-control abilities were the focus of Edlund's original pitch for the episode [...] "Simon Said". However, the more powerful twin—kept secluded due to deformities—forced his brother to perceive himself as retarded. At the end of the episode, his brother ate him in retaliation. The story was eventually changed, and instead focused on questions such as [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with power?". Kripke felt that this fit greatly with the series' storyline, because Sam was uncomfortable with his developing abilities; the writers wanted to explore one of the psychic children who took his ability as a gift. [...] "Folsom Prison Blues" [...] stemmed from Kripke's desire to feature prison ghosts, and the initial plot had FBI Agent Henriksen finally capturing the brothers and sending them to prison. However, this caused a major complication: the writers would have to devise a way for Sam and Dean to escape in the end. Writer John Shiban suggested that the brothers be arrested on purpose in order to work a job, with the prison's head guard being revealed as a family friend.|$|E
