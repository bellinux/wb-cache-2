25|$|Several {{strategies}} {{exist for}} constructing homochiral MOFs. Crystallization of homochiral MOFs via self-resolution from achiral linker ligands {{is one of}} the way to accomplish such a goal. However, the resulting bulk samples contain both <b>enantiomorphs</b> and are racemic. Aoyama and coworkers successfully obtained homochiral MOFs in the bulk from achiral ligands by carefully controlling nucleation in the crystal growth process. Zheng and coworkers reported the synthesis of homochiral MOFs from achiral ligands by chemically manipulating the statistical fluctuation of the formation of enantiomeric pairs of crystals. Growing MOF crystals under chiral influences is another approach to obtain homochiral MOFs using achiral linker ligands. Rosseinsky and coworkers have introduced a chiral coligand to direct the formation of homochiral MOFs by controlling the handedness of the helices during the crystal growth. Morris and coworkers utilized ionic liquid with chiral cations as reaction media for synthesizing MOFs, and obtained homochiral MOFs. The most straightforward and rational strategy for synthesizing homochiral MOFs is, however, to use the readily available chiral linker ligands for their construction.|$|E

50|$|Any crystal {{which has}} a mirror plane {{as one of its}} {{symmetry}} elements has the property that its mirror image (with any plane as the mirror plane) can always be superimposed on the original crystal by translation or rotation or both. If there are no mirror planes as symmetry elements then the mirror image of a crystal cannot be brought into superposition with the original crystal by rotation or translation. This is enantiomorphism, and the mirror images are said to be <b>enantiomorphs</b> of each other. The possibility of enantiomorphic crystals is determined by the crystal symmetry, i.e., by the point group of the crystal species. There are 32 possible point groups, and 22 of these are capable of forming <b>enantiomorphs.</b> The <b>enantiomorphs</b> are designated right or left handed, according to whether they rotate the plane of polarised light to the right or to the left.
