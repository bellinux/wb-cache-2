5|$|As a {{young man}} he married Rampanambonitany. Oral history {{provides}} two conflicting accounts of their marriage. According to one version, the couple had no children of their own, leading the king to adopt the eight daughters and five sons of his sister Rangorinimerina. In another version, {{at least some of}} the five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana. The names of only three of his eight <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> preserved in the oral histories: Randriamizaza, Rahisatra and Rahira.|$|E

5|$|Njörðr is {{referenced}} in stanza 22 of {{the poem}} Þrymskviða, where he {{is referred to as}} the father of the goddess Freyja. In the poem, the jötunn Þrymr mistakenly thinks that he will be receiving the goddess Freyja as his bride, and while telling his fellow jötunn to spread straw on the benches in preparation for the arrival of Freyja, he refers to her as the daughter of Njörðr of Nóatún. Towards the end {{of the poem}} Sólarljóð, Njörðr is cited as having nine daughters. Two of the names of these <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> given; the eldest Ráðveig and the youngest Kreppvör.|$|E
5|$|Robinson became Canon to the Ordinary in 1988, the {{executive}} {{assistant to the}} then bishop of New Hampshire, Douglas Theuner. Robinson remained in this job for the next seventeen years until he was elected bishop. Robinson and his <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> very close. Ella actively helped her father with public relations at the General Convention in 2003. Just {{a week before the}} General Convention, Robinson had been with his daughter Jamee and held his four-hour-old first granddaughter. He now has two granddaughters.|$|E
5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry. Because he {{represents}} bourgeois wealth acquired through trade– and not aristocratic primitive accumulation– his <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E

5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, where they are fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> identified as Maternal Qualities (in French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals the lemon trees have been pruned.|$|E
5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays {{in health care}} access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
40|$|Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) in {{a mother}} and <b>daughter</b> <b>are</b> reported. This entity has a primary and {{secondary}} form. In this case, the 23 -year-old mother died 11 months after delivery with findings of EFE. At age 3 ½ years, the <b>daughter</b> <b>was</b> admitted in congestive heart failure and {{did not respond to}} medical management. The autopsy findings revealed EFE. Endocardial fibroelastosis in both mother and <b>daughter</b> <b>is</b> a very rare finding...|$|R
50|$|Al-Nahdiah had a <b>daughter,</b> {{whose father}} <b>is</b> unnamed. It is {{sometimes}} asserted that Al-Nahdiah's <b>daughter</b> <b>was</b> named Umm Umays. This {{is due to}} the ambiguous wording of Ibn Saad's account. However, Ibn Ishaq makes it clear that Umm Umays and Al-Nahdiah's <b>daughter</b> <b>were</b> two different people.|$|R
50|$|Constantina and {{all three}} of her <b>daughters</b> <b>were</b> {{executed}} at Chalcedon. Germanus and his unnamed <b>daughter</b> <b>were</b> also executed {{on the island of}} Prote. The <b>daughter</b> had <b>been</b> the widow of Theodosius. Theophanes places the deaths in 605/606 but the exact date is in doubt. The Chronicon Paschale reports that all six were decapitated.|$|R
5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, but that also greatly diminishes the cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha <b>daughters</b> <b>are</b> near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E
