40|$|Hydro Dynamics, Inc. {{received}} a technical helping hand from NASA that made their <b>Hydrosonic</b> Pump (HPump) a reality. Marshall engineers resolved a bearing {{problem in the}} rotor of the pump and recommended new bearings, housings and mounting hardware as a solution. The resulting HPump is able to heat liquids with greater energy efficiency using shock waves to generate heat...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in both theory and experimental techniques have greatly contributed {{to our understanding}} of the stress state in the sample under non hydrostatic compresses in a diamond anvil cell. The analysis of the lattice straines measured under such a stress state gives information on the shelf stress ans single-crystal elastic moduli as function of pressure. The equation of state corresponding to a <b>hydrosonic</b> compression can be also obtain from the lattice strains measured under non-hydrostatic compression. The effect on the lattice strains of departures from the assumed experimental conditions is discussed in this article...|$|E

That year he {{produced}} the track [...] "Comin For You" [...] for rap artist Reach, which {{was chosen by}} a panel of judges including DJ Premier for Scion's NextUp competition. That same year he received international recognition in Scratch Magazine's <b>Hydrosonic's</b> section.|$|R
