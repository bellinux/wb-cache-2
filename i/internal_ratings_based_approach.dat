40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{factors which}} have prompted {{the need for}} further revision of banking regulation, with particular reference to the Capital Requirements Directive. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which comprises the 2006 / 48 /EC Directive on the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and the 2006 / 49 /EC Directive on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions, implemented the revised framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II) within EU member states. Pro cyclicality has attracted a lot of attention – particularly with regards to the recent financial crisis, owing to concerns arising from increased sensitivity to credit risk under Basel II. This paper not only considers whether such concerns are well-founded, but also the beneficial and not so beneficial consequences emanating from Basel II’s increased sensitivity to credit risk (as illustrated by the <b>Internal</b> <b>Ratings</b> <b>Based</b> <b>approaches).</b> In so doing it considers the effects of Pillar 2 of Basel II, namely, supervisory review, with particular reference to buffer levels, and whether banks’ actual capital ratios can be expected to correspond with Basel capital requirements given {{the fact that they are}} expected to hold certain capital buffers under Pillar 2. Furthermore, it considers how regulators can respond to prevent systemic risks to the financial system during periods when firms which are highly leveraged become reluctant to lend. In deciding to cut back on lending activities, are the decisions of such firms justified in situations where such firms’ credit risk models are extremely and unduly sensitive - hence the level of capital being retained is actually much higher than minimum regulatory Basel capital requirements ?...|$|R

This study evaluates the ability of a parametric fractional response regression and a nonparametric regression tree model to forecast bank loan credit losses. The out-of-sample predictive ability of these models is evaluated at several recovery horizons after the default event. The out-of-time predictive ability is also estimated for a recovery horizon of one year. The performance of the models is benchmarked against recovery estimates given by historical averages.

As risk-taking incentives become more important, the optimal portfolio size of banks adopting intern rating systems will be increasingly constrained, and ultimately they may lose market share relative to banks using the standard approach.

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} intended to build {{a link between the}} regulatory requirements given by the Basel II capital accord and an internal Credit risk model. Based on model assumptions for the internal and external rating structure, the regulatory <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> and the CreditMetrics TM methodology are applied for a bond portfolio. The characteristic risk parameters of the internal model are extracted from the loss distribution which results from Monte Carlo simulations of correlated scenarios. On the level of single positions the relationship between these results and the risk values following from the analytic formulas of the capital requirement can be described {{with the use of a}} power law. This enables to connect both approaches and to account for portfolio effects within the regulatory framework.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} analyze the common assumption, made by many credit risk models such as the Moody's KMV Loss-Calc model, of a ß distribution for the loss-given default (LGD). The paper shows that this assumption does not perform well in constructing analytic prediction intervals for LGD. Design/methodology/approach – Simulation experiments were conducted to highlight the potential problems associated with this distributional assumption in constructing prediction intervals for LGD. Findings – The simulation experiments show that, when starting from a different assumption concerning the shape of the population distribution, the beta distribution does not perform well in constructing prediction intervals for LGD. Originality/value – The analysis performed in this study addresses a relevant subject.

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{addresses the}} gap between the theoretically well-understood impact of systematic risk on the loss-distribution of a credit-risky loan portfolio and the lack of empirical estimates of the default correlation. To this purpose we start with a one-factor model in which the correlation with the systematic risk factor equals the asset correlation between two firms. The asset correlation is estimated from time series of ten years with default histories of 53280 German companies. The sample is divided into categories that are homogenous with respect to default probability (PD) and firm size. In this way we can explore to what extent correlations depend on these two factors. Several economic explanations why asset correlation depends on size and PD are discussed. The empirical analysis is motivated as well by current proposals for the <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> of the new Basel Accord.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Internal</b> <b>Ratings</b> <b>Based</b> (IRB) <b>approach</b> {{introduced}} in the Basel II Accord requires financial institutions to estimate not just the probability of default, but also the Loss Given Default (LGD), i. e., {{the proportion of the}} outstanding loan that will be lost {{in the event of a}} default. However, modelling LGD poses substantial challenges. One of the key problems in building regression models for estimating the loan-level LGD in retail portfolios such as mortgage loans relates to the difficulty of modelling their distributions, as they typically contain extensive numbers of zeroes. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed where a mixed discrete-continuous model for the total loss amount incurred on a defaulted loan is developed. The model accommodates the probability of a zero loss and the loss amount given that a loss occurs simultaneously. The approach is applied to a large dataset of defaulted home mortgages from a UK bank and compared to two well-known industry approaches. Our zero-adjusted gamma model is shown to present an alternative and competitive approach to LGD modelling...|$|R

40|$|The rating-sensitive {{capital charges}} on credit risks {{under the new}} Basel Accord are likely to {{increase}} the volatility of minimum capital requirements, which may force banks to hold larger capital cushions in excess of minimum requirements.

The results suggest that the size of the cushion depends on the bank’s credit portfolio risk and its chosen approach for calculating the minimum capital requirement. Although the more ratings-sensitive <b>internal</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> imposes lower minimum capital requirements on sufficiently high-quality credit portfolios than does the standardised approach, this capital relief is countered by the need for larger relative cushions under the former approach. The results imply that the cushions induced by greater rating sensitivity may influence both banks’ choices between proposed approaches for calculating capital requirements as well as the aggregate level of post-reform bank capital. Hence these cushions should be given due consideration in the final calibration of the Basel risk weights. new Basel Capital Accord; credit risk; internal ratings; value-at-risk...|$|E

The flexibility to determine LGD values tailored to a bank’s portfolio will likely be a motivation for a bank to want {{to move from the}} foundation to the advanced IRB approach. The appropriate degree of flexibility depends, of course, on what a bank knows about LGD broadly and about differentiated LGDs in particular; consequently supervisors must be able to evaluate “what a bank knows. ” The key issues around LGD are: 1) What does LGD mean and what is its role in IRB? 2) How is LGD defined and measured? 3) What drives differences in LGD? 4) What approaches can be taken to model or estimate LGD? By surveying the academic and practitioner literature, with supportive examples and illustrations from public data sources, this paper is designed to provides basic answers to these questions. The factors which drive significant differences in LGD include place in the capital structure, presence and quality of collateral, industry and timing of the business cycle...|$|R
