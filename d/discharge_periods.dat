The reservoir stores water during dry period of six months and water increases during the period when Indian subcontinent receives signif i cant rainfall. Significant modification of organic matter was noticed during storage period indicated by decrease in pH from 7. 5 to 6. 4 and oxygen saturation from ~ 95 % to 65 %. The relationship of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with oxygen saturation, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and isotopic ratios of DIC suggest s that heterotrophic activities are {{the major source of}} inorganic carbon to the reservoir. In addition to this, ground water exchange also contributes significantly to the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir. Nutrients released due to decomposition of organic matter in the reservoir supports both autotrophic and heterotrophic activities. The pCO 2 levels in the reservoir varied between 3944 and 16, 042 μatm and higher pCO 2 levels were noticed during peak <b>discharge</b> <b>period.</b> The annual mean CO 2 fluxes from the reservoir amounted to 112 ± 126 mmolC m - 2 · d - 1 and ~ 6 times higher fluxes were noticed during <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> compared to dry period and such high fluxes during <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> were contributed by both high pCO 2 levels and winds.

Emitted powers of EUV light and deposited powers to the charged species were simulated by varying the values of four key parameters, which include the driving frequency, gas pressure, gap distance and number of dielectric layers.

40|$|Background: Lochia is {{the slight}} vaginal {{bleeding}} between 24 hour to 12 week after delivery. There isn't any standard definition for difference between normal and abnormal lochia in post-partum period. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the relationship between ultrasonic findings of the postpartum uterus after normal vaginal delivery with the duration of lochia discharge. Methods: In this cross-sectional study was done in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from 2014 to 2015. In this study 160 women with non-complicated vaginal delivery were entered. Inclusion criteria were: Term pregnancy with gestational age >  37, singleton fetus with cephalic presentation. Exclusion criteria were pre-term pregnancies, previous Cesarean section or other uterine surgeries and twin fetuses. Transvaginal ultrasound was done in first 48 hours after delivery, endometrial thickness echogenicity and uterine size was evaluated. Maternal age, parity, duration of labor and neonatal weight were evaluated. Then the mothers were followed for 6 weeks. The quality and the quantity of lochia discharge were asked by the phone. Results: Lochial discharge last more than 6 weeks in 96 out of 160 (60 %). One had less than 4 weeks. The uterus length, thickness, height and endometrial length did not show any relationship with the duration of lochial discharge, but endometrial strip thickness significantly correlated with the duration of lochial <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 04). None of clinical variables like the number of gravidity, parity, live birth or child birth weight, were correlated to the duration of lochia <b>discharge</b> <b>period,</b> but the labor time was correlated to the duration of lochia <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (P= 0. 04). Although both endometrial thickness and labor time in univariate analysis were correlated to the lochia duration time but this was true just for endometrial thickness in multivariate analysis.

40|$|Adult dogs, anaesthetized by thiopental sodium, were used. The right {{cervical}} vagus was cut peripherally to ganglion nodosum in {{the upper}} part of the neck and the peripheral stump was separated untill the afferent nerve fibres originating from the receptor in the gastric wall showed the unitary spike. The stomach was distended with the air-charged balloon. From such fibre preparations, impulses during maintained gastric distension were recorded. In some fibres, burst and pause of discharge recurred periodically. Such type of discharge pattern was described here as periodically intermittent discharge, in which the relation between gastric distension and impulse activity was pursued. Therein, gastric distension was represented by gastric content in terms of volume and impulse activity by the total number of impulses during stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> (sum of the duration of burst and pause of discharge) from following two reasons. Firstly, analysis of discharge pattern showed that, when the degree of stomach distension became higher, the duration of burst of discharge became longer, that of pause shorter, while stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> showed only slight change. Secondly, experiments suggested that, in the fibres in which the response to maintained distension of the stomach was expected to be a slowly adapting discharge, the above-mentioned type of discharge pattern came into existence under the influence of peristaltic movement in and around the site of the receptor. Thus, the relation between the increase of gastric content and that of total number of impulses during stomach <b>discharge</b> <b>period</b> was found nearly proportional and two sorts of values, 22. 5 impulses/ 50 cc and 161 impulses/ 50 cc, were regarded as proportional constant...|$|R
40|$|<b>Discharge</b> <b>periods</b> of {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} significantly reduced at subzero centigrade temperatures. The reduction {{is more than}} what can be expected due to decreased rates of various processes caused by a lowering of temperature and occurs {{despite the fact that}} active materials are available for discharge. It is proposed that the major cause for this is the freezing of the electrolyte. The concentration of acid decreases during battery discharge with a consequent increase in the freezing temperature. A battery freezes when the discharge temperature falls below the freezing temperature. A mathematical model is developed for conditions where charge-transfer reaction is the rate-limiting step, and Tafel kinetics are applicable. It is argued that freezing begins from the midplanes of electrodes and proceeds toward the reservoir in-between. Ionic conduction stops when one of the electrodes freezes fully and the time taken to reach that point, namely the discharge period, is calculated. The predictions of the model compare well to observations made at low current density C/ 5 and at − 20 and − 40 °C. At higher current densities, however, diffusional resistances become important and a more complicated moving boundary problem needs to be solved to predict the <b>discharge</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|E

Spatial dynamics of solute chemistry and natural abundance isotopes of nitrate ( 15 N and 18 O) were examined in 6 locations and the watershed outlet in 2001 and 2002. Temporal dynamics were examined during 5 discharge periods: winter, snowmelt, spring, summer, and fall, which were based on discharge levels at the outlet. Solute concentrations were statistically significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) among stream sampling locations and <b>discharge</b> <b>periods,</b> with no interaction effects. Groundwater sources located in upper watershed controlled stream chemistry at higher elevations with highest pH, Ca 2 +, sum of base cations, Si, NO 3 -, total N, and SO 4 2 - and lowest Al concentrations. Two low elevation wetlands had a substantial influence over stream chemistry at those locations contributing lowest NO 3 -, total N, and highest DOC and DON. Snowmelt exhibited among the lowest pH, sum of base cations, and SO 4 2 -, and highest NO 3 -, total N, DON, and total Al; snowmelt appeared to dilute groundwater, and flush stored soil-derived solutes. Summer discharge, composed mainly of groundwater, exhibited the lowest flow, among the highest Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and lowest DON, DOC, and total Al concentrations. Isotopic analysis together with patterns of NH 4 + versus NO 3 - dynamics indicated that NO 3 - was microbial, generated in fall and accumulated in winter in upper watershed soils, and flushed to stream during high discharge events. Highest discharge in snowmelt 2001, a summer drought in 2002, and fall storms following the drought were further evaluated for their specific effects on stream chemistry. Snowmelt 2001 had the lowest pH and highest NO 3 -, base flow during summer drought had the lowest total Al, and storms in fall 2002 had highest SO 4 2 - of all periods, but all other solute concentrations were comparable to other <b>discharge</b> <b>periods</b> in this study.
