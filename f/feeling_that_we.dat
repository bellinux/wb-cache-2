Then we saw {{a great deal of}} each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other.

500|$|Recording for Blur's next album {{began in}} London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the {{sessions}} moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, {{and then to}} Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Coxon said [...] "there were no rows" [...] and [...] " [...] just recognised the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed some time apart". Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, [...] "Don't Bomb When You Are the Bomb" [...] as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and {{was part of the}} band's protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be [...] "a rockin' record", and also said that it has [...] "a lot of finely crafted pop songs". Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down; however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, {{to make sure}} there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were really tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story.

TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{different}} approach to the dilemma is that of incompatibilists, namely, that if the world is deterministic then, our <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are free to choose an action is simply an illusion. Metaphysical libertarianism is the form of incompatibilism which posits that determinism is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will). This view is associated with non-materialist constructions, including both traditional dualism, as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; {{such as the ability}} to consciously veto an action or competing desire. Yet even with physical indeterminism, arguments have been made against libertarianism in {{that it is difficult to}} assign Origination (responsibility for [...] "free" [...] indeterministic choices).|$|E

Stoupe's production is heavy yet musical, and Paz's rhymes are intelligent yet accessible, his voice rough yet his delivery smooth. Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell is the collaboration of two talented musicians who can create a nearly flawless album in which each track can stand on its own, but is more powerful as a whole, as an exploration of pain and hatred, of those <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> often don't wish to address but that, thanks to Jedi Mind Tricks, will be addressed for us.|$|R

50|$|The {{genesis of}} the make-believe theory {{can be found in}} Walton's 1978 paper 'Fearing Fictions', which {{addresses}} the Paradox of fiction i.e. how can we be moved by things that do not exist in the case of fiction? Walton's solution is to accept that our responses to fiction are genuine emotions, but to deny that they correspond to the conventional <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> refer to - rather, it is fictional that they are the conventional emotions. So, for instance, when a person who has watched a horror movie declares that they felt afraid, it is true that they were emotionally moved, but fictional that what they were moved to was fear. Walton refers to these fictional emotions as quasi emotions.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a defense}} is {{properly}} clarified, both patient and therapist {{can work together}} against it, because it represents an obstacle to the therapeutic task of getting to the patient's true feelings. A defense {{which has not been}} clarified is still invisible to the patient. It is also important to note that in childhood, defenses can be a useful tool in emotionally overwhelming or traumatic situations. According to Los Angeles-based psychiatrist Katherine Watkins, M.D. “defenses such as dissociation and repression can shield us from intense <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are developmentally unprepared to experience and process. However as we grow up, this shielding cuts us off from our full range of feelings, even when we are now emotionally able to handle the feelings.” ...|$|R

He said that there were loyalty issues of publicly supporting a government while knowing that a coup was underway, but that it was [...] "greatly offset by the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had been had by these people". Colby agreed with his colleagues that Richardson's removal was a major factor, regarding it as [...] "a policy decision just to indicate the end of a close relationship with Nhu". Richardson was close to Diem and the CIA provided both technical assistance and financing to Nhu's Special Forces. Trueheart insisted that Richardson had to be recalled so that Lodge could show that he spoke for the White House. Trueheart commented [...] "This was a clear signal, the only kind of really believable signal he could give".|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who hold}} this {{interpretation}} {{argue that this}} aspect of Ozu's work gives it its universality, and helps it transcend the specifically Japanese cultural {{context in which the}} films were created. Bock writes: [...] "The subject matter of the Ozu film is what faces all of us born of man and woman and going on to produce offspring of our own: the family… [...] may be applied to Ozu’s works and create an illusion of peculiar Japaneseness, but in fact behind the words are the problems we all face in a life cycle. They are the struggles of self-definition, of individual freedom, of disappointed expectations, of the impossibility of communication, of separation and loss brought about by the inevitable passages of marriage and death." [...] Bock suggests that Ozu’s wish to portray the life cycle affected his decisions on technical matters, such as the construction and use of the sets of his films. [...] "In employing the set like a curtainless stage Ozu allows for implication of transitoriness in the human condition. Allied with the other aspects of ritual in Ozu's techniques, it reinforces the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are watching a representative life cycle." ...|$|E
