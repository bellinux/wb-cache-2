50|$|The Chapel is a {{rectangular}} building, {{consisting of a}} nave and a small side porch on {{the eastern end of}} the south facade of the building. The building has a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof which is gabled at the eastern and western ends with overhanging <b>eaves.</b> The <b>eave</b> <b>overhang</b> continues to form a roof for the porch, giving the otherwise symmetrical building, an asymmetrical form as the roof overhangs much further on the southern edge than on the northern. A timber battened panel is attached to the upper section plain barge boards of the gables on the east and west facades of the building.|$|R
50|$|Log cabins were {{constructed}} {{with either a}} purlin roof structure or a rafter roof structure. A purlin roof consists of horizontal logs that are notched into the gable-wall logs. The latter are progressively shortened to form the characteristic triangular gable end. The steepness of the roof {{was determined by the}} reduction in size of each gable-wall log as well as the total number of gable-wall logs. Flatter roofed cabins might have had only 2 or 3 gable-wall logs while steeply pitched roofs might have had as many gable-wall logs as a full story. Issues related to <b>eave</b> <b>overhang</b> and a porch also influenced the layout of the cabin.|$|R

50|$|The Hoyts cinema Centre, {{designed}} in 1966 and completed in 1969 is considered unique {{due to the}} shape of the building, taking similar traits to an upside down oriental pagoda was seen to be of considerable interest in the local area. In fact the design was based on a structural idea of bracketing each floor out similar {{to the way in which}} very wide <b>eave</b> <b>overhangs</b> were created in Chinese and Japanese roofs. The interior of the cinema Centre, being decorated with natural surfaces such as timber wall and ceiling surfacing has a ‘subterranean’ feel to many of its spaces. Careful articulation of natural lighting and indoor planter boxes adds to this ambiance. Muller believed in using natural surfaces, so there is minimal use of synthetic surfaces on the complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{structural}} design and elevation are with towers or domes with single (ekathala) to triple (trithala) towers, which present a unique exhibition of South Indian Dravidian architecture. The chiseling {{done by the}} stone sculptors are occasional along joints between the stones. The walls are arranged and sequentially partitioned. The projections and recesses in these walls {{give the appearance of}} a set of shallow pilasters. The niches created in the walls are of rectangular shape and have carved sculptures of gods, demi-gods and the kings. The skirting around the images are of wild aquatic animals with “foliated tails and open jaws.” The wall pilasters have curved brackets, and columns on the porch provide support to an overhanging eave; arch windows occasionally carved with images are located above them. The mouldings culminate in parapets. The carvings above the <b>eave</b> <b>overhangs</b> are decorated roof forms in miniature size, which are seen in rows all round each of the structure.|$|R
5000|$|The 3500 sq ft, one-story main {{residence}} {{was one of}} the first structures built in 1909 - 1910. Its walls were covered with Atoka sandstone, which was quarried on the ranch. Hence, the house was always known as [...] "Rock Manor" [...] or [...] "Rock House." [...] The architecture is Prairie Style, and has the darker stone laid at the bottom of the elevation, becoming lighter as the exterior walls reach the roofline. The hipped roof is low-pitched and covered with asphalt shingles, interrupted by two front-facing dormers. Each dormer has white clapboard walls and two windows, with three small glass panes over one larger pane. The wide <b>eave</b> <b>overhang</b> is enclosed with a wooden fascia and a tongue-in-groove wooden soffit. There are three brick chimneys penetrating through the roof. One chimney is on the center ridge and connects to the living room fireplace. The other two are on the roof slopes, serving four wood stoves (kitchen, dining room and two bedrooms).|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{extensively}} remodeled in the Italianate-style {{prior to the}} American Civil War, with a three-story brick tower being added, the front columns changed to the Ionic order, brackets being added to the <b>eaves</b> and <b>overhangs,</b> and two-story cast iron side porches to each side. [...] John Drish died in 1867, reportedly from a fall down a stairway, and Sarah Drish died in 1884.|$|R

The home's physical appearance is very similar to its original appearance, besides a garage added to the property's rear in 1951 there have been no major alterations since the original spate of construction.|$|R
50|$|The eaves are {{the edges}} of the roof which {{overhang}} the face of a wall and, normally, project beyond the side of a building. The <b>eaves</b> form an <b>overhang</b> to throw water clear of the walls and may be highly decorated as part of an architectural style; such as the Chinese dougong bracket systems.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years, {{municipalities}} {{across the country have}} embraced neighborhood conservation districts, regulations that impose design standards at the neighborhood level. Despite their adoption in thirty-five states, in municipalities from Boise to Cambridge, neighborhood conservation districts have evaded critical analysis by legal scholars. By regulating features such as architectural style, roof angle, and maximum <b>eave</b> <b>overhang,</b> conservation districts purport to protect “neighborhood character” or “cultural stability. ” Implicit in these regulations is the unsupported assumption that the essential feature of a neighborhood’s character is its architectural design at a single point in time. The unfortunate result is zoning as taxidermy, rather than land-use planning that permits places to evolve to meet changing needs and preferences. Conservation districts freeze places in time, exclude would-be residents from desirable neighborhoods, and threaten to increase the cost of housing in those neighborhoods and the cities in which they are located. Urban culture is defined by dynamism, vitality, and an ability to adapt to and accommodate population and market shifts. Conservation district regulations should be crafted in that same spirit, to preserve cities and suburbs as places amenable to change. They should not only permit but also promote investment and redevelopment, particularly redevelopment of neighborhoods that, because they are close to public amenities, are well suited to dense development. This Article urges state legislators to cabin local authority to enact conservation districts. Revisions to state zoning-enabling legislation can ensure that these regulations (i) are not exclusionary, (ii) are responsive to changing market dynamics and evolving consumer preferences, and (iii) do not artificially inflate housing prices...|$|R

50|$|The Moore House is {{an example}} of the mature American Craftsman style {{architecture}} in the University Heights Historic District which combines traditional woodwork, design and craftsmanship while adapting features that were in style during the period. It was built in 1912 by a well-known local carpenter, contractor and architect, Charles E. Marks. It exemplifies his influence to the American Craftsman style and also, Prairie School design that was emerging in Madison during that time period. Often compared to Claude and Starck homes, the Moore house has a symmetrical main façade with two matching dormers on the third floor, multi-paned windows and wide <b>overhangs</b> <b>eaves.</b> The exterior façade also mixes wide plank cedar siding on the main floor which transitions to the traditional shake features on the second floor. In addition, Marks built multiple roof lines and bump-outs which give the house a sense of the floor plan within. The interior design features an entrance with heavy oak features. Marks took advantage of local immigrants who were skilled in woodworking from the old country and incorporated their skillful trade throughout the house. During this period, it was common to use solid paneled doors between rooms and entryways. Marks, with his eye for carpentry, had intricate custom made multi-glass paneled pocket and entry doors made for the Moore House which makes this house unique to itself. Marks also enlarged the main staircase which was common in larger homes of this time.|$|R
5000|$|Cone LibraryApart from {{residence}} halls, the Cone Library is {{the first}} single purpose academic building constructed on campus. [...] Raymond Whitaker designed the building that was constructed by H. George Schloemer in 1958 for $250,000. The 186 by 40 ft Modern structure follows an irregular rectangular plan and is dominated by large plate glass windows. The main facade of the building is divided into eight bays with the main entrance just off center. The entrance bay is set off by stone. The building's mottled red face brick is laid in American bond with a header course on every sixth course. Another dominate feature of the building are the deep <b>eaves</b> that <b>overhang</b> the walls. Along {{the upper part of}} the wall is a wide band of stone. The window lintels are likewise stone. There are also three basement level windows in each bay, save for the entrance bay. The east side of the south elevation is composed of solid brick with no windows. It features a decorative cut stone design that portrays Marycrest's insignia that is embedded in the wall. It was created by Sister Mary Clarice Ebert, CHM who taught in the college's art department. The front section of the main level of the interior was divided into three large rooms. They were separated by wood and glass panel walls. The periodical reading room was on the north, the main desk and card catalog was in the center, and the reference reading room was on the south. The stacks were located across the back of the building. The basement originally housed the student union in the south half and an audio-visual room, alumnae office, and receiving room on the north. [...] Walsh HallRaymond Whitaker was already in retirement when he designed Walsh Hall with the assistance of Kenneth Wagner. It was completed in 1964 by O. Jorgensen & Sons of Clinton for $650,000. [...] The four-story structure housed science classrooms and laboratories. The 162 by 72 ft building follows a rectangular plan with its main facade on the west elevation. The exterior brick is laid in American bond with a header course set between every fifth course. Parapet walls capped with stone rise above a flat roof. Brick piers separate the bays. The main facade is five bays while the side elevations are eight bays. The west elevation is composed of the main entrance in the center bay with windows similar to others found in the building above it. The center bay is flanked by two bays with a single column of windows centered in the bay. There is a combination of single, paired and triple window units in the building. The east elevation features window groupings similar to those found on the north elevation. The south elevation features an unusual arrangement of windows and stone panels that form a cross in the center bay. The clustered window groups have stone sills, frames and mullions. The stone beltcourses on each floor double as window lintels.|$|R

In the history of thousand of years human beings, {{one of the most}} important objectives of is constructing the naturalhabitation based on their needs. Just like all the living things in nature, mankind also effort a lot to protect themselves from thenatural envoirement conditions. In the history of residence which originated with the humanitarian history, starting from thedwellings carved into the rocks, the residence culture brought from Central Asia survived at the residence of Ottoman era and thevery best samples of Turkish Residence Architecture builted during this age. Residental Architecture in late period of OttamanEmpire has gained a new dimension with the foreign decoration style. The traditional identity shaped by the cultural values brought from Central Asia that are melted togetwer with the severalcultures in Anatolia as well as the the influence of Islam. The urban architecture and ornamentation effected by the provincialcapital style has never been studied so far. The folk architecture has survived as a matter of distictive subject. Our study of OldTurkish Houses covers Ilvat and neighborhood villages also consist of the village houses in Buyuk Ilvat, Belen Ilvat, Bucak Ilvatand Sarihacilar. The regional houses,feature more traditional characteristic, are explored and evaluated for the first time with this studyemerged as the best samples of folk architectured displayed. The houses in our study evaluated by taking into considerataion the material, construction technique, project and ornamentstyles. The main raw material in the construction of these regional housed are stone and timber. Metals as raw metarial is notcommon. Metals can be seen on window fences, door knobs, lock and hinges. Brick almost never used at any houses explored. The top cover of the houses are Turkish Style roof tiles. The plaster used in coating the oven and the fixture of illuminant. The soil only used in grout which is no longer available. The building structures constructed by the matarials widely available in theregion. While all the walls in the house builted with the groutless dry wall technique that is wooden beams mounted between therubble stones and compressed peşdunavs, in the resort part of the houses wooden curtain walls can be seen. The upper cover ofthe house is pitched roof and coated with Turkish Style roof tiles. Carriers such as console units, hands in hips and wooden pillarsused in the ascent, eaves, restrooms and summerhouses. Soil and Stone furnishings can be seen in the courtyard and ground floorof the house whereas the upper floors completely made of timber. Almost all the doors of the houses in the region made ofwooden. The courtyard and main entences doors are double-winged, room doors are single and multilayer. The sighseeingwindows of the regional houses are latticed inside and shuttered outside. The room Windows ar evice versa (latticed outside andshuttered inside). The connection between the floors done by the wooden stairways. The houses in Akseki Ilvat and Sarihacilar village can be classified into three groups according to project types. As well as the climate and natural conditions the influential folk architecture has a great effect on formation of the projecttypes. The basic spaces form the project are hall and the rooms. The first type houses are the most comman ones with outer hall. Those houses are also divided into 2 groups as ouetr hall with eyvan and outer hall without eyvan. Ouetr hall with eyvan projecttype houses are generally constructed by highly welfared individuals and regulated for crowded families. Compared to the otherhouses the number of rooms and the ornamentary increased. Second type houses are the ones with iner halls. Third types are theones with middle hall. The last two types are not comman in practice in the region. The execution of those two project types areseen only in one sample. Generally the basic element forms the front-line in the region is the overhangs. These overhangs areembodied according the direction of the halls. Can be grouped as overhangs on the right, overhangs on the left and overhangs inthe middle acording to the location of the averhangs based on the enterence door. The overhangs are carried by wooden pillarsand hand in hips. The cover of the overhangs are laid with tiles regardless of the roof. The windows of the overhangs aregenerally latticed with outer shutter. The windows of the overhangs decareted with lattices are distinguished with different typesof lattices. Some lattices divided into four trays and an observation window is built. Some lattices are built complete and there areskylight windows above. Room windows are rectangular lattice form and shuttered inside. The double-wing and multilayerenterence door of the houses placed under the <b>overhangs.</b> <b>Eaves</b> of the houses is made of timber and the outside ornaments areplain. One of the important element in the front-line is the chimneys. The chimneys are squared stone masonry and conical hat. The summerhouses is another element that activates the front-line. The summerhouses are open air places that are carried bywooden pillars. In the explored houses the interior decoration has wider application area, the outside ornament is more modest. The outerornament is concentrated on overhangs and windows, the interior ornament can be seen on pavilion, room doors, ceilings,cupboards and wardrobes as an accurate samples. Almost every room of the regional houses has a cupboard closet. Generally the top of the cupboard and closets are divided bytimber trays and the inside of the trays left blank. The bigger houses constructed by higher income individuals the timber trays ofcupborad and closet are filled with herbal charesteristic decorative motives. In interior decoration specifically the room doors has accurate ornament features. These single-wing doors are divided bytimber trays on top. The insdie of the timber trays are decorated by geometric and herbal forms ornament motives. Just like in the cupboards there is timber tray ornament in the open cabinets in the top of the rooms. The inside of the traysare sometimes kept blank and sometimes decorated with rose motifs and four leaf clover. One of the most important areas in theornament of the room is ceilings. The room ceilings in the regional houses are generally flat timber with lower hammerset. A hubin the shape of eight or rarely six armed star form placed in the middle of the ceiling which is perpendicularly divided to squaresby timber laths. In the middle of the hub there are motives of eight armed star narrowing throught the center, branch and rarelystylized tulip. In the center heaven fruit pomegranate, the symbol of abundance and blessing, appliquied as embossed. It can beseen ellips and round ceilings in some houses, howevere the comman ones are the flat ceilings hubbed with eight armed star. Round ceilings generally filled with timber strips in a shape of sun disc motive. When compared to plain and sloppy constructed urban houses, the regional houses built highly ornate and elaborate. Althought the regional houses are a product of folk architecture, refletcs the capital fashion in project type, front line allignment,glamorious and ornaments. The main reason is because of the finacial power and the status of the owners. The local craftsmen,lived in the region and experinced the capital fashion, had a great role in evolving this synthesis architecture. Houses mostlyconstructed in early 20. Centuryare being restored along with the Akseki-Ibradi Disctrict Development Plan. The restored housedare really in good conditions. Only the repairs done by the owners do not resulted succesfully. Those repiars cause the loss oforiginality. Nowadays, those houses, especially the non resident ones, which have great importance in Traditional ResidentArchitecture are abandoned to the wild circumtances of nature...|$|R
