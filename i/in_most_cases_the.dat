5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were {{challenges to the}} Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some extent}} a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the country, people rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> challenges to the social order were quashed.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>The</b> myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse bones from ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack.

Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug was administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> {{electrons}} {{are close}} enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

Afterwards, by-elections were held in vacant constituencies to fill the vacant seats.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E

Such arms of one tincture create an atmosphere. Plain arms were rare in the 12th century, and were used in literature to suggest a primitive heraldry of a time long past. Geoffrey of Monmouth noted with favor that in the Arthurian age, worthy knights used arms of one color, suggesting 12th century heraldic ornamentation was partly pretence (Brault, 29).|$|E
5|$|The Council {{votes in}} one of three ways; unanimity, simple majority, or {{qualified}} majority. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> Council votes on issues by qualified majority voting, meaning that there must be a minimum of 55% of member states agreeing (at least 15) who together represent at least 65% of the EU population. A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona.

It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> documentation deals with a voluntary act {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E

5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> {{senators}} {{could only}} vote {{together with the}} sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power {{was limited to the}} deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, except on the senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the supervisory role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> {{owner and}} {{the driver of the}} chariot were {{different}} persons. In 416 BC, the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race, and came in first, second, and fourth; obviously, he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself. Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian, although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian. The poet Pindar did praise the courage of Herodotes of Thebes, however, for driving his own chariot. This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership, despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games. This happened rarely, but a notable example is the Spartan Cynisca, daughter of Archidamus II, who won the chariot race twice. Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games. The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
