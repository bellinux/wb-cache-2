The effects of drying time and conditioning time on measured moisture content values were studied and optimization of these parameters were done. Results of the moisture content measurement using these methods show a sufficiently linear relationship between measured moisture content and the proportion of viscose in the fabric samples. The regression analysis showed very high coefficients of determination (above 0. 98) in all cases. Regression equations were used to predict the blend proportion of fabric samples from the moisture content data. It was found that even the moisture content values using a shorter conditioning time of 60 minutes and even 10 minutes yielded correct prediction with a maximum error of magnitude less than 3. 0 in blend percentage values...|$|E

40|$|A new thermal {{protection}} system for atmospheric earth re-entry is proposed. This concept combines {{the advantages of}} both reusable and ablative materials {{to establish a new}} hybrid concept with advanced capabilities. The solution consists of the design and the integration of a dual shield resulting on the overlapping of an external thin ablative layer with a Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) thermo-structural core. This low density ablative material covers the relatively small heat peak encountered during re-entry the CMC is not able to bear. On the other hand the big advantage of the CMC based TPS is of great benefit which can deal with the high integral heat for the bigger time period of the re-entry. To verify the solution a whole testing plan is envisaged, which as part of it includes thermal shock test by <b>infra-red</b> <b>heating</b> (heating flux up to 1 MW/m 2) and vibration test under launcher conditions (Volna and Ariane 5).

However, the impact of temperature variations on networks of multiple devices is far less understood and requires investigation. We aim to close this gap and analyse the impact of temperature fluctuations on low-power wireless sensor networks, a key enabling technology of pervasive computing. As we are moving forward into an era of human-centric safety-critical applications (e. g., smart health and intelligent transportation systems), it is particularly important {{to make sure that}} a networked system offers a reliable and deterministic performance despite all possible temperature changes over its deployment lifetime. In this demo, we present a testbed infrastructure based on <b>infra-red</b> <b>heating</b> lamps that allows to vary the on-board temperature of sensor nodes on a large scale in a repeatable fashion. Using this experimental infrastructure, we show the effects of temperature variations on network performance in two different ways. First, in a small-scale local testbed at PerCom, we highlight the degradation of the wireless link quality at high temperatures, and show that the performance of radio transceivers is temperature-dependent. We quantify this degradation and parametrize the dependency between temperature and link quality using the signal strength information captured between four wireless sensor nodes. Second, we connect remotely to our large-scale experimental infrastructure at TU Graz, and assess the impact of temperature variations on the performance of state-of-the-art network protocols, showing that the typical outdoor temperature fluctuations occurring during 24 -hours do affect key network metrics such as throughput, delay, and lifetime...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{analytical}} {{computational model}} {{was developed to}} predict Top Load and Side Load performance of oval containers. The performance of oval and other non round containers {{is dependent on the}} thickness distribution achieved during blow molding. Simulating blow molding and performance of containers using Virtual PrototypingTM Software and feeding the input for Finite Element Analysis provides an accurate mechanism to predict container performance. A 2402. generic oval container with aspect ratio of 1. 58 was simulated for empty and filled top load performance. A critical part of blow molding oval containers is the ability to achieve a more uniform thickness profile along the circumference of the container at any given height. This is achieved by using preferential heating where the <b>infra-red</b> <b>heating</b> ovens have special slotted reflector plates that allow the preform to be heated differently 90 " apart. For the 2402. oval container with a high aspect ratio it was observed that the use of preferential heating is necessary to achieve uniform thickness distribution in the range of 0. 3 mm- 0. 4 mm. A non preferentially heated preform resulted in container thickness being 0. 4 - 0. 6 mm in a concentrated region adjoining the minor axis. The preferentially heated performs resulted in containers having better empty and filled Top load. The side grip load was the only performance characteristic that was higher for the non preferentially heated containers but that works only in a small region and the non uniformity of thickness makes the container not aesthetically pleasing and would not be acceptable in a production process due to inconsistency in material distribution...|$|E

Body core and skin temperatures were measured as well as thermal comfort and thermal sensation of the hands, head and body. All heating conditions increased ambient car temperature above the control condition. Steer (4) and IR hand heating (6) were beneficial for the thermal sensation of the hand. Thermal sensation of the head was rated highest in the IR head condition (5). The chair condition (2) also scored quite well on heat thermal sensation, but mainly after the first 5 min. Overall thermal sensation was rated highest in the chair condition (2). The control (1) and sun shield (3) conditions were rated lowest, mainly after the first 5 min. Subjects indicated they hardly noticed the sun shield heating. Subjects felt most comfortable in the chair (2) and IR head condition (5). Regression analyses indicated that thermal comfort is related quite well to thermal sensation, especially of the total body. Thermal comfort and thermal sensation are poorly predicted by core and skin temperatures. It can be concluded that chair and IR head heating are most beneficial for overall thermal sensation and comfort, the latter working on a shorter term than the former.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of {{fossil fuel consumption}} and the associated decrease in greenhouse gas emissions are vital to combat global warming and this can be accomplished, in part, {{by the use of}} natural light to provide illumination in buildings. Demand for artificial lighting and the availability of daylight often correspond, so savings can be significant. To assess the performance of several innovative daylighting devices and to develop improved models for more established technology, quantitative measurement of output was necessary. This was achieved by the development of simply constructed photometric integrators which were calibrated by the innovative use of daylight as a source of illuminance. These devices were found to be consistent and accurate in measuring the luminous flux from a number of devices and in a number of locations. The novel light rod was assessed as a core daylighting technology and found to transmit light with high efficiency at aspect ratios of up to 40. It was found to have higher transmittance than the light pipe and with a considerably smaller diameter, could be used in space-restricted applications. Light rods were bent by <b>infra-red</b> <b>heating</b> and found to lose minimal transmittance. The light rod emitter was modified to give a variety of types of light distribution, including side emission and the results were visually and quantitatively assessed. Energy saving capacity was assessed and a model of performance developed for the first time. The long-term measurement of light pipe performance and measurement of length and diameter effects led to several improved models of performance for European latitudes. Several means of improving yield were investigated, including novel cone concentrators, laser cut panels and innovative high-efficiency reflective films. The concentrators and films were found to give significantly higher output than a standard light pipe, increasing energy savings and associated benefits for the user.

50|$|Thermal radiation, {{a common}} synonym for infra-red when it occurs at {{temperatures}} commonly encountered on Earth, {{is the process}} by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves.

The emitted wave frequency of the thermal radiation is a probability distribution depending only on temperature, and for a black body is given by Planck's law of radiation.

The plant extract increased the reaction time of the mice to radiant heat induced pain. All doses of the plant extract except the 800 mg/kg bwt dose showed the highest elevation of pain threshold at the 60 mins interval. The concentration of 1000 mg/kg body weight showed the highest elevation. Percentage inhibition was calculated as 27. 5 %, 20. 6 % and 44. 4 % for the three doses of the extract respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Petroleum mulch applied on {{the soil}} surface over a row of planted seeds {{promotes}} a more rapid and a more uniform germination of seeds, enhances elongation of seedlings {{and in some cases}} increases the yield of the crop. The beneficial effects of petroleum mulch have usually been attributed to increased soil temperatures below the mulch. Some reports have pointed out that evaporation of soil water is reduced {{as a result of the}} mulch application. An experimental arrangement was designed so that changes in soil temperature and soil water content of mulched and unmulched soil, subjected to the same radiation load could be measured under controlled conditions. Soil at a pre-determined water content was packed into boxes with inside dimensions of 4. 0 x 40. 0 x 48. 0 cm. A ten cm wide band of mulch was applied to one side of the slab leaving 30 cm of bare soil. The soil was subjected to a temperature cycle by turning on <b>infra-red</b> <b>heat</b> lamps at 8 : 00 A. M., increasing the energy output at hourly intervals with a variable transformer until 2 : 00 P. M. and then decreasing the energy output until the lights were turned off at 8 : 00 P. M. Soil temperatures were measured at two-hour intervals with calibrated thermistors inserted into the soil slab. Soil water content changes at selected points were measured at regular intervals with a collimated gamma-beam, movable in a vertical as well as a horizontal direction. The heat flux into the soil was measured with heat flux discs. It was observed that an application of petroleum mulch, changes the temperature and water regime of a soil. The mulch covered soil was about 5 °C warmer than the bare soil at the time the soil temperatures attained their maximum value. At all other times the temperature difference between mulched and bare soil was smaller. The bare soil rapidly lost water in the upper four centimeters. The mulch covered soil lost water in the upper cm of soil but gained water at depths below this zone. This gain in water was observed in the zone where seedlings are normally placed, indicating that the beneficial effect of petroleum mulch on germination and seedling growth must be attributed to improved soil water conditions as well as to improved soil temperature conditions...|$|R

During the deformation induced phase transformation to hcp iron, a subset of orientations are favored to transform to the hcp structure first and generate a texture of (01 - 10) at high angles to the compression direction. Upon further deformation, the remaining grains transform, resulting in a texture that obeys the Burgers relationship of (110) bcc // (0001) hcp. This is in contrast to high temperature results that indicate that texture is developed through dominant pyramidal { 2 - 1 - 12 } and basal (0001) -{ 2 - 1 - 10 } slip based on polycrystal plasticity modeling.

The area was made flat by having the subject prone with pillows packed under the abdomen, and temperatures were measured at the centre point of the area, 2 - 5 cm. {{to the right of the}} second lumbar vertebral spine. Skin temperature was recorded with two copper-constantan wire thermocouples (Whyte, 1951), and subcutaneous temperatures with needle thermocouples passed vertically into the region (Whyte and Reader, 1951). (a) Short-Wave Infra-Red Radiation. -This was supplied from a 1, 000 -watt tungsten filament lamp; * it was applied to a 12 x 12 cm. area in the maximum intensity whic...|$|R

40|$|Carbides and {{nitrides}} of d-group {{transition metals}} {{are classified as}} refractory hard material and their industrial importance has been recognized for long. In recent years, unique functionalities including catalytic function and superconductivity are discovered for this group of materials to raise serious attention of materials researchers and engineers to refractory carbides and nitrides as novel functional materials. Synthesis of refractory carbides and nitrides demands high temperature reaction route to consume considerable amount of electricity or gas in conventional industrial process. In view of saving cost of such conventional energy, feasibility of using concentrated solar beam as heat source for synthesizing carbide and nitride has been investigated by the authors since 1997. After verifying usefulness of concentrated solar beam as heat source for carbide forming reactions, similar attempts of employing concentrated solar beam as heat source for nitride synthesis were initiated recently. After brief experimental verification of nitride synthesis for IVa group metal, Ti, and Vg group metals, V, Nb and Ta, in N 2 gas environment under irradiation with concentrated solar beam to 2000 °C, the authors decided to undertake nitride synthesis of VIa group metals, Cr, Mo and W, {{as well as of}} Fe in stream of ammonia (NH 3) gas as a nitriding medium under irradiation of concentrated solar beam at temperatures not exceeding 1000 °C. NH 3 gas with suppressed extent of dissociation by flowing is defined empirically as uncracked NH 3 and it is proved to possess very high nitriding power to make synthesis of mono-nitride MoN of Mo coexisting with sub-nitride Mo and higher nitride Fe 2 N of Fe possible under normal pressure condition that are not possible when chemically stable N 2 gas is used as a nitriding agent. VIa-group metals including Cr, Mo and W are known to be highly resistant against nitriding. In the present report, results of nitriding in flowing NH 3 gas at a fixed flow rate 10 l/h (˜ 167 ml/min) under heating with concentrated solar beam for VIa-group metals, Cr, Mo and W, are summarized to demonstrate favorable effect of solar beam heating towards further enhancement of nitriding power of flowing NH 3 gas compared with the situation in conventional electric furnace in which visible light components except <b>infra-red</b> (IR) <b>heat</b> wave component are absent in the reaction system. ...|$|R
