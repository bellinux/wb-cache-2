5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom of each of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 June a force of about 50 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> slipped out of the Pocket and {{attempted}} to attack Australian positions on Labuan. Different groups of <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> attacked a prisoner of war enclosure, dock facilities and No. 1 Strip, but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers. A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|At 02:30 {{a second}} wave of about 150 to 200 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> again {{attacked}} across the sandbar and was again almost completely wiped out. At {{least one of the}} surviving Imperial officers from this attack advised Ichiki to withdraw his remaining forces, but Ichiki declined to do so.|$|E
5|$|Morotai was {{the scene}} of a number of {{surrender}} ceremonies following the surrender of Japan. About 660 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> on Morotai capitulated to Allied forces after 15 August. The 93rd Division also accepted the surrender of the 40,000 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> at Halmahera on 26 August after the Japanese commander there was brought to Morotai on a US Navy PT boat. On 9 September 1945, Australian General Thomas Blamey accepted the surrender of the Japanese Second Army at a ceremony held on the I Corps' sports ground at Morotai. Private Teruo Nakamura, the last confirmed Japanese holdout on Morotai or elsewhere, was captured by Indonesian Air Force personnel on 18 December 1974.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{had mixed}} success in {{mainland}} Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched {{the first of}} two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in the Hunan province.|$|E
5|$|Although some Japanese {{soldiers}} were taken prisoner, most fought {{until they were}} killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> defending Okinawa in April–June 1945, 94% were killed. American military leaders used these figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the hotel}} was {{occupied}} by <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops,</b> and the Japanese flag was flown above the walls for {{the entirety of the}} war. During the Battle for the Liberation of Manila, {{the hotel was}} set on fire by the Japanese. The shell of the building survived the blaze and the structure was later reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops.</b> Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, {{during the}} First Shanghai Incident, Izumo became the {{flagship}} {{of the newly}} re-established 3rd Fleet that garrisoned Japanese-occupied China. Two years later, she was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship participated in the Battle of Shanghai in mid-1937 during which she provided naval gunfire support to <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> ashore.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Bismarck Sea (2–4 March 1943) {{took place}} in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) during World War II when {{aircraft}} of the U.S. Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) attacked a <b>Japanese</b> convoy carrying <b>troops</b> to Lae, New Guinea.

5|$|In Tasimboko, Edson's troops {{discovered}} the supply base for Kawaguchi's forces, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a shortwave radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, {{and returned to}} the Lunga perimeter at 17:30. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3,000 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were on the island and apparently planning an attack.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{forces on}} Bougainville {{detected}} the Japanese buildup. Information on {{the movement of}} the 17th Army was gained from many sources, including signals intelligence, patrols conducted by US Army troops into the interior of the island, aerial and naval patrols as well as the interrogation of Japanese prisoners. In addition, <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were also detected around the outpost, which was held by the 1stFiji Battalion at Ibu {{to the north of the}} perimeter. In response, Allied aircraft attacked bridges and areas in which <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were believed to be located. United States Navy PT boats and Landing Craft Infantry gunboats supported by PBY Catalina aircraft also patrolled the coast of Bougainville and attacked Japanese barges, but were unable to stop the movement of supplies and equipment by sea. In addition, American warships and aircraft periodically bombarded the main Japanese bases on Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{first arrived}} in Timor in the 16th century, and in 1702 East Timor came under Portuguese colonial administration. Portuguese rule was tenuous until the island was divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860. A {{significant}} battleground during the Pacific War, East Timor was occupied by 20,000 <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops.</b> The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 East Timorese deaths.|$|E

5|$|The {{evacuation}} was code-named Operation Ke (ケ号作戦), and {{was scheduled}} to begin on 14 January 1943. An important element in the plan was an air superiority campaign starting 28 January 1943, to inhibit Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting {{the final stage of}} the Ke operation, which was the actual evacuation of all <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> from Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|While AIB patrols {{continued}} {{to report that}} no <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops</b> were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would be made by a combat-ready force protected by naval vessels. This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to provide useful experience for the units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to {{maintain}} pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing {{in an effort to}} draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae. In this they were completely successful; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of <b>Japanese</b> <b>troops,</b> including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area throughout the campaign. Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 Japanese soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in combat units.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle is}} {{generally}} considered to be a tactical and strategic victory for the U.S. because the Japanese lost more ships, aircraft, and aircrew, and <b>Japanese</b> <b>troop</b> reinforcements for Guadalcanal were delayed.
