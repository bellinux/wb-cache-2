There are four constant-crystallization <b>eutectic</b> points for hydrochloric acid, between the crystal form of HCl·H2O (68% HCl), HCl·2H2O (51% HCl), HCl·3H2O (41% HCl), HCl·6H2O (25% HCl), and ice (0% HCl).

40|$|The hybrid direct carbon {{fuel cells}} (DCFCs) have drawn wide {{attention}} in generating electrical energy directly from carbon. Recent {{research has shown}} promising high peak power density, however, no good stability performance of this hybrid DCFC was presented. One of the concerns relating to the present hybrid concept is the stability of solid electrolyte in contact with corrosive molten carbonates <b>eutectics.</b> In this study, high temperature exposure tests of YSZ and SDC in the molten carbonates <b>eutectics</b> were conducted to characterize the corrosion {{as well as the}} effect of different atmosphere conditions on the stability of YSZ and SDC using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reaction experiments with a mass spectrometer and AC impedance spectroscopy.

5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo <b>eutectic</b> reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo <b>eutectic</b> reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E

Addition of small {{proportions}} of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered {{as a way to}} store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors.

This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E

Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the <b>eutectic</b> salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the <b>eutectic</b> mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the <b>eutectic</b> mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the <b>eutectic</b> mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form many {{intermetallic}} compounds {{with each other}} and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, such as the sodium amalgams with mercury, including Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air.

Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (<b>eutectic</b> mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the <b>eutectic</b> water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the relationships among}} the chemical composition, microstructure and properties (hardness, micro-hardness, wear resistance) of powder additives based on NiCrBSi after their deposition. Tested materials reached a relatively wide range of hardness after deposition, which corresponds to their chemical composition and microstructure. The abrasive wear resistance of materials was tested on an emery cloth. The results indicate that both the hardness and abrasive wear resistance of tested materials depend especially {{on the content of}} carbon and chromium. Microstructural analysis indicates that the structure of tested materials is formed by the γ-Ni solid solution and intermediate phases based on boron, silicon and carbon. Those mostly form <b>eutectics</b> (three types), or are excluded by precipitation. There was also found a significant effect of chromium, but especially carbon content on the ratio between the solid solution and <b>eutectics</b> in the microstructure of tested materials.
