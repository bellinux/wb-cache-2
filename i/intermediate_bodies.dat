Cowdria divided by binary fission within intracytoplasmic vacuoles resulting in large colo-nies of reticulate bodies. After three to four days in culture, reticulate bodies developed into smaller <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> characterized by an electron-dense core.

However, extracellular elementary bodies were not detected. Another stock of Cowdria (W) showed an identical developmental cycle {{as that of the}} S stock.

Extinction risk in this group is also related to habitat and body size, being higher for species from non-forested habitats and of <b>intermediate</b> <b>body</b> size. We tested {{the extent to which the}} phylogenetic selectivity of extinction was explained by this ecological pattern. We found that while genus size and distinctiveness explain no variation in extinction risk that is not accounted for by habitat and body size, there is a significant residual association of genus age with extinction risk. This suggests that while species in small and distinctive genera are at high risk because they are overrepresented in non-forested habitats and <b>intermediate</b> <b>body</b> size classes, species in old genera are at higher risk over the range of body sizes and habitats and may be intrinsically vulnerable to extinction...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a general {{framework for the}} manual teleoperation of kinematically redundant space-based manipulators. It is proposed {{to break down the}} task of controlling the motion of a redundant manipulator into a sequence of manageable sub-tasks of lower dimension by imposing constraints on the motion of <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> of the manipulator. This implies that the manipulator then becomes a non-redundant kinematic chain and the operator only controls a reduced number of degrees of freedom at any time. However, by appropriately changing the imposed constraints, the operator can use the full capability of the manipulator throughout the task. Also, by not restricting the point of teleoperation to the end effector but effectively allowing direct control of <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> of the robot, it is possible to teleoperate a redundant robot of arbitrary kinematic architecture over its entire configuration space in a predictable and natural fashion. It is rigourously proven that this approach will always work for any kinematically redundant serial manipulator regardless of its topology, geometry and of the number of its excess degrees-of-freedom. Furthermore, a methodology is provided for the selection of task and constraint coordinates to ensure the absence of algorithmic rank-deficiencies. Two novel algorithms are provided for the symbolic determination of the rank-deficiency locus of rectangular Jacobian matrices: the Singular Vector Algorithm and the Recursive Sub-Determinant Algorithm. These algorithms are complementary to each other: the former being more computationally efficient and the latter more robust. The application of the methodology to sample cases of varying complexity has demonstrated its power and limitations: It {{has been shown to be}} powerful enough to generate complete sets of task/constraint coordinate pairs for realistic examples such as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System and a simplified version of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} algorithm for {{simulation of}} the three-dimensional nonlinear hydrodynamic {{behavior of a}} cable/lumped-body system is developed based on a direct integration method with suppression of extraneous erroneous solution. The governing equations of the cable continuum with dependent variables of cable velocities, direction cosines and tension magnitude are derived from the dynamic equilibrium conditions and kinematic compatibility conditions. The equations of motion of boundary and <b>intermediate</b> <b>bodies</b> are treated as boundary conditions and internal boundary conditions,respectively. The nonlinear combined initial-value and boundary-value problem is then solved in the time-domain by introducing a stable Newmark-like implicit integration scheme in time. This transforms the problem into a nonlinear quasi-static two-point boundary-value problem. The spatial integration algorithm is a semi-analytical method. The boundary-value problem, posed {{as a set of}} nonlinear partial differential equations, is first transformed into an iterative set of quasi-linearized boundary-value problem.
