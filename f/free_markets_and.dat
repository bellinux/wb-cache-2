5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side tax cuts and along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 and 1921, local {{opposition}} to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed. Among {{the most significant}} was the Tambov Rebellion, which was put down by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law {{in the city and}} sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the Kronstadt rebellion began when sailors in Kronstadt revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> not be subject to requisitioning. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army put down the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> {{believed that they}} could be detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own decisions}} and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E

25|$|Steele won the Republican {{nomination}} after facing little {{opposition in}} the primary. His opponents were Democrat Ben Cardin and Independent Kevin Zeese (who was endorsed by the Green and Libertarian parties). The three candidates participated in three debates.

25|$|However, {{although}} Mill' initial economic philosophy supported <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> {{argued that}} progressive taxation penalised {{those who worked}} harder, he later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes, including the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticised {{the rigid}} and determinist view {{of popular culture}} {{deployed}} within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that EC Comics often did contain such cultural critiques. Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the libertarian Cato Institute focused on the claim that culture has grown more sophisticated and diverse {{as a consequence of}} <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.|$|E
25|$|Thatcher's {{political}} and economic philosophy emphasised <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurialism. Since gaining power, she had experimented in selling off a small nationalised company, the National Freight Company, to its workers, with a surprisingly large response. After the 1983 election, the Government became bolder and sold off most of the large utilities which had been in public ownership since the late 1940s. Many in the public took advantage of share offers, although many sold their shares immediately for a quick profit. The policy of privatisation, while anathema to many on the left, has become synonymous with Thatcherism.|$|E

25|$|Hanson is {{the author}} of the 2001 book Carnage and Culture (Doubleday), {{published}} in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries as Why the West Has Won, in which he argued that the military dominance of Western civilization, beginning with the ancient Greeks, results from certain fundamental aspects of Western culture, such as consensual government, a tradition of self-critique, secular rationalism, religious tolerance, individual freedom, free expression, <b>free</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>and</b> individualism. Hanson's emphasis on cultural exception rejects racial explanations for Western military preeminence and disagrees as well with environmental or geographical determinist explanations such as those put forth by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997).|$|E
25|$|During {{its first}} five years of {{independence}} Bangladesh adopted socialist policies, an Awami League blunder. The subsequent military regime and BNP and Jatiya Party governments restored <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> promoted the country's private sector. In 1991, finance minister Saifur Rahman introduced a programme of economic liberalization. The Bangladeshi private sector has rapidly expanded, with a number of conglomerates driving the economy. Major industries include textiles, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding, steel, electronics, energy, construction materials, chemicals, ceramics, food processing and leather goods. Export-oriented industrialization has increased, with fiscal year 2014–15 exports of $30 billion. Most export earnings are from the garment-manufacturing industry. Bangladesh also has social enterprises, including the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Grameen Bank and BRAC (the world's largest non-governmental organisation).|$|E
25|$|His {{father had}} been a {{delegate}} to the Wheeling Convention, which had created the state of West Virginia, but he had also opposed the abolitionists, Radical Republicans, and opposed ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment. Davis acquired much of his father’s southern Democratic politics, opposing women’s suffrage, Federal child-labor laws and anti-lynching legislation, Harry S. Truman’s civil rights program, and defended the State’s rights to establish the poll tax by questioning whether uneducated non-taxpayers should be allowed to vote. Additionally, as much as he was opposed to centralism in politics he was opposed to concentration of capitalism by supporting a number of early progressive laws regulating Interstate commerce and limiting the power and concentration of corporations. Consequently, he felt distinctly out of place in the Republican Party, who supported free-association and <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> <b>and</b> maintained his father’s staunch allegiance to the Democratic Party, even as he later represented the interests of business opposed to the New Deal. Davis ranked as one of the last Jeffersonians, as he supported states’ rights and opposed a strong executive (he would be the lead attorney against Truman’s nationalization of the steel industry).|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and {{financial}} backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded {{the free market}} advocacy group Empower America, which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works.

He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.|$|E
