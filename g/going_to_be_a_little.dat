Edmund matured during {{the events of}} The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, so the writers saw him [...] "as our Han Solo", [...] " [...] the right thing" [...] and [...] "probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> low-key about it", highlighting the immaturity of his older brother. Keynes bruised his heel when performing a stunt where he jumped onto a horse. He narrowly missed landing on it and hit his foot against a column when holding on. Excepting that, he enjoyed performing the action.|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Much Dead Already" [...] {{was written}} by Scott M. Gimple and {{directed}} by Michelle MacLaren. It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' room we were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I think people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shocked." ...|$|E
500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I will tell you this... we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

500|$|Mauboy {{performed}} at the ICC Cricket World Cup opening ceremony held on 12 February 2015 at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne. On 3 May 2015, she appeared on the US Today show in a segment that was filmed live at the Sydney Opera House with host Savannah Guthrie. In {{an interview with the}} Australian Associated Press that same month, Mauboy revealed that she had already begun writing songs for her upcoming fourth studio album. She said, [...] "This time around with the album I would like to...just take risks in terms of the sound and identifying who I am as a woman. It's more of a rhythmic pop so it's not going to be extreme pop. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more soul." [...] The album's lead single [...] "This Ain't Love" [...] was released in September 2015; it peaked at number five and was certified gold. Mauboy along with The Veronicas and Tina Arena performed Arena's 1994 single [...] "Chains" [...] at the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, where Arena was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Their version was released as a single following the performance, and peaked at number 14.|$|E
500|$|The show {{begins with}} Beyoncé taking the stage stating [...] "This is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different, y'all. It'll be more intimate" [...] before she begins {{revealing}} multiple stories from her musical history including before—auditions with Destiny's Child starting at age nine, her father's early and frequent involvement managing his daughter's career and getting dropped by Elektra. After delving into her musical history, Beyoncé states [...] "I {{just want to}} have a good time with y'all" [...] before she begins the concert with her rendition of Michael Jackson's [...] "I Wanna Be Where You Are". Following her rendition of [...] "I Wanna Be Where You Are", Beyoncé begins a medley of past Destiny's Child songs, stopping each track to discuss her life and mindset during each stage of her career. During her performance of [...] "Independent Women" [...] she reveals how her father, Mathew Knowles, submitted the track to the Charlie's Angels (2000) soundtrack without permission, reveals that she wants to write a song [...] "that celebrates a woman's curves" [...] inspired by Stevie Nicks' guitar riff in [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] (1982) for [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and states [...] "With a lot of success comes a lot of negativity...they were being nasty but it inspired me" [...] before performing [...] "Survivor".|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt {{the best way to do}} this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E

2500|$|On March 24, 2015, {{during an}} {{interview}} in Paraguay, Foster The People announced that {{they were working on}} a third album. When describing their upcoming record, they said that [...] "the first record was more, kind of, electro-pop, the second record was more of a rock record, and I think this one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more hip hop".|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's {{going on in the world}} and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
