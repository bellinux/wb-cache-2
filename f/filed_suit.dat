5|$|Taft's ruling had {{no bearing}} on the cases of Governor Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall except to spell out a means {{for them to take}} their cases to the federal courts, if necessary. On the same day that Taft's ruling was issued, Taylor <b>filed</b> <b>suit</b> in Jefferson County circuit court against Beckham and Adjutant General John Breckinridge Castleman to prevent them from exercising any {{authority}} due the offices they claimed. Unaware of Taylor's suit, Beckham <b>filed</b> <b>suit</b> against Taylor for possession of the capitol and executive building in Franklin County circuit court – a court believed to be favorable to the Democratic cause. Marshall also <b>filed</b> <b>suit</b> against Beckham and state senator L. H. Carter to prevent them from exercising any authority in the state senate, where the lieutenant governor was the presiding officer.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court has}} {{concurrent}} jurisdiction involving {{contracts with the}} federal government, where a contractor has the option of choosing between <b>filing</b> <b>suit</b> with the court or with the agency Board of Contract Appeals. The general rule is that a contractor may either 1) <b>file</b> <b>suit</b> within 90 days with the agency Board of Contract Appeals or 2) <b>file</b> <b>suit</b> within one year with the court. A contractor, however, must choose which forum in which to file; a contractor cannot <b>file</b> <b>suit</b> with both the agency Board and with the court. (However, in a case where a contractor has filed with the Board, and the Government challenges the timeliness of the filing — the 90-day limit is statutory and cannot be extended — the contractor can file with the court within the one-year period to protect its claims.) ...|$|R

5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the project schedule and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's project management and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons <b>filed</b> <b>suit</b> on February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements and circumstances beyond their control. Caltrain <b>filed</b> <b>suit</b> a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E

Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.|$|E
