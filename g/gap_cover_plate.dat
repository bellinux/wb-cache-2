40|$|AbstractThree {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} model was utilized to determine mode I stress intensity factor through {{the front of a}} single edge crack in main <b>plate</b> with welded <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The numerical results showed that the ratio of the crack length to the position of the welded <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end is a crucial parameter for describing the efficiency of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> location. When the crack tip just reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> efficiency is only dependent on the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> dimensions regardless the location of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> or the crack length. In the case of crack front not reached the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> end, the location of <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> {{near the edge of the}} main plate, i. e., near the crack mouth, is less efficient than that faraway. However, the opposite trend was found for cracks pass beneath the <b>cover</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
50|$|The MAE {{consisted}} of a small gallium-arsenide solar cell mounted underneath a removable glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> As the mission progressed, atmospheric dust would settle on the glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate,</b> blocking increasingly more sunlight from striking the solar cell, causing it to produce less power. Throughout the mission, the glass <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was occasionally rotated away from the solar cell, removing the light-blocking effects of the dust. Sensors measuring the difference in power output of the solar cell {{before and after the}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was removed indicated how quickly the solar cell was losing its ability to produce power, and by extension, how quickly dust was collecting on the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R

30|$|Before bonding a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to 3 D molded substrate, holes were {{drilled in}} the inlet and outlet {{area of the}} 3 D channel. A solvent-assisted bonding {{technique}} developed by Brown et al. [27] for bonding of PMMA chips was used. A few drops of a solvent mixture (47.5 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 47.5 % water and 5 % methanol) were spread over the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and then the 3 D molded substrate was placed in conformal contact with the <b>cover</b> <b>plate.</b> The assembly of 3 D molded substrate/cover plate was loaded in the NIL machine and brought to 92  °C and a 10  bar for 30  min, which led to complete bonding. For micromixers with no side and three sides of microchannel walls patterned, a plain <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> without any patterns was used while, for micromixers with one side and four sides of channel walls patterned, a <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> patterned with ratchet gratings was used. For the micromixer with four sides patterned, the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> was so aligned for bonding that the ratchet gratings in the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> were in parallel with the ratchet gratings {{in the bottom of}} the 3 D microchannel.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} core density and <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> {{thickness}} on the blast response of sacrificial cladding panels {{has been investigated}} through blast loading experiments and finite element modelling on structures with steel <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> and aluminium foam cores. A range of foam core densities were examined, with 10 %, 15 % and 20 % nominal relative densities. The <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> thickness greatly influenced {{the response of the}} sacrificial cladding. <b>Cover</b> <b>plates</b> that were 2 mm thick exhibited significant permanent deformations and variable percentage crush across the section, whereas the 4 mm thick <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> were more rigid causing the core to compress uniformly. Considerable fracture of the foam was observed after blast testing, particularly for the lower density foams. The effect of bonding the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to the core was also examined. Numerical simulations of the experiments were performed using ABAQUS/Explicit to provide insight into the response mechanism. It was shown through the finite element simulations that tensile fracture of the foam occurred during the unloading phase of response and that adhesion of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> to the foam caused higher levels of cracking. This was consistent with the experimental observations...|$|R

These openings are then covered with appropriate <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> bolted with the stay plate. The stay <b>plate</b> along with <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> will be seeing thermal transients during reactor scrams. The thermal transient will cause the membrane stress due to global temperature increase in <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> and bending stress due to temperature gradient across the thickness.

40|$|Shear stress {{intensity}} factors are calculated for three problems concerning inextensible <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> either bonded to or embedded in an elastic sheet which is under uniaxial tension. The {{stress intensity}} factors are small when {{the ratio of}} sheet thickness to <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> length is small and, as the ratio increase, rapidly approach their asymptotic values for infinite sheet thickness. In {{the problem of the}} embedded <b>cover</b> <b>plate,</b> the stress intensity factor also depends on the Poisson's ratio of the sheet material. The dependence on Poisson's ratio, however, is significant only when the ratio of sheet thickness to <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> length is small.

This thesis investigates {{the use of}} partial-length steel <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> about column mid-height to improve the weak-axis buckling resistance. The present research first reviews literature concerning the Euler buckling of members with partial-length reinforcement. Inelastic buckling is simulated by 3 -D finite element analysis accounting for <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> length, <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> area, bolt hole perforations, yield stresses, residual and locked-in dead load stresses, and initial out-of-straightness.

The proposed joint includes two diaphragm plates welded {{to the outer}} circumference of the column and bolted to the beam flanges with two tapered <b>cover</b> <b>plates.</b> The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> were integrated in the connection to act as replaceable links after seismic actions. A series of full-scale laboratory experiments of the joint was conducted to investigate its energy dissipation and hysteretic response. The <b>cover</b> <b>plates</b> used in the experimental work had the same geometry but differed from each other on steel grade, bolt-holes size, use of stiffeners and bolts’ preloading force.

40|$|When a {{horizontal}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is placed above a cavity, the mechanism leading to enhanced self-sustained oscillation within the cavity is investigated by experiment at a Reynolds number Re-theta o = 171 +/- 5. As {{the leading edge}} of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is located right above the most sensitive region of the cavity shear layer, the oscillating amplitude of shear layer instability is enhanced most effectively. However, this effectiveness decreases when {{the leading edge of}} the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> moves further downstream of the cavity. Three mechanisms are found to possibly modify the shear layer instability across the cavity. First of all, insertion of {{a horizontal}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> above the cavity does impose a favourable streamwise pressure gradient that accelerates the flow across the cavity. This flow acceleration increases the amplification rate of shear layer instability. Second, the boundary layer characteristics (both the frequency band and the fluctuating amplitude) may also provide another opportunity to perturb the shear layer instability. Third, the shear layer is deflected into the cavity and leads to strong feedback. In the present study, all three mechanisms are equally important when {{the leading edge of the}} <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned above the cavity mouth. However, when the leading edge of the <b>cover</b> <b>plate</b> is located downstream of the cavity, the first and the second effects diminish. In this situation, the stronger feedback due to the inward-deflected shear layer (the third effect) plays an important role to modify the shear layer instability. (C) 2000 Academic Press...|$|R
