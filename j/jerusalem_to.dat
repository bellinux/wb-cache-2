5|$|The Battles of Latrun were {{a series}} of {{military}} engagements between the Israel Defense Forces and the Jordanian Arab Legion {{on the outskirts of}} Latrun between 25 May and 18 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Latrun takes its name from the monastery close to the junction of two major highways: <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> Jaffa/Tel Aviv and Gaza to Ramallah. During the British Mandate it became a Palestine Police base with a Tegart fort. The United Nations Resolution 181 placed this area within the proposed Arab state. In May 1948, it was {{under the control of the}} Arab Legion. It commanded the only road linking the Yishuv-controlled area of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> Israel, giving Latrun strategic importance in the battle for Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to come all the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> accept the surrender of the city.|$|E
5|$|Amalric of Jerusalem {{entrusted}} {{the government}} of the Kingdom of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> Bohemond before departing for his campaign against Egypt in July 1164. Taking advantage of Bohemond's absence, Nur ad-Din attacked the fortress at Harenc in the Principality of Antioch (present-day Harem, Syria). Bohemond, RaymondIII of Tripoli, ThorosII of Armenian Cilicia, and Constantine Kalamanos joined their forces and marched to Harenc, compelling Nur ad-Din to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older Politicians, was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E

5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem had a single Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>to</b> observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E
5|$|At the Hospitallers' request, Pope Gregory IX {{repeated}} the excommunication of Bohemond in March 1230.

With the mediation of Gerald and the Ibelins, Bohemond and the Hospitallers made a treaty which was signed on 26 October 1231. Bohemond confirmed the Hospitallers' right to hold Jabala and a nearby fortress and granted them money fiefs in both Tripoli and Antioch. The knights renounced the privileges that Raymond-Roupen had granted to them. Before long, Gerald of Lausanne lifted the excommunication and sent the treaty to Rome to be confirmed by the Holy See.|$|E
