2500|$|In August 2010, Schmidt {{clarified}} his company's {{views on}} network neutrality: [...] "I {{want to be}} clear {{what we mean by}} Net neutrality: What we mean is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> data type like video, you don't discriminate against one person's video in favor of another. But it's okay to discriminate across different types. So you could prioritize voice over video. And there is general agreement with Verizon and Google on that issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{the book}} was revived during the 1999 lawsuit between Nancy Stouffer and J.K. Rowling over the {{creation}} of the name [...] "Muggles". An article in the Lawrence Journal-World on June 14, 2000, said Kendall had used the name about 30 years before Stouffer and Rowling. Kendall found the incident amusing and was not ill-disposed towards either author. Speaking about the copying, she said, [...] "I've got no quarrel with them...There's only so many ideas and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> then someone else out there probably has the same one, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I DO {{want to see}} my mother--and <b>you</b> would, too, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one.</b> I ain't {{any more}} baby than you are." [...] And Joe snuffled a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wheel {{yourself}} to the table, lazy boy: no seat will serve <b>you</b> but mine; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> spark {{of a sense of}} propriety, you would always leave that chair for the Old Lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|Esmond laughed, {{as though}} he had partly {{expected}} this. [...] "There are no doubt more of you behind there. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> I would prefer to talk to your recognized leader." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not your legal opinion," [...] she replied, smiling, [...] "but {{your opinion}} as a citizen, as an individual, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one.</b> To be frank, I want {{your opinion of}} me. Do {{you happen to have}} such a thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Edward, this is {{just one}} of your {{wholesale}} declarations, for nothing only to get me into a dispute with you, you know," [...] replied the lady. [...] "On your conscience, now, (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,)</b> is it not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BIGELOW--[Coldly.] Do {{you realize}} how contemptible this {{confession}} makes you out? [Angrily.] Why, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> trace of human kindness in you--one bit of unselfish love for your wife--one particle of pity for her suffering-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a puzzle," [...] {{the giant}} responded, thoughtfully. [...] "I {{do not see}} how you could ride on a bicycle even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one,</b> and <b>you</b> {{certainly}} can not walk far in your present condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho, coward!" [...] said ALUM, [...] "with {{heart of}} a child! Thou son of a party whose grave is defiled! Is ALUM in terror? is ALUM afeard? Ho! ho! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> I'd laugh at your beard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I admire you for it, old boy. I don't believe I {{should have}} done it at your age--too much of a Forsyte, I'm afraid. But I suppose the type gets thinner with each generation. Your son, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> may be a pure altruist; who knows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{neither a}} thief nor a tramp," [...] Vincent said; [...] "and I {{do not want}} anything, except that I should be glad to buy {{a loaf of bread}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> that you could spare. I have lost my way, and I want to ask directions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's mine," [...] said The Oskaloosa Kid, [...] "and I want to {{buy some}} eggs and milk and ham and bacon and flour and onions and sugar and cream and {{strawberries}} and tea and coffee and a frying pan and a little oil stove, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> to spare, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't like {{to carry}} insane bugs, lame toads, and convulsive kittens in your hands, {{and they would}} not stay on a {{stretcher}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one.</b> <b>You</b> should <b>have</b> an ambulance and be a branch of the Sanitary Commission," [...] said Will.|$|R

6000|$|... "You are a {{fine young}} fellow, Whitney; and your mother, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> {{ought to be}} proud of you. I should be, if you were a son of mine. It was a lucky day for us all, when I shipped you on board the Paramatta; for {{it would have been a}} heavy day for us, if those two young ladies had been killed by that madman, yesterday.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder why}} you chappies call {{this sort of}} thing 'sitting,'" [...] said Archie, pensively, as he {{conducted}} tentative experiments in osteopathy on his aching back. [...] "I say, old thing, I could do with a restorative, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> handy. But, of course, you haven't, I suppose," [...] he added, resignedly. Abstemious as a rule, there were moments when Archie found the Eighteenth Amendment somewhat trying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Land, white lords, land," [...] said Komba {{with the}} utmost politeness, [...] "and go, visit the god who doubtless is waiting for you. And now, as we shall meet no more--farewell. You are wise and I am foolish, yet hearken to my counsel. If ever you should return to the Earth again, be advised by me. Cling to your own god <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> and do not meddle {{with those of other}} peoples. Again farewell." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Peter," [...] said he, [...] "you look so sober, that I thought <b>you</b> really <b>had</b> {{something}} to worry about. What {{would you do}} with a big tail, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one?</b> It would always be in your way. Just think how many times Reddy Fox or old Granny Fox <b>have</b> almost caught <b>you.</b> They certainly would <b>have</b> before this, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had a long tail sticking out behind for them to get hold of. I had a long tail when I was young, and I was mighty glad to get rid of it." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{heard of}} a horse running away with a man, and dashing him down, dead, {{at the corner of}} a street. Pursuing the horse with {{incredible}} speed, was another man, who ran so fast, that he came up, immediately after the accident. He threw himself upon his knees beside the unfortunate rider, and clasped his hand with an expression of the wildest grief. 'If you have life,' he said, 'speak one word to me! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> gasp of breath left, mention your age for Heaven's sake, that I may play that number in the lottery.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please find {{herewith}} {{a contract}} in duplicate {{for your next}} book which we have taken the liberty of forwarding to you. You will please note that we have increased your royalties to twenty per cent, which is about {{as high as a}} conservative publishing house dares go. If our offer is agreeable to you, please fill in the proper blank space with the title of your book. We make no stipulations concerning its nature. Any book on any subject. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> already written, so much the better. Now is the time to strike. The iron could not be hotter." ...|$|E

Supposing {{then that}} {{you are ready to}} take a certain amount of pains, and to bear a little irksomeness and a few disappointments bravely, I can promise you that an hour's {{practice}} a day for six months, or an hour's practice every other day for twelve months, or, disposed in whatever way you find convenient, some hundred and fifty hours' practice, will give you sufficient power of drawing faithfully whatever you want to draw, and a good judgment, up to a certain point, of other people's work: of which hours <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> to spare at present, we may as well begin at once.|$|E

5000|$|For One More Day {{is about}} a son who gets to spend a day with his mother who died eight years earlier. Charley “Chick” Benetto is a retired {{baseball}} player who, facing the pain of unrealized dreams, alcoholism, divorce, and an estrangement from his grown daughter, returns to his childhood home and attempts suicide. There he meets his long dead mother, who welcomes him as if nothing ever happened. The book explores the question, “What would <b>you</b> do <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> more day with someone you’ve lost?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Beauty, you {{are only}} {{just in time to}} save his life. See what happens when people do not keep their promises! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> delayed <b>one</b> day more, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> found him dead." ...|$|R
60|$|More {{and more}} I incline {{to the former}} possibility. He has learned unconsciously the {{strength}} of lying still. A thousand generations of fat and healthy porcupines have taught him the folly of trouble and rush and worry {{in a world that}} somebody else has planned, and for which somebody else is plainly responsible. So he makes no effort and lives in profound peace. But this also leaves you with a question which may take you overseas to explore Hindu philosophy. Indeed, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one</b> question when you meet Unk Wunk for the first time, you will have twenty after you have studied him for a season or two. His paragraph in the woods' journal begins and ends with a question mark, and a dash for what is left unsaid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chief, will it not {{be enough}} if I die? I am old, and my life does not matter. Or if one is not sufficient, take me and my son, and let the lad, my grandson, go free. We are all of us {{innocent}} of any witchcraft, {{and he is not}} even old enough to practise such things, being but an unmarried boy. Chief, you, also, are young. Would not your heart be heavy if you had to be slain when the sun of your life was still new in the sky? Think, White Chief, what your father would feel, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> should he be forced to see you killed before his eyes, that some stranger might use your body to show his skill with a magic weapon by slaying the wild things that would eat it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, true," [...] he said, wincing a little. [...] "I did {{not come}} to reproach you for my deeds. I came Tess, to say that I don't like you to be working like this, and I have come on purpose for you. You say you have a husband who is not I. Well, perhaps you have; but I've never seen him, and you've not told me his name; and {{altogether}} he seems rather a mythological personage. However, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>one,</b> I think I am nearer to you than he is. I, at any rate, try to help you out of trouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face! The words of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me. Don't you know them, Tess?--'And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not overtake him; and she shall seek him, but shall not find him; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now!' ... Tess, my trap is waiting just under the hill, and--darling mine, not his!--you know the rest." ...|$|E
