The information downloaded from these devices confirmed what the crew had already told the investigators, that the engines had not responded when the throttles were advanced during final approach.Recorded data indicates that an adequate fuel quantity was on board the aircraft and that the autothrottle and engine control commands were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust.All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines to throttle lever inputs are being examined, in close co-operation with Boeing, Rolls Royce and British Airways.

50|$|The {{fuel-air}} mixture {{can only}} burn in slow-moving air, so {{an area of}} reverse flow is maintained by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> for the approximately stoichiometric burning in the primary zone.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{characteristics of}} a cyclone jet hybrid combustor {{using a combination of}} swirling premixed and jet diffusion flames were experimentally investigated to achieve high flame stability and low pollutant emissions. Two kinds of combustion modes were examined: the diffusion combustion (DC) mode, which consists of swirling air flow and jet diffusion flame, and the hybrid combustion (HC) mode, which consists of swirling premixed and jet diffusion flames. In the HC mode, the effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry on fuel-air mixing were investigated in terms of flame stability and pollutant emissions. The results showed that the HC mode can significantly reduce soot, CO, and NOx emissions in a stable flame region compared to the DC mode. However, CO emission in the HC mode increases drastically when overall equivalence ratios drop below 0. 75. By modifying the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> for the jet diffusion flame, it was found that increases in fuel-air mixing using the improved nozzle provide a stable flame region approximately twice as wide as that of the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> using a single hole.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} {{aspects of the}} liquid fuel placement in a swirl cup were investigated experimentally at elevated pressure. The operating parameter whose effect was investigated was air pressure. Air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) and relative pressure drop were held constant during variations of air pressure. Geometry parameters investigated included swirl angle, <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> axial position and <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> flow number. Measurement techniques included Mie-scattering laser light sheets for spray visualization, PDA for a detailed spay analysis and LDA for investigation of the air flow field {{in the absence of}} the spray. The test swirl cup geometry consisted of axial segments, so that cross-sectional planes in the interior of the swirl cup were accessible for light sheet imaging and LDA measurements. PDA measurements were conducted downstream of the swirl cup exit plane. Operating conditions realized for PDA measurements were 6, 12 and 18 bar at 700 K. Light sheet imaging and LDA measurements were performed at scaled operating conditions. It was found that the fuel placement is governed overwhelmingly by the airflow swirl angle. The two-phase flow in the swirl cup depends heavily on whether or not there is a recirculation zone within the swirl cup or not. In the absence of a recirculation zone, the radially inward airflow at the upstream end of the swirl cup causes the spray cone generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> to collapse. Subsequent transfer of tangential momentum to the fuel droplets then leads to a re-opening of the spray cone by swirl-induced centrifugal forces. If there is a recirculation zone present within the swirl cup, then the spray generated by the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> is injected into a region of upstream and radially outward flow. This causes some fuel to be present outside of the nominal cone angle of the pressure swirl <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> and ensures that virtually all of the liquid fuel is placed onto the filmer...|$|R

50|$|Maintenance was {{performed}} on the engines by opening panels in {{the leading edge of the}} wing either side of the powerplant. A plank could be fitted across the front of the engine on the extensions of the open panels. A small manually started auxiliary petrol engine, which was fitted into the leading edge of the right wing, powered a bilge and a fuel pump for clearing water and other fluids from the fuselage bilges and for refuelling. Generally, the aircraft were reasonably water tight, and two people manually operating a wobble pump could transfer fuel faster than the auxiliary pump. In sheltered moorings or at sea, fuelling was accomplished by a powered or unpowered barge and with engine driven or hand powered pumps. At regular moorings, there would be specially designed refuelling barges to do the job, normally manned by trained marine crew. These vessels could refuel many aircraft during the course of the day.

40|$|In this study, the {{stability}} and the light emittance of non-premixed propane-oxygen flames have been experimentally evaluated with respect to swirling oxidizer flow and variations in <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter.

The investigation into the flame phenomenology was comprised of variations of the oxidizer and fuel flow velocities (respective Reynolds numbers) and the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter.

50|$|The {{thrust chamber}} {{injector}} received the propellants {{under pressure from}} the turbopumps, then mixed them in a manner that produced the most efficient combustion. 614 hollow oxidizer posts were machined to form {{an integral part of the}} injector, with <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> (each swaged to the face of the injector) threaded through and installed over the oxidizer posts in concentric rings. The injector face was porous, being formed from layers of stainless steel wire mesh, and was welded at its periphery to the injector body. The injector received LOX through the dome manifold and injected it through the oxidizer posts into the combustion area of the thrust chamber, while fuel was received from the upper fuel manifold in the thrust chamber and injected through the fuel orifices which were concentric with the oxidizer orifices. The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the thrust chamber. The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel is {{injected}} by a constant flow injection system. There is an engine driven mechanical fuel pump and about 42 <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The pump can flow 100 usgal L per minute at 7500 rpm and [...] fuel pressure. In general 10 injectors {{are placed in}} the injector hat above the supercharger, 16 in the intake manifold and two per cylinder in the cylinder head. Usually a race is started with a leaner mixture, then as the clutch begins to tighten as the engine speed builds, the air/fuel mixture is enriched. As the increased engine speed builds up pump pressure, the mixture is made leaner to maintain a predetermined ratio {{that is based on}} many factors, especially race track surface friction. The stoichiometry of both methanol and nitromethane is considerably greater than that of racing gasoline, as they have oxygen atoms attached to their carbon chains and gasoline does not. This means that a [...] "fueler" [...] engine will provide power over a very broad range from very lean to very rich mixtures. Thus, to attain maximum performance, before each race, by varying the level of fuel supplied to the engine, the mechanical crew may select power outputs barely below the limits of tire traction.

In this study, nozzle diameter is kept constant, while the angles of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> are varied. Three kinds of combustors having fuel nozzle angles of 30 ゜, 45 ゜and 60 ゜are used. For each combustor, deviation angle between air and <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> is set to be 0 ゜, 15 ゜and 45 ゜, respectively.
