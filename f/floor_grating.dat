50|$|The Carley float {{was formed}} from {{a length of}} copper or steel tubing 12-20 inches (30-50 cm) in {{diameter}} bent into an oval ring. The ring {{was surrounded by a}} buoyant mass of kapok or cork, and then covered with a layer of canvas rendered waterproof via painting or doping. The metal tube was divided into waterproof compartments with vertical baffles. The raft was thus rigid, and could remain buoyant, floating equally well with either side uppermost, even if the waterproof outer was punctured. The floor of the raft was made from a wood or webbing grating. Boxes containing paddles, water, rations and survival equipment were lashed to the <b>floor</b> <b>grating.</b> Men could either sit around the rim of the raft, or, if in the water, cling to rope loops strung around its edge. The largest model could accommodate up to fifty men, half inside the raft, and the others in the water holding onto the ropes.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across bodies wearing strange metal {{helmets and}} soon find {{an army of}} them and Daleks rising from the River Thames. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with {{captured}} resistance members including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into Robomen. Ian doesn't understand why the Daleks still exist since the travelers defeated them on Skaro (in The Daleks) but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed. David and Susan are able to rescue the Doctor, still drugged, while Barbara gets separated from them {{and is able to}} return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape the saucer; he and Larry hide beneath a <b>floor</b> <b>grating</b> as the Daleks and saucer leave for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.|$|E
40|$|A 1400 lb {{blower fan}} and a 2700 lb filter box {{are to be}} {{supported}} at Lab 3. The support structure is a framework that suspends from the building wall to the cleanroom and to a washroom. The framework is made of welded 4 -inch x 8 -inch x 1 / 4 -inch rectangular A 36 steel tube. Welds are to be standard prequalified welds as by AISC. The main support frame is approximately 7 -feet {{off the floor and}} welded onto the top of 10 columns. A deflection and stress study was performed on the planned structure. A scaled plan view is given in drawing 3823. 113 -MD- 358764. The heaviest loaded beams were labeled with a letter designation and were studied for beam deflections and stresses.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a floor gully come with grating to prevent the oviposition of Aedes aegypti in the floor trap. In order to conduct the test, two containers were placed into a mosquito cage (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm). Both containers were filled with declorinated seasoned tap water and covered with <b>floor</b> gully c/w <b>grating</b> and normal <b>floor</b> gully, respectively. A total of 50 gravid Ae. aegypti females were then released into the cage and left for a week. All the eggs obtained from the test were allowed to remain inside the containers for the eggs to hatch. The number of hatched larvae was counted and recorded. Five replicates were conducted concurrently. There was a significant difference of Ae. aegypti larvae obtained between container with <b>floor</b> gully c/w <b>grating</b> and normal <b>floor</b> gully (p < 0. 05). A total of 96. 41 % reduction of Ae. aegypti larvae was obtained in the container with <b>floor</b> gully c/w <b>grating</b> compared with the normal floor gully, indicating that the <b>floor</b> gully c/w <b>grating</b> used in this study was able to prevent oviposition of Ae. aegypti in holding water...|$|R
40|$|Conclusion In {{nearly three}} years of {{continuous}} oceanographic measure-ments, comprehensive, valuable data sets have been obtained at the FINO 1 offshore platform. On {{the basis of these}} data, it has been possible to gain an overall impression of the physical power of waves and currents, {{as well as of the}} high variability of ocean dynamics in this sea area. The measurement data also provide information about the oceanographic boundary condi-tions for the construction of offshore wind turbines in the German Bight. However, model data have shown the high spatial variability of ocean physics in the North Sea, which leads to the recommendation to measure the local basic environmental vari-ables wherever larger areas of wind farms are planned to be established.

40|$|This {{report is}} to present the {{progress}} made on the project entitled ''Establishment of an Environmental Control Technology Laboratory (ECTL) with a Circulating Fluidized-Bed Combustion (CFBC) System'' during the period July 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006. The following activities have been completed: the steel <b>floor</b> <b>grating</b> around the riser in all levels and the three-phase power supply for CFBC System was installed. Erection of downcomers, loop seals, ash bunker, thermal expansion joints, fuel and bed material bunkers with load cells, rotary air-lock valves and fuel flow monitors is underway. Pilot-scale slipstream tests conducted with bromine compound addition were performed for two typical types of coal. The purposes of the tests were to study the effect of bromine addition on mercury oxidization. From the test results, {{it was observed that}} there was a strong oxidization effect for Powder River Basin (PRB) coal.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of special {{features}} that may be used to ornament a floor or perform a useful service. Examples include Floor medallions which provide a decorative centerpiece of a <b>floor</b> design, or <b>Gratings</b> used to drain water or to rub dirt off shoes.|$|R
40|$|Both well-designed {{equipment}} and trained employees {{are required to}} maintain a high standard of animal welfare during slaughter. When McDonald's Corporation started auditing U. S. beef and pork slaughter plants in 1999, there were great improvements in handling and stunning. They used a numerical objective scoring system. It contained five basic measurements: (1) the percentage of animals stunned on the first attempt, (2) percentage rendered insensible prior to hoisting, (3) percentage vocalizing during handling and stunning. (4) percentage that fall down and (5) percentage moved with an electric goad. Each variable was scored on a simple yes/no basis. Baseline data was collected prior to the McDonald's audits in 1996. The most striking improvements were in beef. The average effective first shot stunning score was 89. 5 % in 1996, 96. 2 % in 1999 and 98. 6 % 5 years later in 2003. The average percentage of cattle vocalizing during stunning and handling was 8 % in 1996, 2. 4 % in 1999 and 2. 0 % in 2003. A total of 50 plants were audited. Most plants were able to greatly improve welfare by improving stunner maintenance; installing non-slip <b>floor</b> <b>gratings</b> in stun boxes and better training. They also had to make simple, low cost changes to eliminate distractions that cause animals to balk and refuse to move. The most common ways to improve animal movement were: (1) install a lamp on a dark race entrance, (2) move ceiling lamps to eliminate sparkling reflections, (3) muffle air hissing, (4) install shields and solid sides on races to prevent animals from seeing moving people up ahead and (5) eliminate air drafts that blow {{in the faces of}} approaching animals. A major remaining problem area is in plants that are not in a program of yearly audits by restaurants. Serious animal abuse has occurred in some of these non-audited plants. 1...|$|R

60|$|The wood-encased {{bulk of the}} {{low-pressure}} cylinder, frowning portly from above, {{emitted a}} faint wheeze at every thrust, and except for that low hiss the engines worked their steel limbs headlong or slow with a silent, determined smoothness. And all this, the white walls, the moving steel, the floor plates under Solomon Rout's feet, the <b>floors</b> of iron <b>grating</b> above his head, the dusk and the gleams, uprose and sank continuously, with one accord, upon the harsh wash of the waves against the ship's side. The whole loftiness of the place, booming hollow to the great voice of the wind, swayed at the top like a tree, would go over bodily, as if borne down {{this way and that}} by the tremendous blasts.|$|R
60|$|His shout {{rang out}} like the blast of a warning trumpet, between the iron walls of the engine-room. Painted white, they rose high into the dusk of the skylight, sloping like a roof; and the whole lofty space resembled the {{interior}} of a monument, divided by <b>floors</b> of iron <b>grating,</b> with lights flickering at different levels, and a mass of gloom lingering in the middle, within the columnar stir of machinery under the motionless swelling of the cylinders. A loud and wild resonance, made up of all the noises of the hurricane, dwelt in the still warmth of the air. There was in it the smell of hot metal, of oil, and a slight mist of steam. The blows of the sea seemed to traverse it in an unringing, stunning shock, from side to side.|$|R
