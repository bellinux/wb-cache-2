25|$|Mondt then {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with Philadelphia promoter, Ray Fabiani. The new combination wasted little time and found their new title holder in Dick Shickat, a former circus strongman from Germany. Once Dick Shickat's title reign had run its course, Mondt and Fabiani made Jim Londos their new champion and continued their hold on the Northeast. They soon expanded onto New York City, Hartford, Baltimore, and Washington DC. Toots/Fabiani were unsuccessful because rival New York promoter Jack Curley prevented them from promoting in NYC for years, and {{it was during this}} time that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>around</b> an up-and-coming Lou Thesz, with whom Mondt had a bad history. As Jack Curley was on his deathbed, Toots realized that New York wrestling would fall apart. So Toots & Fabiani immediately formed an alliance with fellow booking heavyweight Rudy Dusek. This formation to take over New York was kept a secret. At Curley's funeral, one of his sons approached Toots about taking over New York and was not aware that Toots had a plan. Toots also gained help from other bookers such as Jack Pfeffer, the Johnston Brothers and Jess McMahon. Jess McMahon worked for boxing promoter and New York Rangers hockey franchise founder Tex Rickard, who despised wrestling, preventing bookings in Madison Square Garden (MSG) from 1939 to 1948. Toots found former wrestler turned millionaire Bernarr McFadden, who gave Toots the financial backings.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008–09, Odom {{arrived at}} {{training}} camp out of shape. Jackson shared {{his plan to}} move Odom to the bench as their sixth man, backing up the Lakers' frontcourt of Gasol, Bynum, and Trevor Ariza. A free agent after the season, Odom initially balked at the plan to be a reserve {{for the first time}} in his career. However, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>around,</b> and was resolved to make his teammates happy and sacrifice his own individual numbers in the hopes of securing his first NBA championship. When Bynum was injured in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies in January, Odom returned to the starting lineup. In the month of February, Odom, playing 36 minutes per game, averaged 16.5 points, 13.4 rebounds (4.9 offensive and 9.5 defensive), 2.4 assists, 1.4 blocks, and [...]9 steals. The February run included a good performance at Quicken Loans Arena at Cleveland. With 15 points in the 3rd quarter, Odom helped the Lakers out of a 12-point deficit to turn it into a 10-point victory, breaking Cleveland's 23 game home win-streak. He finished the game with 28 points, 17 rebounds and 2 assists.|$|E

We did not know how to add strength together and become strong." ...|$|E

He did not belong with himself any more, for even then {{he was out of}} himself, {{standing}} with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.|$|E

Mr. Vane, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>around</b> here on Sunday, and gave him as stiff a talkin' to as he ever got, I guess.
