The infants’ tibio-femoral angle, inter-condylar, and inter-malleoli distances were measured at monthly intervals using clinical methods. Age-reference values were generated. Results showed that the developmental pattern of tibio-femoral angle is extreme varus at birth with values ranging from 5 °to 25 °.

Above a medium Mn(II) concentration of 200 microM, the intracellular Mn(II) level was independent of the medium Mn(II) and unresponsive to oxygen stresses but was reduced by phosphate limitation. At a pH of 5. 5, citrate, isocitrate, and cis-aconitate effectively promoted MN(II) uptake, although measurable levels of 1, 5 -[14 C]citrate were not accumulated.

After 43 weeks, these cats were boosted {{with the same}} proviral plasmid. Analysis of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} at several time points after the primary and booster inoculations revealed no detectable virus or proviral DNA. At 6 weeks after the booster, immunized cats and additional naive control cats were challenged with a cell-free preparation of the infectious biological isolate FIV-PPR by the intraperitoneal route. Virus was detected after challenge in unvaccinated control cats but not in any of the FIV-pPPR-Δvif-immunized cats.

Three of the six T. fusca cellulases (endoglucanase Cel 6 A and exoglucanases Cel 6 B and Cel 48 A) have been converted in previous work by replacing their cellulose-binding modules (CBMs) with a dockerin, and the resultant recombinant “cellulosomized ” enzymes were incorporated into chimeric scaffolding proteins that contained cohesin(s) together with a CBM. The activities of the resultant designer cellulosomes were compared with an equivalent mixture of wild-type enzymes.

40|$|Seismicity occurs mainly around plate boundaries, {{but there}} are rare occurrences of large {{magnitude}} earthquakes with a plate. When and why these events occur is not well understood but {{they are capable of}} producing significant damage to these regions. Where these earthquakes occur, are known as intraplate seismic zones. In the American Midwest there are two seismically active intraplate seismic zones, the New Madrid and Wabash Valley seismic zones. Each of these zones is capable of producing large magnitude earthquakes though it has proven somewhat difficult to study intraplate seismicity because the reoccurrence intervals for intraplate events are much longer than interplate earthquakes, requiring a much longer timescale for study. One approach to avoid the longer timescale of observation is to focus on studying smaller events, which occur more often. However, these events will have their own disadvantages with less optimal signal-to-noise ratios which does not allow events to be located by the minimum three seismometers needed to triangulate the events epicenter. A potential solution to remedy this difficulty is to use methods using one-station events that go beyond the conventional ways of locating earthquakes and possibly improve locating microseismic events that normally go unnoticed. A small seismograph array was set up around Cedar Lake, in Makanda, Illinois. This location is situated southwest of the Wabash Valley seismic zone and north of the New Madrid seismic zone but is typically viewed as aseismic. The conventional method was used for finding events by triangulation on three months data from January 1, 2011 to March 31, 2011. Through triangulation there 14 events located in January, 10 in February, and 74 in March. In addition to triangulated events, event probabilities for one-station also applied events and located a few of these events via azimuth by utilizing three component seismometers.

(1) When the reactive site of a photosubstrate is an alpha-carbon atom of the type CH-CO 2 -, decarboxylation is preferred over dehydrogenation, whereas {{the reverse is true}} for the neutral CH-CO 2 H.

When the substate does not contain a carboxylate group, isotope effects occur, in verification of previous reports, e. g. for benzyl alcohol C 6 H 5 -C 2 H 20 H. (3) The mechanism of flavin-sensitized substrate photodecarboxylation is assumed to consist in a primary carbanion fixation at the flavin nucleus (position 4 a, 5 or 8) with concomitant liberation of CO 2. This step is followed by rapid fragmentation of the adduct CH-Fl-red., provided that the substrate contains a functional and electron-donating group X, e. g. X = OH, OCH 3 or NH 2 (but not NH 3 + !) in X CH-CO 2 -. (4) The minimal requirement for flavin-sensitized C-H dehydrogenation is the presence of a hydroxyl group. For example, methanol as substrate and solvent is dehydrogenated at pH sufficiently alkaline for detection of the presence of the active species CH 3 O-, whereas at more acidic pH substrate dehydrogenation is competing with flavin autophotolysis, which depends on the substituents in the flavin nucleus...|$|R

Average concentrations in K, L, and BM were 0. 27, 0. 25, and 0. 13 mg/kg dw, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between Hg concentrations in BM and K and in BM and L (rs = 0. 92) as well as between Hg con-centrations in these tissues and BF. In addition, we found significant correlations between Hg concentrations in SC and BM (rs = 0. 72) and in L and K (rs = 0. 55). In con-clusion, mallard <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> response to envi-ronmental Hg pollution and meets the requirements of a bioindicator. Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic trace metals affecting living organisms. In nature, this element is present in the greatest concentrations in bituminous shales, basic crystalline rocks, clay and peat soils, oil, and coal. Hg enters the envi-ronment as a result of volcanic eruptions and also as a result of human activity, the latter being mainly associated with municipal waste, cement, paints, dental amalgams, the steel industry, and the burning of fossil fuels. Global Hg emissions in 2005 were 1930 tonnes, of which 1480 tonnes were from anthropogenic sources (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme/United Nations Environment Programme 2008). In Europe, Poland ranks second to Russia in emitting Hg into the environment, nearly 16 tonnes/y, which represents approximately 10 % of total European emissions (Arcti...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{enhancement}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 3 A receptor-mediated responses may have important consequences in the intoxicating and addictive properties of ethanol. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, ethanol-mediated {{enhancement of}} 5 -HT 3 receptor current {{has been proposed}} to occur due to stabilization of the open-channel state. It has not been possible to directly measure the open state of the channel due to the extremely low single-channel conductance of 5 -HT 3 A channels. Recently, three arginine residues within the large intracellular loop of the 5 -HT 3 A subunit were substituted by their equivalent residues (glutamine, aspartate, and alanine) of the 5 -HT 3 B subunit to produce a 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) subunit that forms functional homomeric channels <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> single-channel conductance. Using whole-cell rapid-agonist application techniques and the cell-attached single-channel recording configuration, we examined human 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The agonist sensitivity, macroscopic kinetics, and modulation by ethanol were similar between mutant and wild-type channels, suggesting the substitutions had not altered these channel structure-function properties. The open time histogram for single-channel events mediated by 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptors {{in the presence of}} maximal 5 -HT was best fit by three exponentials, but in the presence of ethanol a fourth open state was evident. In summary, the QDA substitution greatly enhanced single-channel conductance with little effect on 5 -HT 3 A channel's kinetic properties and ethanol enhances agonist action on 5 -HT 3 A receptors by inducing a new, long-lived open-channel state. Furthermore, the 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptor appears to be suitable for pharmacological studies of 5 -HT 3 A receptor modulation at a single-channel level...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the fractal {{curvature}} measures of invariant sets of one-dimensional conformal iterated function systems satisfying the open set condition exist, {{if and only if}} the associated geometric potential function is nonlattice. Moreover, in the nonlattice situation we obtain that the Minkowski content exists and prove that the fractal curvature measures are constant multiples of the δ-conformal measure, where δ denotes the Minkowski dimension of the invariant set. For the first fractal curvature measure, this constant factor coincides with the Minkowski content of the invariant set. In the lattice situation we give sufficient conditions for the Minkowski content of the invariant set to exist, contrasting the fact that the Minkowski content of a self-similar lattice fractal never exists. However, every self-similar set satisfying the open set condition <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> Minkowski <b>measurable</b> C^ 1 +α diffeomorphic image. Both in the lattice and nonlattice situation average versions of the fractal curvature measures are shown to always exist. Comment: 36 page...|$|R
40|$|Nano-rippled graphene, a {{structurally}} modified graphene, {{presents a}} novel material {{with a large}} range of possible applications including sensors, electrodes, coatings, optoelectronics, spintronics and straintronics. In this work we have synthesized macroscopic single layer graphene with well-defined uniaxial periodic modulation on a stepped Ir(332) substrate and transferred it to a dielectric support. The applied fast transfer process does not damage the Ir crystal which can be repeatedly used for graphene synthesis. Upon transfer, a millimeter sized graphene flake with a uniform periodic nano-ripple structure is obtained, which <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> macroscopically <b>measurable</b> uniaxial strain. The periodic one dimensional arrangement of graphene ripples was confirmed by atomic force microscopy and polarized Raman measurements. An important feature of this system is that the graphene lattice is rotated in several different, well-defined orientations {{with respect to the}} direction of the ripple induced uniaxial strain. Moreover, geometry of the ripples can be modified by changing the graphene synthesis parameters...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{social network}} {{visualizer}} “DySoN” (Dynamic Social Networks) aims at understanding patterns and structural changes in dynamic social networks that evolve over time via an interactive visualization approach. As an alternative and supplementation to the numerous other approaches to visualization of social network data {{and as an}} attempt to overcome some of the drawbacks of these approaches, DySoN interactively visualizes streaming event data of social interactions by an interactive three-dimensional model of interpolated NURBS ”tubes”, representing activity and social proximity within a given set of actors during a given time period by using three dimensions of temporal information mapping: spatial density (tube distance), tubecolor and tube-diameter. We use a self assembled large collaboration network of Jazz musicians with a straightforward semantics for the computation of relation strengths for the evaluation of the approach. We also discuss applications of the concept for awareness services in mobile peer to peer social networks, which <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> vivid <b>measurable</b> social micro dynamics in time and space...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an intensity-based notched polymer optical fiber (POF) fabric strain sensor and its application in human respiration monitoring. A mechanical analysis illustrates geometrical profiles of constrained fiber loops on the fabric substrate. V-shaped notches {{are made by}} laser ablation {{on the sides of}} the POFs. The effects of loop parameters and processing conditions on the sensing performance are investigated. The experimental results show that the fabric sensor is more sensitive to strain with notches on the outer side of the loops, a small radius of the loops and a low scanning speed of laser. This fabric sensor <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> large <b>measurable</b> strain range of up to 21 %. The achieved strain sensitivity is 3. 77. The temperature and relative humidity have little effect on strain sensitivity between 0 ¢J and 60 ¢J. A belt has been fabricated by integrating the fabric sensor for monitoring human respiration. The evaluation trials show a strong correlation between the belt system and a clinic monitor. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|A {{beta-lactamase}} {{produced by}} a penicillin-resistant strain of Serratia marcescens was isolated and purified. The kcat. value for benzylpenicillin was about 5 % of that observed for the best cephalosporin substrates. However, the low Km of the penam resulted in a high catalytic efficiency (kcat. /Km) and the classification of the enzyme as a cephalosporinase might not be completely justified. It also <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> low but <b>measurable</b> activity against cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefoxitin and moxalactam. Substrate-induced inactivation was observed both with a very good (cephalothin) or a very bad (moxalactam) substrate. The active site was labelled by beta-iodopenicillanate. Trypsin digestion produced a 19 -residue active-site peptide whose sequence clearly allowed the classification of the enzyme as a class C beta-lactamase. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} the fractal {{curvature}} measures of invariant sets of one-dimensional conformal iterated function systems satisfying the open set condition exist if the associated geometric potential function is nonlattice. Moreover, we prove that if the maps of the conformal iterated function system are all analytic, then the fractal curvature measures do {{not exist in the}} lattice case. Further, in the nonlattice situation we obtain that the Minkowski content exists and prove that the fractal curvature measures are constant multiples of the δ-conformal measure, where δ denotes the Minkowski dimension of the invariant set. For the first fractal curvature measure, this constant factor coincides with the Minkowski content of the invariant set. In the lattice situation we give sufficient conditions for the Minkowski content of the invariant set to exist, disproving a conjecture of Lapidus and standing in contrast {{with the fact that the}} Minkowski content of a self-similar lattice fractal never exists.

40|$|Cohnstein and Zuntz (1) {{were the}} {{earliest}} investigators who clearly {{pointed out that}} certain types of blood <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> metabolism involving the disappearance of oxygen and reduction of the hemoglobin. This metabolism was most evident in fetal blood, which, they observed, gradually darkened in color upon standing and upon evacuation liberated less oxygen than before. They ascribed this loss of oxygen to {{the action of the}} red cells, many of which, at the stage of development of the blood which they examined, still possessed large vesicular nuclei. Since then the metabolism of the blood has been very actively studied, notably by Warburg, by Morawitz, and by Harrop. The rather extensive literature has been well reviewed by Morawitz (2). In general, it may be summarized by stating that it is now agreed that the normal orthochromatic erythrocytes, which form {{the vast majority of the}} circulating red cells of mammals, have a negligible if any respiration (Daland and Isaacs (3)). On the other hand the polychromatic cells, which have been recently liberated from the bone marrow and which are found in large numbers in young animals and during active blood regeneration, <b>exhibit</b> <b>an</b> easily <b>measurable</b> consumption of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide. The earlier nucleated cells, ordinarily present only in the bone marrow in mammals, and the nucleated circulating erythrocytes of birds and amphibia, also respire very actively.
